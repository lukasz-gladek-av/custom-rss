			<p>It's a well-known fact that Star Wars: Jedi Survivor was not well-optimized for PC. Players were struggling with frame issues and stuttering consistently, which was also prominent in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. While the game is well-crafted and one of the better Star Wars games out there, those on PC got the short end of the stick.&nbsp; The developers released a statement saying their latest update would be fixing the performance issues and the excessive stuttering. However, it didn't fully hit the mark.</p>
<p>While it resolved some issues and increased the game's frame rate across the board, some traversal stutter issues remain. <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-patch-9-performance-improvements-pc/">This update also removed Denuvo</a>, an anti-tamper software disliked by the gaming community.</p>
<p>To explain the changes, Overclock3D wrote a <a href="https://overclock3d.net/reviews/software/is-star-wars-jedi-survivor-fixed-on-pc-update-9-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> about whether Update 9 fixed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PC. Although the game is significantly smoother than before, it is still seen as a CPU performance hog, especially if using ray-tracing effects. To ensure that the game ran even smoother, Overclock3D advised against using ray-tracing enabled. In their blog post, they examined the performance numbers using an RTX 4070 Ti. So, it's not as if the game was being run on a below-average rig, either.</p>
<p>Overall, the game's performance has considerably improved, with higher framerates. One of the main areas that was problematic for PC players was the village in Koboh, which, before the update, experienced significant stuttering. In the blog post, it's been said that it's much smoother than before, but there are still a few stutters left. Their blog post also features graphs showing how the game is doing from Patch 3.5 to Patch 9. While ray-tracing being enabled has improved in Patch 9, it's still quite intensive and challenging to deal with and will make you more susceptible to stuttering and an inconsistent frame rate.</p>
<p>For the most part, Patch 9 has done a great job of fixing some of the annoying issues fans were dealing with in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Whether there will be more patches in the future that will continue to deal with the traversal stuttering remains to be seen, but for now, the game is in a far better state than before the Patch 9 update for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/marvel-vs-capcom-collection-steam-reviews-1851649035<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Capcom released its latest compilation of retro arcade games to massive acclaim. <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em> features seven legendary titles, including a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432">stunningly faithful port of the arcade version of <em>The Punisher</em></a></span>,<em> </em>and the hugely influential <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-vs-capcom-arcade-classics-preview-1851634231&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-vs-capcom-arcade-classics-preview-1851634231"><em>Marvel Vs. Capcom 2</em></a></span>. Altogether, the seven games chart the history of Marvel and Capcom’s partnership and the amazing games that came out of it. Thank goodness for it, because until this collection was announced, many fans believed that they might be stranded on older systems.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,196790,194066" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For years, fans of these fighting games have found ways around Capcom’s reticence to port them everywhere. Services like Fightcade have existed for a long time now, allowing players who legally acquired the ROM files of these older games to play them with others online. That hasn’t stopped campaigns like #FreeMvC2 from taking off in the last few years, especially with the support of personalities in the fighting game community like the prominent Youtuber <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@Maximilian_Dood&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Maximilian_Dood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximillian_Dood</a></span>. With fighting games being bigger than ever, thanks to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248">widely observed tournaments like EVO</a></span> and the proliferation of titles like <em>Guilty Gear Strive </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>, there’s never been a better time to make these classics easily accessible. Now that the collection is finally out, folks are thrilled to have some of their favorite games readily available again.</p><p>The collection is more than just a few simple ports. All of the games feature online matchmaking—with some platforms faring better than others in this regard—and feature quality-of-life adjustments, like one-button-supers for beginners. Unfortunately, one-button-supers has not spared players online from being haunted by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/maybe-don-t-challenge-justin-wong-to-a-10-000-marvel-v-1847631978&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/maybe-don-t-challenge-justin-wong-to-a-10-000-marvel-v-1847631978">Justin Wong</a></span>, one of the fighting game community’s most prominent competitors,  known on the leaderboards as Wazzler. Since the collection was released, the FGC has already begun joking about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/marvel-vs-capcom-2s-return-plagued-by-matchmaking-issues-specifically-a-single-fighting-game-legend-whooping-players-so-hard-they-refund-the-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/marvel-vs-capcom-2s-return-plagued-by-matchmaking-issues-specifically-a-single-fighting-game-legend-whooping-players-so-hard-they-refund-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Wazzler is whooping people left and right</a></span> in pursuit of the No. 1 ranking online. Over the weekend, he even purchased the Switch version of the collection, and has publicly stated his intent to try yo get the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1835613055348363726&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1835613055348363726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top rank across three different platforms simultaneously</a></span>.</p><p>Unfortunately, everything is not exactly peachy on every platform. While consoles have had relatively few issues, PC players have been suffering through long matchmaking times, an inability to connect at all in some cases, the odd glitch or crash, and issues rebinding controls. And that’s all <em>before </em>getting their asses handed to them by Wong. While it’s definitely frustrated many players who have been looking forward to this collection for some time, these problems haven’t entirely slowed the game’s momentum or the outpourings of love.</p><p> Suffice to say, the community has shown up for this latest collection in tremendous force. <em>MvC2 </em>has now been freed, after all, and tons of other great games have come along with it. Their joy at the existence of this collection is utterly infectious, and nowhere does that seem more apparent than the game’s recent crop of Steam reviews. If you want a full picture of the <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom </em>experience, here it is. </p><figure id="" data-id="8ecae0035ef205c582baa3cc2d25559d" data-recommend-id="image://8ecae0035ef205c582baa3cc2d25559d" data-format="png" data-width="1270" data-height="422" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A positive Steam review rading &quot;Was really excited to finally play Marvel vs Capcom 2.

<p>PlayStation’s co-CEO recently spoke about how consoles are still “at the core” of their business even though they offer games for other platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC105XT0Q4A910C2000000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstations-co-ceo-insists-consoles-will-remain-the-core-of-its-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), PlayStation Co-CEO Hideaki Nishino discussed how PlayStation differs from other gaming platforms, such as mobile and PC. Nishino noted that mobile games are still flooded with advertisements, and PCs can be difficult to set up. However, with PlayStation consoles, players only need to turn them on to access their purchased content instantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nishino adds that the PlayStation store also provides players with ‘an intuitive experience” when purchasing new games, as all content is “laid out in an easy-to-understand manner”. The CEO then spoke about how they are increasing PlayStation’s share of the overall games market by developing content for PC. He states that “there is no doubt that consoles will be at the core of our business”, but by creating games for other platforms, PlayStation can reach a broader range of customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PlayStation has released several console games on PC in the past few years, including God of War (2018), Horizon Zero Dawn, Returnal, and more. However, they were released for PC months after the console release. The co-CEO believes this strategy of releasing the main instalments on the console first will cause PC players to want to buy a PlayStation console to play the games as they are released.</p>

Crafted by a team of industry veterans, including former Mass Effect staff from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-exodus-archetypes-ambitious-new-mass-effect-like-rpg-revealed-at-the-game-awards">BioWare and more recruits from 343, Naughty Dog, and other leading studios</a>, Exodus promises to deliver a "next-generation, story-driven RPG" that blends cinematic storytelling with modern AAA gameplay.</p><p>Collaborating on the project is renowned sci-fi author Peter F. Hamilton. Acclaimed for his expansive Commonwealth Saga and The Night's Dawn Trilogy, Hamilton has lent his world-building expertise to shape Exodus and its broader universe. Alongside consulting on the game, Hamilton is also penning a duology of books set in its universe. The first novel,<em> </em>Exodus: The Archimedes Engine, will be released on September 19, with <strong>preorders now available on </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVRn7?object_uuid=0c5dc33d-452a-4e64-ae43-4c9628de3916&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Amazon in the UK</strong></a><strong> and the </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yw0BO?object_uuid=0c5dc33d-452a-4e64-ae43-4c9628de3916&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>US</strong></a>. </p><p>We had the pleasure of interviewing the author, discussing The Archimedes Engine, his assistance in constructing the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/exodus-2024">Exodus</a> universe, and how his signature storytelling style brings depth and complexity to this expansive new sci-fi franchise.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think they saw me as someone who could contribute to the kind of Space Opera setting they were building for Exodus...</p></div><p><strong>The team at Archetype Entertainment has praised you for helping make the Exodus universe more scientifically accurate. What were some key areas where your expertise made a significant difference?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>The best example was my contribution to the method used by Celestial starships to travel between stars at just below lightspeed.  They’d got the basic requirements worked out, I just suggested a more practical method of doing what they wanted, especially in terms of the energy requirement of accelerating the huge mass of a starship up to those speeds.</p><p><strong>What were the biggest challenges in writing within a universe that’s being built for multiple platforms? Did any aspect of the world or characters evolve based on feedback from the game developers?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>The whole experience of working with others on this kind of huge-scale project was extremely satisfying. The Archetype team had already drawn up their basic guidelines, what they wanted to achieve, for the Exodus universe by the time I came on board. Being able to apply my take on those objectives was something very new for me. </p><p>Sometimes I’d have to come up with whole new technologies, which is relatively easy for a sci-fi writer; then again sometimes I’d have to find a very different societal structure for a Dominion, which means a lot of backstory as to why certain Celestials behave the strange way they do. </p><p>I’d send these in and get feedback, which would often necessitate tweaking the concepts to make them a better fit. I think we managed to get most ideas polished after a couple of revisions.  It was a very positive time for me.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>The Exodus universe is populated by great houses and expansive star systems. How much freedom do you have to invent and flesh out these factions, and do any of them play a key role in The Archimedes Engine?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>I wouldn’t describe it as having a freedom, given that I was one of the consultants that helped shape the nature of the Exodus universe. What that opportunity gave me was knowledge of what could and could not be out there. So when I needed to add a new Celestial species, society, or star system to the story, I knew what would fit into the universe and how to shape it accordingly. And yes, the Celestials play a huge part in the Archimedes Engine. They are not benign, which makes this a dangerous universe to explore, especially for humans.</p><p><strong>What challenges did you face in balancing scientific realism with the imaginative demands of world-building in Exodus?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>This is always a challenge for sci-fi. You want to push the envelope of what can be achieved, yet at the same time make it reasonably believable. In this case, the Archetype team had some good ground rules established for what they would and wouldn’t have in the Exodus universe. So in many respects it was like my usual worldbuilding, I always plot the parameters for what can be done before I start concentrating on the individual details. In other words: the team knew what they were doing.</p><p><strong>The Archetype Entertainment team has mentioned how much they admire your work. How did their familiarity with your novels influence the creative process during collaboration?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>That’s very kind of them. Given the type of novels and themes I usually write, that is: big stories set in the far future, I think they saw me as someone who could contribute to the kind of Space Opera setting they were building for Exodus. From my point of view, it was a great fit. I had a terrific time working with them.</p><div catalogid="62bf22ce-a327-4051-a655-ab47091f48d6" id="207004"><div id="207004" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Exodus: The Archimedes Engine</h3></p></div><p><strong>The collaboration between novelists and game developers can be tricky. How do you ensure that the story and gameplay align while still retaining the unique strengths of each medium?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>The simple answer to this is that The Archimedes Engine is not a novelisation of the game. It takes place in the Exodus universe, but over a century after the game, and in a different solar system. The characters featured in the Archimedes Engine don’t appear in the game, although they do provide a few glimpses and comments on some of the worlds you’ll encounter in the game.  So what the reader will take from this is an understanding of how the Exodus universe works in terms of its history and the people who live in it.</p><p><strong>Can you talk about the alien species or civilizations beyond the Celestials? How do they differ culturally or technologically from the human factions, and what roles do they play?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>There are no aliens in the Exodus universe in a biological sense. That was one of the more interesting draws for me when I was asked to join the project. All the life you encounter in the Exodus universe has a terrestrial origin — that doesn’t mean that humans don’t find very alien worlds and behaviours in the Centauri Cluster. The original humans have spent forty thousand years developing themselves in some very odd directions.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Exodus - Become The Traveller - The Archimedes Engine</h3></div></output></p><p><strong>You’ve mentioned time dilation as a key concept. How does it affect relationships, politics, or even warfare within this universe?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>It was one of the major themes that the game developers wanted to explore, as it allows the player to have a real understanding about the consequences of their decisions. This is all due to keeping interstellar travel limited to .999 lightspeed; so there is no faster than light travel. Which (quick explanation) thanks to Einstein’s relativity: if you travel a couple of light years to a new star at a fraction below the speed of light, it will seem like a week to those on board the starship, while years pass to those you’ve left behind.</p><p>Same principal applies for The Archimedes Engine, some choices taken by characters only become apparent to them decades later when they return home after such a flight. As to the warfare / conflict part, anyone undertaking a revolution or invasion has to plot out their moves at a grandmaster level.  Some actions won’t produce results for decades, if not longer. That means you have to be very certain the effect will play out as you expect before you launch it.</p><p><strong>In Exodus: The Archimedes Engine, Finn’s decision to become a Traveler seems pivotal to the plot. What makes the role of a Traveler unique within this universe, and how does it shape Finn’s journey?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>Travelers are unique in that they are a super-minority of the human population who do exactly that: travel. They are the ones who have the strength and determination to defy the Celestial Dominions, and try to carve out something for themselves, which requires a level of freedom most humans in the Centauri Cluster simply don’t have. </p><p>They see themselves as noble rebels and visionaries whose actions will one day lead their fellow humans out from under the oppression of the Dominions — and also make a decent profit on the side.  Whether those fellow humans see them in that light is another matter.</p><p><strong>The Exodus universe clearly draws on themes of power dynamics, exploration, and the search for freedom. How do these themes manifest in The Archimedes Engine, and how central are they to the broader narrative of the franchise?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>Those three themes are innate human qualities, so for me writing them was simply a reflection of past, current, and future life. Despite being set in 40,000 years' time, and featuring hundreds of Celestial (post-human) societies in their Dominions, the Archimedes Engine couldn’t not deal with such topics.  </p><p>In many respects these issues are what unifies us — the ‘us’ being what humans have evolved into in Exodus; despite all their differences and advanced physical and mental attributes, the Celestials can still be understood in purely human terms. However much they try to push their evolution they cannot throw off their heritage. In some cases, their technology and power even amplify those original biological traits.  All of which makes what we are and what we can become absolutely central to the story here.</p><p><strong>In The Archimedes Engine, how do the Celestials’ advanced evolution and technology impact their interactions with humanity? Are there moral or philosophical conflicts that arise due to these differences?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>All the time. It is a constant worry for humans, especially travelling to a Dominion about which they know very little. Sometimes they can be completely ignored, or despised, or told to "Get out!" in no uncertain terms. Travelers have to be so much more than just starship crews, explorers, and mercenary scavengers, they have to be diplomats of the highest order every time they emerge into a new star system. Many human Traveler starships simply don’t return home, and their families don’t know why.</p><p><strong>The relationship between the Celestials and human settlers seems to mirror historical patterns of colonization and empire-building. Was this parallel intentional, and how do you explore these dynamics in the story?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH:</strong> Some aspects can be drawn from and are reflected in history, some have more modern parallels.  In the Exodus universe, the Celestial Dominions have a considerable technological and economic superiority over the newcomers (humans) who are still arriving in their ancient ark ships.  </p><p>Celestials regard humans as completely inferior, which makes it hard for them to fit into the existing Dominions.  A development which feeds directly into the earlier question about freedom, and how powerful that desire features in what it is to be human. In effect, it becomes a mirror held up to the age-old question: how much freedom do you give up to live in an ordered society?</p><p><strong>What aspect of The Archimedes Engine are you most excited for readers to experience?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>I’m going to go with finding out what the Archimedes Engine itself <em>actually</em> does.</p><p>Exodus is expanding to more than just novels, and will be part of the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon">Secret Level animated series revealed at gamescom 2024</a>. Prime Video’s Secret Level is an anthology series by the creators of Love, Death + Robots. Each episode is basically a short film inspired by the characters and worlds of iconic video games like God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and Pac-Man.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-exodus-archetypes-ambitious-new-mass-effect-like-rpg-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Last year, also speaking with IGN</a>, James Ohlen, whose resume includes serving as a designer on Knights of the Old Republic and Dragon Age: Origins at BioWare, shed additional light on the long-awaited RPG, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-archetype-entertainment-to-develop-new-rpg">which was first teased back in 2020</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, the survival crafting experience found within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> itself, is getting ready to welcome players to an all-new mode known as The Lost Isles.</p>
<p>This is only the second Lego Fortnite expansion that includes a battle pass (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-adds-big-new-star-wars-world-this-week">first being Star Wars in May</a>).</p>
<p>On its debut, the Lost Isles will introduce players to five new blocky environments to explore: Beach, Plains, Jungle, Mountains and Floating Islands. While the beach is described as "a great place to pursue relaxation" (pirates aside), the jungle environment holds the potential for a scuffle with Storm-Wild Tomatoes.</p>

<p>Explorers will be able to get their hands on some new gear, to make traversing these new locales more unique. These tools include the Pirate Musket, Flint-Knock Pistol and Throwing Spears (which are obtained from the Peely Tribe, who make their home on the Plains).</p>
<p>In addition to the new kit, the Lego Fortnite developer has also upgraded the Essence Table to the Rune Forge. Here, players can "can craft Runes for strengthening your tools by spending Essence".</p>
<p>There will also be the chance to meet some new Fortnite Lego creatures known as Klombos. These chaps are said to be friendly, but you will need to feed them Klomberry to win them over. "Just, don't make it mad," the Lego Fortnite team warned.</p>

<p>Now, about that Battle Pass I mentioned. It's called the Tropical Treasures Lego Pass, and promises Decor and Builds for players to unlock.</p>
<p>Here's how the Tropical Treasures Lego Pass works:</p>
<ul>
<li>After selecting the Lego Fortnite experience in Fortnite, go to the Lego Pass button in the top navigation.</li>
<li>Here is where you'll see the Lego Pass and a button to view Quests. These Quests are about exploring Lost Isles. Complete them to earn Studs!</li>
<li>The more Studs you collect, the further you'll progress in the Lego Pass! Unlock in-game rewards from the free reward track as you progress. If you want, you can also unlock in-game rewards from the purchasable Premium Reward Track.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Premium Reward Track costs 1,400 V-Bucks, Epic said, and will be available to progress until 11th October. If you choose to purchase the Premium Reward Track, you will unlock the Island Adventure Peely Outfit.</p>
<p>Lego Fortnite: Lost Isles is set to arrive tomorrow, 17th September.  Further details can be found on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/explore-lost-isles-in-lego-fortnite-v31-20">Fortnite blog</a>.</p>

I have no particular interest in the plight of Optimus Prime and Megatron. I don’t know why those giant robots in disguise are fighting and am not terribly interested in finding out, unless I hear they’re going to kiss at some point in the film’s runtime. But what I do care about is a tragic, angsty, black-and-red hedgehog ready to destroy the world as revenge for the loss of his best friend. Sure, this print could be super lame, and it might even just be a printed screenshot from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-first-trailer-keanu-reeves-shadow-1851632082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-first-trailer-keanu-reeves-shadow-1851632082">the trailer Paramount released earlier this month</a></span>. But what if it’s actually sick art that will become a collector’s item that I want on my wall? I would be foolish to deny myself such an opportunity.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br8_YASkfb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda has released</a> a deep dive into the Starfield: Shattered Space expansion.</p>



<p>Releasing September 30, Starfield: Shattered Space features over 50 all-new locations, new gameplay mechanics, enemies, and more. </p>







<p>In the nearly 10-minute deep dive, Bethesda goes into detail on the environments and features the new expansion will hold. </p>



<p>“From the minute you arrive on Va’Ruun’kai, the story never sends you off planet,” lead creative producer  Tim Lamb said. “You’re free to leave at any time, but the story’s fully centered around life on the Va’Ruun home world.”</p>



<p>“Everything you discover; every location you visit; every side mission you seek out, it all tells the story of what happened here, ” Lead producer Joe Mueller  says, “and how the Va’Ruun people have survived, cut off from the comforts of the settled systems and the rest of humanity.”</p>



<p>You can watch the full Starfield: Shattered Space deep dive for yourself below. And be sure to let us know your thoughts on the upcoming expansion in the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>! </p>



<p>Starfield: Shattered Space will be available for $29.99. If you purchased the $99.99 Premium Edition of the game, however, you will get the expansion at no added cost on release.</p>

for AMD to apparently win the deal with Sony for the PS6--though keep in mind nothing has been officially announced.

                <p>Red Dead Redemption earned legions of fans when it launched in 2010, and the series’ popularity only grew when its sequel arrived in 2018. Featuring a memorable cast of characters, an unforgiving storyline, and gritty versions of the Wild West to explore, it’s arguably the best western video game series ever made. And if you’re looking to learn more about the world that inspired these hit games, you can now pick up a discounted version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas/dp/1250287707?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Red Dead’s History</a>--a hardcover book that takes a closer look at the history surrounding Rockstar’s iconic franchise.</p><div title="6526496 - Red Dead's History Book" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2667" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526496 - Red Dead's History Book" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas/dp/1250287707?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas\/dp\/1250287707?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas/dp/1250287707?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Red Dead’s History: A Video Game, an Obsession, and America’s Violent Past</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas/dp/1250287707?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas\/dp\/1250287707?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas/dp/1250287707?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$21 (was $30)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><span>Red Dead’s History hit bookshelves last month, but it’s already seeing a nice discount. For just $21, you’ll get an in-depth look at the history that inspired both games. Written by history professor Tore C. Olsson, it covers everything from the Wild West and the Deep South to Appalachia and more. The book has earned positive reviews from critics, and it’s an easy recommendation for fans of the series.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>The book covers a large portion of US history between 1870 and 1920, giving you an extensive look at the world that shaped Rockstar’s two iconic titles. Olsson is a professor of American history at the University of Tennessee, and he shares a wealth of information across the book's 288 pages, all of which relate back to the game’s characters, setting, and storyline. It wasn't written in collaboration with Rockstar, but it's still an excellent source of background info.</p><p>A sample is available for free on Amazon, giving you a chance to skim through a few pages before making your decision. It’s unclear how long this price cut will last, however, so swing by and check it out soon if you’re interested.</p><p>Consider pairing Red Dead’s History with some other gaming books, as there are plenty that would make a great companion for it on your bookshelf.

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cities: Skylines 2</a> was released in October 2023 and was due to receive some creator packs and a whole expansion, but they have all since been delayed, as Paradox and Colossal Order posted in a new Steam post. The Creator Packs named Modern Architecture and Urban Promenades are being pushed back to Q4 of this year, while the Bridges &amp; Ports major expansion will launch in Q2 of 2025 instead.</p>
<p>Compared to the first Cities: Skylines game, this one wasn't as well received and has a Mixed review rating on Steam. This predominantly comes from people who pre-ordered and still haven't received items they were promised to receive as a gift for pre-ordering. The game is also incredibly broken and bug-ridden. On top of that, they now have to deal with the delays of the new Creator Packs and significant expansion.</p>
<p>The delays are being made so that both Paradox and Colossal Order can focus on the upcoming Asset Editor, which is something else that players have complained about. They noticed a severe lack of custom assets, making the gameplay feel samey and rushed. Instead of focusing on the expansions, they are funneling all of their focus into the Asset Editor, which is described as being "one of the most crucial remaining features" for modding.</p>
<p>In addition, the studios are saying that the delays will allow them to make the game enjoyable for the community, which as stated above, is an ongoing concern, as the game launched with a myriad of issues that are still there, even today.</p>
<p>In addition to PC delays, Cities: Skylines 2 still isn't out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, adding to the community's increasing frustration. It seems the developers are spinning too many plates, as they have a significant amount of base content to work on before they can focus on the Creator Packs and expansion.</p>
<p>The one main issue that Colossal Order is set on fixing and making more enjoyable for players is the issue with hotels and tourism. They are also working on the various bugs and performance issues that those playing it are experiencing. The difficulty is another area that is deemed problematic, as it is seemingly unbalanced, regardless of what difficulty you are on. As a result, they are also working on this to try and make the game more balanced and playable in every aspect.</p>
<p>Although it's taking a while, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/7373044403862069994?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam post</a> gives the energy and impression that the developers care about the project and are putting fans' happiness at the forefront of their concerns.</p>

			<p>The next generation of Far Cry branded games is in the works, judging from a recent job ad from Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The job ad is for a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000004230907-3d-programming-team-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D Programmer Team Lead</a> who will be responsible for leading a team of 3D programmers in the development of the next generation of Far Cry-branded games. Unfortunately, this is everything the job ad says regarding the celebrated series, as the key responsibilities and required qualifications listed do not even provide hints on the technology that could power such games.</p>
<p>The future of the Far Cry series is pretty much unknown at this point, and everything we know about the seventh entry in the series comes from rumors. <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-rumor-non-linear-story-interrogations-timed-structure/">Last year</a>, the ever-reliable Tom Henderson revealed that the next entry in the franchise will feature a non-linear story involving the head of a wealthy family who has been kidnapped by the Sons of the Truth cult, and it will be up to the player how and when to save the members of the family. A time limit of 72 in-game hours, 24 real-world hours, will add to the experience, as do the narrative changes caused by the choices players make while attempting to save the kidnapped relatives. A second Far Cry project, known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-far-cry-multiplayer-2025-alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Maverick</a>, is also said to be in development, and these two could very well be the next-generation games mentioned in the job ad.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Far Cry 6. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/far-cry-6-anton-castillo-will-see-you-now/">review.</a></p>

The teaser’s shots of <em>Nocturne</em>’s heroes make it seem like season 2 will see them being haunted by memories of all they’ve lost. But the brief flashes of a cross engulfed in pink flames also feels like it could be a nod to the show bringing back certain characters like Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson).</p><p>The teaser makes clear that as bleak as things have gotten for Richter and his allies, they still intend to slash down any monsters that cross their paths. And while Netflix hasn’t given the season an exact premiere date, we now know the show will return in January 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>What time is it on the Moon? NASA is trying to figure that out. Together with other global partners, the US space agency is launching a new effort to try to establish a coordinated time for the Moon. The aim is to create a Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) so everyone can be on the same page. Who knows, if people ever live on the Moon--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nasa-delays-plans-to-put-humans-back-on-the-moon/1100-6520208/" data-ref-id="1100-6520208">that is actually a real plan of the new Artemis program</a>--this could be important to know when the new Call of Duty comes out.</p><p>NASA's Space Communication and Navigation program is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/nasa-to-develop-lunar-time-standard-for-exploration-initiatives/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=NASA&amp;utm_campaign=NASASocial&amp;linkId=591102347" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">taking point</a> alongside other members of the US government and "international standards organizations." How will they come up with a time?</p><p>NASA said it will be determined by a "weighted average of atomic clocks on the Moon." This is similar to how Earth's Coordinate Universal Time (UTC) is calculated. However for Coordinated Lunar Time, scientists have some additional issues to overcome.</p><p>"Exactly where at the Moon is still to be determined, since current analysis indicates that atomic clocks placed at the Moon's surface will appear to 'tick' faster by microseconds per day," NASA said. "A microsecond is one millionth of a second. NASA and its partners are currently researching which mathematical models will be best for establishing a lunar time."</p><p>NASA says this is a critical undertaking in part because the space organization aims to send humans back to the Moon in its Artemis program and to establish a "sustained presence" or and around the Moon.</p><p>"The approach to time systems will also be scalable for Mars and other celestial bodies throughout our solar system, enabling long-duration exploration," NASA said.</p><p>There is also a need for a time standard because the commercial space industry is growing quickly, and accurate and coordinated time-keeping is important for safe and sustainable journeys, NASA said.</p><p>In terms of the commercial space industry, just last week, SpaceX took astronauts higher into space than anyone has gone in 50 years and conducted the first commercial spacewalk. Billionaire Jared Isaacman paid his way and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/spacex-spacewalk-private-polaris-dawn-87d4c78853f0249baf29631bedfac749" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">completed the spacewalk alongside astronaut Sarah Gillis</a>. Both successfully splashed down off Florida on Sunday. In less-than-ideal space travel news, the astronauts who went to the International Space Station in June <a href="https://apnews.com/article/stuck-astronauts-boeing-starliner-nasa-1933b64f91ba06713e57446e2dbee1c4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remain stuck there</a> due to issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule.</p>

            <p>Yes, Valve is still working on an anticheat for its new shooter, Deadlock.</p>
<p>A developer for Deadlock - the hero shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Valve wouldn't admit existed</a> even after it had hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">a concurrent player peak of over 16,000</a> last month - first confirmed on the game's Discord server that it was working on anticheat back on 11th August.</p>
<p>Since then, the development team has dropped several updates saying it "certainly considers [cheating] a very high priority in the long term", and had "a group of people working on anti cheat".</p>

<p>However, the game's reddit community has seen dozens of complaints from players, including one post yesterday that asserts one player encountered "three cheaters in a row today".</p>
<p>Consequently, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/valve-developer-has-to-keep-reminding-players-that-deadlock-s-anti-cheat-system-is-coming-and-very-high-priority-since-it-s-leaning-mostly-on-player-reports-right-now/">PC Gamer</a>, the team is relying on players to report cheaters manually via its Discord server.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1fhdbes/3_cheaters_in_a_row_today/">3 Cheaters in a row today</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarming_Still_5030/">u/Alarming_Still_5030</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/">DeadlockTheGame</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"If you think someone is cheating in the game, please report it in the #reports channel of the official Deadlock Discord by Valve," the moderation team explains.</p>
<p>"You can get the invite for it in the game's main menu. Cheat reports are quickly manually being worked on while an anti cheat is still being developed."</p>
<p>Deadlock reached a new peak concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">171,490 players</a> when it was finally announced at the end of last month. There is still no actual release date for Deadlock, however, and it can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">only be played via invite at the time of writing</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus.982083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new integrated mod manager for Baldur's Gate 3 has been highly successful, with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-downloads-are-at-5-4-million-in-just-four-days/">5.4 million downloads</a> in just four days.&nbsp;<span>Using the unlocked version of the official modding tool released by Larian Studios, a modder has created new areas for players to explore. The user has been posting screenshots on Reddit under the name <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/katszenBurger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">katzenBurger</a>, where they post areas such as a castle on the shore and</span>&nbsp;Avernus.</p>
<p>Avernus is an area that is mentioned a huge amount throughout the game for different characters' storylines, and it was an area that players were desperate to see in-game. Avernus is the first layer of hell in the Dungeons and Dragons multiverse, but unfortunately won't ever be seen officially in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>This isn't a surprise to many fans, as Larian Studios confirmed a while ago that they are not working on any expansions for Baldur's Gate 3 or any follow-up game. As a result, the modding tool has been implemented to give players a new playground to have fun. The modding tool was added on September 9. Still, players have found a way to use an 'unlocked' version of the modding tool created by Larian Studios, which is exactly what is allowing katzenBurger to create new maps and locations for the game.</p>
<p>A video of the castle area and Avernus has been uploaded to YouTube, showcasing some of the area and detailing it. According to KatzenBurger, using the mod tool to make maps is incredibly easy, as it opens it up to other players trying to create their maps, too.</p>
<p><iframe title="baldurs gate 3 toolkit unlocked map test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LOF3d7aLZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Console players will now be able to enjoy the mods that are made using the Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit exclusively. Still, for those made using the "unlocked" tool, it means that the console players won't be able to access them unless Larian decides to unlock the toolkit fully. However, it's unlikely that will be happening, as CEO Swen Vincke said in March that wouldn't be happening. Still, depending on how successful these mods are once they are full released, it could be a game changer for Larian Studios.</p>
<p>The toolkit was released as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/">Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was claimed to be the final update for the game. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-gets-more-details-ahead-of-its-september-launch-wont-be-the-final-update/">Larian Studios has confirmed that it isn't the final update</a>&nbsp;but doesn't want to talk about what is yet to come in future updates. However, the most recent update provided a lot of new variations, adding new Legendary Actions, 13 new cinematics for your evil playthrough, and Honor Mode improvements.</p>
