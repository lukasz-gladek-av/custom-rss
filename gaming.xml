            <p>If you've been necromantically dreaming of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> sequel, I'm afraid the monkey paw finger hasn't just curled - it's jammed itself right up your nose and scratched an FU on your hypothalamus. Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a>, a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.</p>
<p>The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game go?</p><!--more-->

<p>In [REDACTED], you are a lone security guard trying to make it out of Black Iron Prison, the original game's Jovian correctional facility. In The Callisto Protocol, you slithered and skulked through crammed and shadowy corridors, fending off squamous mutant convicts in a passable facsimile of Dead Space. In [REDACTED], you beast hordes of colourful monsters in frenetic Hades-style arena brawls. There are skills to upgrade, metas to finesse, "experiments" (mods, I guess?) to equip, weapons and suits to loot.</p>
<p>"This game is all about fighting, dying, dying again, dying some more, and adapting, taking the classic roguelike formula and cranking it to eleven," bellows the press release, because nothing says "punk rock" like unironically quoting a piece of mockumentary dialogue that was originally intended as a gag about the meaninglessness of rising numbers. At the very least, I'd like video games to start cranking it to 12. Maybe next time.</p>
<p>I'm probably being too mean. Or at least, I'm venting too much at the press release, and not saying enough about the game. Forgive the Poochie The Dog presentation and judge it purely as a genre piece with no Callisto affiliations, and [REDACTED] seems performant enough. The visuals are very Void Bastardy and hey, the melee combat certainly looks more entertaining than that of The Callisto Protocol, which admittedly is a bit like saying that running a cheesegrater over your face is more fun than sitting on a blowtorch. The game has at least one clever idea, though I don't think it's unique to [REDACTED]: when you die, your corpse revives as an enemy equipped with all the gear and upgrades you were carrying.</p>
<p>Each run is an exercise in crafting a bossfight, in other words, and I do wonder how that might affect your tactics deeper in: if you confident you're going to cop it, should you throw away all of your potent gear to make life easier for your successor? Aside from your own reanimated flesh, the game also features other human survivors locked in the same race for the very last prison escape pod. They'll either try to kill you directly or throw "unexpected challenges" into your path. Typical geezer shenanigans. When will they learn.</p>
<p>[REDACTED] is out 31st October. If you preferred the previous incarnation of Black Iron Prison, you might be interested in former Striking Distance bossman Glen Schofield's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-should-be-a-callisto-protocol-2-says-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-we-had-to-cut-two-and-a-half-bosses">thoughts about the rigours of development and their abandoned plans for a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That means that for just six bucks, you’re probably getting hundreds of hours of entertainment as you try and develop your own civilization with any number of <em>CIv 6</em>’s available leaders.</p><p>In case you’re new here, the <em>Civilization </em>series are strategy games that allow you to develop your own nations, and, eventually, empires. You can customize the minutiae of these societies, including their values, religions, and technologies, and you can pursue a number of different paths to progress your society, hence the moniker for <em>Civ</em>’s subgenre 4X, which stands for explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. You can come into conflict with other civilizations and famous world leaders (including a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/civilization-creator-shoots-down-our-memories-of-a-nuke-1845006305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-creator-shoots-down-our-memories-of-a-nuke-1845006305">hilariously nuke-happy Gandhi</a></span>) and can win these encounters, and the game, through various different means, including warfare or diplomacy.<br></p><p><em>Civ 6 </em>is the most recent entry, despite being released nearly ten years ago now, but it’s been thoroughly supported since then. In the intervening years, it has received at least two major expansions, and a number of smaller expansions adding new leaders, civilizations, and mechanics (like freakin’ climate change) to the game until as recently as early 2023. If you’re at all interested in getting more out of the game,<strong> you can pick up the expansions at about $5 apiece</strong>, or you could buy one of two bundles packaging the DLC.</p><p><strong>The first bundle, called <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 6 Platinum Edition</em>, packs the two major expansions and about half of the smaller DLCs for about $12 right now on Steam.</strong> <strong>Alternatively, if you feel like you’re ready to go all in on <em>Civ 6 </em>ahead of the upcoming sequel next year, you can grab the anthology bundle that includes everything for just $25.</strong> In total, you’d be getting the base game and 18 DLCs spanning about a decade of content. I don’t think you could possibly get more out of the <em>CIv </em>series outside of playing every previous game.<br></p><p>Though you should be set with just that game, some of the other modern games in the series are also on sale. <strong><em>Civ 5 </em>is pretty cheap right now, only running you about $5</strong>, and if you want to go even further back,<strong> <em>Civ 4 </em>is going for $3</strong>. Don’t worry though, you don’t need to play <em>Civ 1-6 </em>in order to understand <em>Civ 7</em>. Common misunderstanding around these parts.<br></p><p>As someone curious about the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc-1766534236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc-1766534236">best PC strategy games</a></span>, and who’s been dipping their toes into PC gaming in general of late, it feels blasphemous to <em>not </em>have a single <em>Civ </em>game on my hard drive. Maybe today’s the day I fix that and get myself amped for the next game, which I’m sure I’ll be hearing about for the next decade following its release. We may as well all jump on board now, and who wouldn’t for these insanely low prices.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-datamining-has-changed-the-landscape-of-video-game-puzzle-and-secret-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last year, Blizzard launched a new event in World of Warcraft: Classic called Season of Discovery. The game mode offered players the chance to explore an old-school version of the MMORPG as it existed back in 2004, but with a twist. Players would be able to collect “runes” that would transform their characters into wacky new variations like mage healers or shaman tanks. New quests and other secrets were said to pepper the world, and certain dungeons were converted into larger, more challenging raids with new bosses and new loot. It was an exciting event, one that hinged on surprise and, as the title suggested, discovery. </p><p>The problem? Datamining. Through datamining, curious players were able to “discover” all the new runes, bosses, spells, and loot before they had even set foot in Azeroth.</p><p>True, not everything was spoiled out of the gate. Datamining, at its simplest, enables players to view basically any file in the game: images, text strings, locations. But none of those files are available in context. In Season of Discovery, players could see the names and uses of all the runes, but still had to find the runes in game, which often required solving puzzles or exploring areas off the beaten path. But the prevalence of spilled secrets before the event even started did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/17s3i7k/season_of_datamining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>prompt some players</u></a> to quip on the irony of datamining in a “Season of Discovery.” Prominent World of Warcraft guide site Wowhead ended up <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/wowhead-statement-on-datamining-season-of-discovery-phase-2-337449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>backing off publishing datamined info</u></a> in response to community feedback. Even <a href="https://x.com/AggrendWoW/status/1772710836496134317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>developers commented on the issue</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Season of Discovery is a particularly poignant example of World of Warcraft’s ongoing relationship with dataminers, the truth is that the entire game has been like this for years. Because Blizzard uses Public Test Realms (PTR) to test content before it goes live, dataminers have a ready supply of new tidbits of information to dump onto websites, guides, forums, and social media sites before the vast majority of players encounter them in regular gameplay. And Blizzard isn’t alone, either. In recent years, a number of games centering concepts such as discovery and secret-hunting have been forced to reckon with the challenges posed by dataminers. Live service games like Destiny 2 and Helldivers 2 face similar challenges as World of Warcraft, while even single-player games centered around secrets like Tunic and Animal Well have found creative ways to hide their biggest, most interesting twists.</p><p>Working against dataminers to hide secrets is a losing battle, which is why some developers are taking a different approach. Increasingly, creators are designing their games’ biggest surprises around the expectation that someone, somewhere, will crack them open and learn everything about them instantly.</p><h2>Flavor Crystals</h2><p>Jeremy Feasel is an associate game director on World of Warcraft, but he quips to me that his actual job is to add “flavor crystals” to World of Warcraft: that is, secrets or other fun little diversions. He started in the Cataclysm expansion working on rare spawns, which usually meant mounts that were difficult to obtain. But whenever he had a little time, he says, he would get up to some wacky stuff. </p><p>Which is how World of Warcraft players were introduced to Dormus, the Camel Hoarder.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Dormus is part of a fun little secret chain that ultimately rewards players with a rideable camel. To start, players come across a “Mysterious Camel Figurine” which is a very small statuette that can be found randomly in one of 50 different spots in the large, sandy region of Uldum. Most of the time, finding a figurine and clicking on it will simply cause it to crumble to dust. Only very rarely will it teleport players to Dormus to receive the camel, making the mount itself very rare, random, and time-consuming to find – even if you know exactly <em>how </em>to find it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I got WoW access and was like, what can I do with this?</p></div><p>“I got WoW access and was like, what can I do with this?” Feasel recalls. “I'm going to try adding 50 spawn points, will it let me? And then I tried to put the 51st spawn point in and I got an error and that's when I discovered there were limits to the things that I could do. So then I put it on a crazy timer so that it would still be really difficult to get. And then I was thinking, you know, what else can I do with this? I'll teleport you up to the steam pools and make you fight a guy. Why not have him carrying around camels and throwing camels at you? Because, of course, why not?</p><p>“I sent the email off to the WoW directors at that point. So proud of myself though. Very first thing that I had added to the game and I'll never forget, I got an email back from, I think our lead class designer at the time, Greg Street, saying, ‘Hey, this is exactly the kind of stuff that makes World Warcraft a great world to explore.’ And I think that was probably the thing that kicked off my desire to do more of those.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dormus and his camels were one of World of Warcraft’s earliest efforts at deliberately hiding these kinds of secrets. Since then, Feasel and his colleagues have tried to add more secrets, and specifically ones that dataminers couldn’t find. Feasel tells me they “tried every trick in the book”, recalling hiding pages around the world in Battle for Azeroth with riddles on them. Dataminers could easily datamine all the riddles, but the riddles themselves would still have to be solved.</p><p>“We discovered that 50,000 people can go and look at everything in World of Warcraft in a week pretty effectively,” Feasel says. “It doesn't actually take them that much time to canvas the entire universe. And that was my first learning of, ‘Oh, I'm going to have to do better than this. I'm going to have to try harder to make each individual piece more difficult to figure out.’”</p><p>Over time, WoW’s penchant for riddles sparked a vibrant secret-finding community within the game. There’s a secret-finding Discord server, and communities like Wowhead routinely track and celebrate potential secrets, hints, and their eventual solutions. With so many people working constantly to solve the riddles Feasel creates, he’s had to get increasingly creative. For instance, when trying to conceal the Lucid Nightmare mount from players, he “added a bunch of items and a bunch of quests that just went nowhere and did nothing.” And more recently, Feasel worked on an in-game event focused on treasure hunting, entitled <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/world-events/secrets-of-azeroth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Secrets of Azeroth</u></a>. He hopes the event served as “an on-ramp” for players who loved the idea of secrets but didn’t usually have the time or interest in joining secret-finding community groups. </p><p>Like Feasel, Ben Cureton has embraced the chaos of player secret hunting in his work on Remnant 2. As the principal designer on the franchise, Cureton says he and his team’s job is to make “every toy that the player plays with,” including guns, archetypes, rings, and so forth. While Cureton loves to hide goofy breadcrumbs for players, he has also struggled with dataminers over the years. He recalls a situation years ago in the first Remnant, where dataminers uncovered an item called “Toxic Juju” that they were certain had to be <em>some</em> secret. In reality, Toxic Juju was just a leftover test item that didn’t lead to anything and never was intended to. But the brief fervor over its inclusion gave Cureton an idea. What if he hid something in Remnant 2 that <em>only</em> dataminers could find?</p><p>Which is how Cureton and his teammates ended up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remnant-2s-wild-data-mining-puzzle-was-solved-by-someone-with-no-coding-experience-a-fridge-full-of-red-bull-and-chatgpt"><u>hiding an entire class</u></a> – the Archon – behind datamining.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Cureton recalls sitting in the “Cult of the Door” Discord, the group of secret finders trying to crack the mysterious red door that hid the class, and watching them unravel it together. It took them roughly 28 hours, he says, and he personally felt accomplished when they didn’t get it within the first hour. But he was also glad it didn’t take them days or weeks. “Our goal is never to antagonize the player,” he says. “We're not trying to do anything other than be a game, one of the games that have ridiculous secrets.” </p><p>In Remnant 2’s case, Cureton and his team’s experiment with datamining paid off. Players had a great time, and the developers were inspired to find even more creative ways to surprise their community in the future just by watching the players progress.</p><p>“We get to participate in watching somebody else play the game and watching the community come together to try to solve puzzles because we never get to experience Remnant like a player,” he says.</p><h2>Rabbit Holes</h2><p>Andrew Shouldice tells me he wasn’t thinking too hard about how to hide secrets from dataminers when he first started working on his single-player, secret-stuffed game: Tunic.</p><p>“If someone is interested in playing your game, they're probably not going to look stuff up,” he says. “Think of Ace Attorney, right? You're playing an Ace Attorney game, you start the game and you think, ‘Well, I should look up the whole script and read the solution to everything.’ No, you probably don't want to do that. If the way you want to enjoy the game is to play it and figure things out yourself, then you're probably going to do that.”</p><p>But even with that belief, Shouldice inadvertently designed a game that turned out to be pretty hard to crack. He tells me he used “a piece of technology that's part of Unity called IL2CPP, which takes the intermediate language that C# is compiled into and then mangles it a bunch and turns it into C++ code.” As a result, he says, the whole game “is a bit more opaque.”</p><p>Beyond the code, Tunic’s very design naturally evades reading files for solutions or secrets. Much of its puzzles rely on collecting manual pages throughout the game, and then solving a secret within the images themselves. A dataminer could conceivably see all the pages without collecting them, but they still needed to understand the manual’s cryptic notes and esoteric sketches. And still further beyond that, some of Tunic’s deepest puzzles rely on understanding the game’s mysterious, in-universe written language, and its even more mysterious musical language. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tunic Screens (Nintendo Direct - Sept 2022)</h3></div></output><p>“Those assets are in the game, so people will probably find that first by blowing it open,” Shouldice says. “You have access to the music just fine, but digging around isn't going to give you what you're looking for. The puzzle is in figuring out the information that you have.”</p><p>Taken together, Shouldice and his colleagues managed to design Tunic in such a way where players could, in theory, datamine out all the scenes in the game and “experience probably some amount of joy, but I’ve never heard of someone doing that because that’s not fun.”</p><p>Still, Shouldice wanted to tease players who were determined to go the extra mile for secrets. There are a number of locations in Tunic that cannot be reached by most people playing normally, but can be snuck into via various exploits. There, Shouldice planted little signposts that produced a single word in Tunic’s in-universe text. When translated, the signpost simply read “egg.”</p><p>Billy Basso’s game, Animal Well, is often mentioned in the same breath as Tunic due to its penchant for secrets. But while Shouldice wasn’t worried about datamining in his early development, Basso recalls hearing lots of defeatist attitudes from other developers about datamining over the years that colored his impression for a while. He says he was told by others to not even bother trying to conceal elements of games he made from players. Everyone would just find it anyway.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wanted to recreate that old school experience pre-internet of people word of mouth trading tips about a game.</p></div><p>So, naturally, Basso found a way to program his game not to allow datamining at all.</p><p>“I kind of wanted to push back against that and see what it would take to recreate that old school experience pre-internet of people word of mouth trading tips and their experiences about a game, and to recreate that sense of mystery and wonder that I feel like I remember games having growing up,” he says.</p><p>Basso explains that he programmed Animal Well in C++ in his own custom engine, for which there are no existing tools to unpack the files. “You have to get serious about really reverse engineering the machine code,” he says. “For my assets, I don't use any text or strings. If you go through the animations or the code, there's nothing you can read to make sense of it. It's all just numbers and machine instructions.</p><p>“Then for the really serious stuff, the files are actually encrypted with AES encryption, which should in theory be unbreakable. It's what you would use to encrypt network traffic or something. Typically that still shouldn't be that secure because you need the key to decrypt the files, and you have to put the key in the code so it knows how to decrypt it. But instead, the key is actually input through your actions in the game. You the player have to indirectly enter the key into the world, and then it will be able to unlock things. It's easier to just play the game and figure out the puzzles than to hack it.”</p><p>But Basso didn’t just stop at trying to prevent dataminers. Animal Well is fundamentally a game about discovering secrets, and he knew players would use any means necessary to crack its most challenging puzzles. Guides, speedrunning tricks, you name it, Basso tried to prepare for it.</p><p>For instance, one of Animal Well’s late-game treasure hunts involves <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-well-contains-a-hidden-puzzle-that-requires-at-least-50-people-to-complete"><u>finding 16 well-hidden rabbits</u></a>. But Basso hid additional bonus bunnies in completely inaccessible areas that, if the player manages to collect by tricking the game somehow, will lock them out of the actual 16-bunny reward. Elsewhere, Basso included a room that’s visible in a normal playthrough, but isn’t accessible without clipping through walls or using other tricks. When you enter, you’re rewarded with a “Cheater’s Ring” that allows your character to wallclip freely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Basso’s efforts to prevent datamining largely succeeded, but his secrets were still cracked within a matter of days thanks to the power of jolly cooperation. When I interviewed him, Animal Well was on the cusp of release, and Basso believed his most difficult puzzles might elude the community for weeks, months, maybe even years. Then, Animal Well launched, and Basso’s weirdest secret was found roughly within a week thanks to a diligent, secret-hungry community working round the clock. He’s taking it in stride, though.</p><p>”It does let me know that, in a future game, there's kind of no limit to how obscure you can make something,” <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/animal-well-interview-billy-basso" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he told Game File</u></a>.</p><h2>Inscrutable Quantum Devices</h2><p>Jeff Hamilton is currently a game designer at Riot Games, though when I spoke to him he was clear that we were only speaking about his past experiences working on both World of Warcraft and League of Legends: Wild Rift. Hamilton is a veteran dataminer dodger, and he’s got some theories, from a developer perspective, about why players love datamining so much. Especially in live service games, players “want to know everything as soon as they possibly can so that they can make all the best decisions about all their resources.” For them, “information is power.” </p><p>“They want to understand how they're all put together, and there's this conflict sometimes also with the games being so permanent that they want to feel like they don't make any mistakes,” he explains. “There's a need for datamining to…comfort themselves with a sort of security blanket, like an assurance that this guess they have about how they want to build their character is actually correct, defensible, playable. And that's a pattern that we've seen across many, many games over the years.”</p><p>Hamilton tells me that during his time working on World of Warcraft, there was a good rule of thumb for everyone: if you’re making something on your machine and you hit “Save,” players are going to see it. That’s been true for years, he says, going all the way back to the heyday of Everquest where fansites would just datamine and list every single thing in the entire game: every item, every spell, every location, everything. Now, those databases still exist, but players often rely on influences and theorycrafters to help them make sense of the massive dumps of information, which in turn helps it spread even further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even with players combing over everything, Hamilton says he never felt datamining took the wind out of his sails on something he was actively making. “But I do think probably that the existence of data mining changed what I would or wouldn't make,” he adds. He tells me about working on Patch 8.2, Mechagon, and wanting to make a particular puzzle. But he recalls deciding not to do it, because the only way he could make it fun for the entire playerbase would require “six times as much time as I would have needed if I didn’t have to worry about all the pieces being datamined.”</p><p>But in another case, Hamilton was actively able to use datamining to playfully confuse secret hunters. He recalls working on an item called the “Inscrutable Quantum Device,” a trinket with a use listed in-game as “???” His hope was that players would simply try it out and see what happens, without expectations.</p><p>“So the way that I made this was to make one spell that had this tooltip with the question marks and then to make a bunch of other spells that it would determine, by some logic, which to actually cast. I was able to give it 13 different effects that kind of hinted at what the logic might be because I knew that players’ first step in figuring out how this would work would be to look up the item. And then their second step would be to look up the same name and they would see that there are 14 spells that are all named Inscrutable Quantum Device. Interesting. So we could get away with this sort of obtuseness that might otherwise be super frustrating because I knew that players had the tools to put the puzzle together.”</p><p>World of Warcraft is big enough and well-resourced enough to carefully walk the line between supporting the player desire to know everything while still concealing its biggest secrets. Over the years, the team has used a number of tactics to conceal secrets, such as waiting to implement certain items or cutscenes until launch, using techniques to mask specific dialogue from curious dataminers, or even just making statements around PTR patches indicating that content was not final. But not every game has that luxury, says Hamilton. When he worked on Wild Rift, for instance, there were only 40 people working on it, and there wasn’t time to build an engineering solution to datamining. They were too busy making sure matchmaking worked. Many other games are in this same predicament.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don't think there's any point in getting mad at people for following the impulses of what is interesting to them.</p></div><p>While Hamilton thinks datamining is cool and fundamentally comes from players enjoying and wanting to understand a game better, it does sometimes come into conflict with what developers want to do with said game. He describes players as effectively split into two camps: those who want to understand everything, and those who want to explore and experience new things. Sometimes, the desires of the first group conflict with the desires of the second group, especially when it comes to datamining. That’s just a reality of game development, he says, and one that game developers have to take into account.</p><p>“I don't think there's any point in getting mad at people for following the impulses of what is interesting to them and stuff like that,” he says. “...Sorry, you're making games for humans and that's just part of the deal. But I do think it would be interesting for dataminers to sort of reflect on or be introspective about the times where the thing they're making for the audience that wants categorization can ruin the experience for the audience that wants novelty and wants exploration.”</p><p>Datamining can be a frustrating reality that game developers often have to work around, especially when trying to hide interesting secrets or puzzle solutions that are intended to take extra effort to solve. And it can present interesting challenges to developers of live service games in particular, who may need to field community feedback on changes that aren’t ready for primetime.</p><p>“The Internet moves so quickly nowadays,” Feasel says. “There's a couple of things that I think that we've changed up in just our general process that I think have helped make it more of a fundamentally positive thing. Something really exciting to see is [the day a new patch gets datamined], where all this stuff shows up and all the really cool models show up and they get to see all these interesting changes and interesting systems and stuff like that. That's like one of my Christmases. I get to read the comments and see what people are liking about everything. I think it’s same thing for just about everybody on the team.” </p><p>Like Feasel, all those I spoke to gracefully accepted datamining and its challenges as a sign of a community that loves their games and wants to engage with them. That, they all say, is ultimately a positive. </p><p>“We made something for them,” Cureton says. “We love that the community enjoys finding stuff and we love people working together. So that's all we really care about in the end.” </p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

<div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826253587267436579" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">That’s not handsome jack. That is something far more dangerous and sinister</p>  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826253587267436579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Ever since he first appeared in Borderlands 2, Handsome Jack has arguably been the best antagonist in the loot-and-shoot franchise. Players would eventually kill the egotistical Hyperion CEO by the end of the game, but his legacy would live on with more appearances in future Borderlands adventures. In the Pre-Sequel, players could play as a Jack body-double while helping the real deal out, and in Borderlands 3, one of the DLC expansions was set on Jack's orbital casino and saw players cleaning up a major mess that he'd left behind.</p><p>The most significant Handsome Jack remnant was easily the AI version of the antagonist that appeared in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-from-the-borderlands-a-telltale-game-series/" data-ref-id="5000-404835">Tales from the Borderlands</a>. Depending on your actions, future Atlas CEO Rhys would either keep the EchoEye device containing Jack's digital essence or destroy it, ending his threat for good.</p><p>As for who could be worse than Jack? That remains to be seen, although Pitchford could be attempting to divert attention with his post. Borderlands games have a goofy sense of humor, so for all we know, this could be an elaborate setup to introduce Really Handsome Jack to the series.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>

<p>"But you aren't the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals - a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more - can't wait to step over your corpse and save themselves. Only one of you can make it off the moon - make sure it's you!"</p>

That’s something an evil alien would do. Speaking of evil aliens, the devs also promise you’ll be able to experiment on humans, too. <br></p><p>The devs behind<em> Mars Attracts </em>say it will be out in 2025 on PC and will stay in early access for about a year.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>New gameplay trailer and details.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Eternal Strands [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a></em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,757 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,948 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,017 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in early 2025, developer <a title="Companies > Yellow Brick Games [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/yellow-brick-games">Yellow Brick Games</a> announced. <span id="more-909282"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong><a title="Genres > Action [2,105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>-Packed Gameplay with a Fully Interactive World</strong></p><p>This latest trailer shows that players’ creativity and reactivity will be put to the test as they venture into the Enclave. With the ability to climb everything and interact with almost every facet of the world through temperature and forces, players will need to find innovative ways to maneuver through various environments that have been unpredictably affected by extreme weather events—from a flash freeze hitting the lush forest of Glintwood Hollow, to a heat wave spreading across the imposing architectural ruins of Upper Dynevron. The real challenge of <em>Eternal Strands</em>, however, lies in defeating the nine towering bosses that freely roam the Enclave.</p><p>Once awakened, the newly revealed Epic, the Ark of the Stricken Earth, is a formidable adversary with its kinetic powers. Harvesting strands from these giant enemies will allow players to harness new magical abilities as they advance in their journey. Epics wander freely and change day to day between the various maps, all connected by a central hub: the basecamp. There, players can craft and reforge their gear, weave new powers into their Mantle, or learn more about the realm. Choosing and customizing gear wisely is crucial, but mastering the synergies between steel, frost, flame, and kinetic magic is key to success in battles.</p><p>“We are breaking a lot of traditional conventions and giving the tools to the player to overcome the challenges in front of them however they see fit,” said Yellow Brick Games executive producer and chief operating officer Jeff Skalski. “Take our Ice Wall power for example. Sure, you can cast it to pin enemies in place, but you can also use it to create an ice shield against a drake’s breath or carve an ice path safely through a burning forest. Perhaps one of my favorite uses is while climbing an epic and casting ice on its hands so it can’t grab Brynn thus buying her time for a critical blow. Well, that is until it manages to crush the ice in its hand by using its sheer strength or melt it through other means.”</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_909286"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>The Weaverband</strong></p><p>The trailer also revealed the weaverband—Brynn’s unique skilled basecamp characters. Behind these distinct characters, you will hear the voices of famous actors known for their roles in various games such as <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, <em><a title="Games > Baldur's Gate III [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate III</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Stellar Blade [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a></em>, and TV series such as <em>Wednesday</em> and <em>Sex Education</em>.</p><ul><li>Brynn, the Point (voiced by Mei Mac)</li><li>Oria, the Mentor (voiced by Pandora Colin)</li><li>Sola, the Smith (voiced by Luyanada Unati Lewis-Nyawo)</li><li>Sevastyan, the Smith’s Apprentice (voiced by Kris W. Laudrum)</li><li>Laen, the Lorekeeper (voiced by Robyn Holdaway)</li><li>Casmyn, the Quartermaster (voiced by Rebeccca Hanssen)</li></ul><p>And additional characters and talent to be announced at a later date.</p><p>These fully voice-acted companions, with whom players will be able to forge bonds, will help Brynn gear up for her expeditions and guide her along her journey to uncovering the mysteries of the Enclave, a magical and unpredictable land once a thriving center of magic, now left in ruins. Who knows what might be hiding in these undiscovered lands…</p><p>“We started development on <em>Eternal Strands</em> with a gameplay-first philosophy,” said Yellow Brick Games chief creative officer Mike Laidlaw. “The fantastic world of the Enclave was built with that in mind and gives players a sandbox full of flammable, breakable, launchable, and sometimes-explosive ingredients alongside massive creatures to test our player’s creativity. From that starting point, we put together a fun, <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,691 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>-filled story to tie those experiences together.”</p><p><em>Eternal Strands</em> seamlessly integrates epic battles, a richly woven story, and innovative gameplay, offering a unique experience for those who crave both thrilling combat and engaging storytelling.

The first game was originally released exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016 and was later ported to iOS.

            <p>If you are partial to a freebie (or two), you can currently get your hands on both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> and Gigantic: Rampage Edition over on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The two games are available to claim until 29th August.</p>
<p>After this time, the store will switch up its freebies, and offer interested patrons the ability to claim the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> Classic Collection and Wild Card Football up until 5th September (honestly, where is the year going?!).</p>

<p>The Callisto Protocol came from Striking Distance Studios, which was set up by Dead Space alum Glen Schofield. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-review-a-dead-space-alike-built-on-simpler-pleasures">Eurogamer's Callisto Protocol review</a>, Vikki acknowledged that while "Dead Space comparisons are impossible to avoid", she felt it made up for some of the missing tension "with production value and bloody-minded fun".</p>
<p>Despite this, however, The Callisto Protocol reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to hit sales targets</a>, which caused publisher Krafton's share prices to fall. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">Striking Distance subsequently laid off 32 employees</a> in August last year - a month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">Schofield left the studio</a> "to pursue new opportunities". More recently, Schofield said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-publisher-krafton-insisted-on-releasing-it-too-soon-says-director-glen-schofield">Krafton forced Striking Distance to release the game early</a>.</p>
<p>You can claim this week's free games <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">via this link here</a>.</p>
<p>Next week's Fallout offering, meanwhile, will likely spark some interest following the acclaimed reception of Amazon's TV adaptation. The show's success - which saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in in its first 16 days of release - has already seen droves of players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-fallout-games">venturing into one or many of Fallout's wastelands</a>, to find out what delights were in store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a message posted to X/Twitter, Mateusz Lenart hinted that even that kind of run time would likely not include "the new game plus and all the endings".</p>

<p>He then posted a string of six emojis, all of which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fans will instantly recognise as nods to the game's original six endings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in response to a comment, Lenart teased there would be "no spoilers - not even through emojis" for any of the other secrets the team has planned.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you like to spent your time searching for everything that we put into the game and things we've hidden for you, it will take you more than 20h for sure 👀! I'm not couting the new game plus and all endings of course. I'm curious how fast will you get all of them👽🐕🚸💧🕯👱‍♀️...</p>— Mateusz Lenart (@Mateusz_Lenart_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1825963159695536274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Asked what he was most proud of later in the same X thread, Lenart <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1826005579493736736">said</a>: "I'm proud of everything truly. But if I would need to chose I think the general flow of the game and new level design/puzzles approach. I believe we've been able to find a nice balance between the memory of the original locations and new content that will be able to surprise even the long time fans of SH2."</p>
<p>On Monday (19th August), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-drops-a-new-story-trailer-and-yes-we-finally-get-to-see-eddie">Konami dropped a brand new story trailer for Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, letting us meet Eddie and Mary for the first time.</p>
<p>The teaser essentially matched the original's acclaimed 2001 E3 trailer, and the script is almost identical, too, all set against a fabulous reimagining of (one of) Silent Hill 2's end themes, Promise.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Tom Morgan shared his thoughts on the opening hours of the remake in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.
</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well," Tom wrote in his excellent summary.
</p>
<p>"What I've seen so far of Silent Hill 2 Remake, though, shows a team determined to stick to the original blueprint first. It provides the game a comfortingly familiar structure - while allowing new detail to flourish around it like a trellis - and I'm looking forward to seeing where it grows past its first three hours."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, it looks like that concept has indeed found its intended audience, because now the project is officially called&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>(yes, complete with brackets) and it's set for release across PC and current-gen consoles on October 31st.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redacted-callisto-protocol-roguelike-gunplay.jpg?itok=fDlSSE6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redacted-callisto-protocol-roguelike-gunplay.jpg?itok=JuaSJlUt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>is set to bring&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol</em>-adjacent roguelike thrills this October.</figcaption></figure><p>Each run allows you to experiment with loadouts of different weapons, buffs, and "powerful experiments" as you blast your way through&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/callisto-protocol"><em>The Callisto Protocol</em></a>'s Black Iron Prison.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll gain loot, and you can then use that loot to unlock new permanent weapons and buffs for future runs, and there's even a <i>ZombiU</i>-style mechanic that reanimates your corpse when you die, tasking you with defeating it to unlock a powerful new upgrade.</p>
<p>In a rather unique twist on the formula, at the end of each run, <i>[Redacted]&nbsp;</i>will ask you whether you want to escape or turn back and "risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison". Successfully completing said run will grant you new permanent gear.</p>
<p>All of this is wrapped up in an "irreverent attitude" that's a little less serious than&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, as well as an "arcade-punk soundtrack" composed by&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter&nbsp;</em>soundtrack studio Mutato Muzika.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2229940/REDACTED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007288/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/redacted/9p153bg8qmnq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 31st. If you want to know where it all began,&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently free on the Epic Games Store</a> for a week. Just be aware that you'll need a real beast of a PC to run it well.</p>

What you might not know is that it has a sequel, but it isn’t a movie. In 2007, developer Midway and Woo released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/stranglehold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/stranglehold"><em>Stranglehold</em></a></span>, an action video game that transfers the director’s signature cinematic flair to fascinating gameplay mechanics. Right now you can get it for just $1.99 on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/stranglehold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stranglehold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG</a></span>, and let me tell you, it’s worth it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,196251,196395" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One of the best parts of <em>Hard Boiled</em> is the incredible performance from Chow Yun-fat as the charismatic Inspector Tequila. <em>Stranglehold </em>puts players directly in Tequila’s shoes, with Yun-fat reprising his role. While the plot of the game is much more melodramatic and less tightly paced than the film’s, it’s still a damn good time. There are crime syndicates aplenty, kidnappings, and more bullets getting fired that you can possibly imagine. It’s a pulpy action fever dream worthy of Woo’s name. </p><p>That action is exactly what makes <em>Stranglehold </em>so much fun, as the game works overtime to translate the signature style of Woo’s films into something you can actually play. It plays out as a third-person shooter with some unique flair. If you’ve seen a Woo film, you’ll know that the director has a penchant for incredibly choreographed action scenes with slow-motion, dual-wielded weapons, and—yes—lots of doves flying around.</p><p>One of the best aspects of <em>Stranglehold </em>is its decision to forgo the need to reload the many weapons you will use to take down enemies. Instead you start off with a hefty amount of ammo and run through levels, never needing to worry about resource scarcity. This means you can just run and gun to your heart’s content. And you will do a lot of this considering how many enemies each level is filled with. To emulate the action ballet of Woo’s films, Tequila can also dive around in slow motion—a la <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091"><em>Max Payne</em></a></span>—and fire off rounds with more time to take aim in the air. </p><p>To encourage you to play with cinematic flair yourself, there is also a style mechanic during combat, something you might expect to see more in hack-n-slash games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a></span> rather than a third-person shooter. By taking down enemies, using slow-motion dives, and activating special abilities called Tequila Bombs during combat, you build up stars rating how stylish you’ve been. This all combines to make <em>Stranglehold </em>a frenetic and fun action game with a cinematic twist that puts you in the director’s seat of every scene. For two bucks, it’s an absolute steal worth spending a weekend with. Also, go watch <em>Hard Boiled</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
