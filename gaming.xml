This is according to posts on LinkedIn from recently laid off staff and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails">reporting from <em>Game Developer</em></a> and<em> <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lvl</a></em>. According to reports, employees were notified via emails sent out at 5 AM local time, while the layoffs affect a number of different teams within the the game engine software company. According to <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451/11">a message posted in the Unity forums</a>, one of the casualties in the layoffs was the entire Behavior department which built tools that assisted in NPC scripting. It’s not clear at this point how many employees were impacted.</p><p>Unity has been on shaky ground for the last two years, undergoing several rounds of layoffs amid other upheavals. In January 2024, Unity eliminated 25 percent of its workforce or around 1,800 employees. Before that in November 2023, Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/28/23980250/unity-confirms-layoffs">closed several office locations and cut 265 jobs</a>.</p><p>Before that was one of the events that likely contributed to all the layoffs: the company’s disastrous deployment of its Runtime fee. The fee, which initially intended to charge developers a small fee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">for every download</a> of a Unity game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23872330/unity-developers-react-new-pricing-model">was roundly rejected by prominent indie developers</a>. Several voiced their concerns on social media, while others threatened and, in the case of a collective of mobile developers, actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875396/unity-mobile-developers-ad-monetization-tos-changes">enacted a boycott of the software</a>.</p><div><p>The fallout led to Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update">revamping the runtime fee</a> and resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">CEO John Riccitiello retiring</a> less than a month after the runtime announcement. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Unity for comment.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This new Monk class, or “vocation” as they are called in <em>Tibia</em>, will be focused on melee combat and healing. </p><p>“When the idea first came up, it felt like an impossible task,” explained ClipSoft in a blog announced the Monk. “Adding a new vocation to <em>Tibia </em>after all this time would probably be too complex and too risky. The more we talked about it, however, the more it felt actually possible as well as a natural step for the game. Why else would most bosses allow five characters to enter if not for five different vocations?”</p><p>There’s no specific release date for the Monk class yet, though it will be available to test starting on February 25. ClipSoft plans to release new blogs with more details about the class in the coming weeks.</p><p>“All in all, we see the addition of a new vocation as an opportunity to rekindle the sense of discovery that was always part of <em>Tibia</em>,” said ClipSoft. “A chance to learn the intricacies of a new vocation, experiment with new strategies, and adapt to new team compositions.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More layoffs are happening at Unity. According to a post on its forums by Shanee Nishry, Unity has let go the team working on Unity Behavior along with other staff.</p>



<p>In her post, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nishry says</a> that the entire was included in the latest round of layoffs with support ending immediately. </p>



<p>“Thank you for your love and support for our project,” Nishry said. “Unfortunately we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer.</p>



<p>“I’ve reached out to leadership to ask if they can open source the project, but there is no guarantee.”</p>



<p>Nishry, who has been with Unity for five years, closed saying she wished Behavior could’ve been brought to the finish line. For those unaware, Behavior <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.behavior@1.0/manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was a tool in development</a> for “authoring behaviors used to control non-player characters (NPCs) or objects.”</p>



<p>As far as other teams including in the layoffs, they seem to spread across the company with another senior software developer, Coline Turquin, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294738324894691329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that she was</a> also “part of the recent layoffs”. Other employees have also taken to social media to reveal that they were let go by the company.</p>



<p>As of writing, Unity has yet to make an official statement on the layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Unity for comment and clarification regarding how many people were let go in this latest wave. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In 2024, the company let <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go roughly 1,800 people</a>. Those layoffs cost Unity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-cost-unity-205-million-to-make-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around $205 million</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI </a>and spoke out against the idea that artificial intelligence technologies will surpass the "creative genius" that is only possible from humans. In an interview, Zelnick said the wait for GTA 6 has been so long in part because developer Rockstar Games is seeking "perfection."</p><p>"What Rockstar Games puts into all of their titles is a desire for creative perfection, which is why it takes a long time and why it's complex. We don't claim success until it occurs," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2POQ_toFtgc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p><p>GTA 5 was released all the way back in 2013 and has been released across three generations of console platforms, in addition to PC. In total, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 210 million copies</a>. Zelnick said GTA 5 has been the "standard bearer" at Take-Two and the video game industry overall in terms of sales success.</p><p>"Grand Theft Auto 6? What can I say? There is enormous anticipation inside our company and in the marketplace as a whole. We couldn't be more excited," he said.</p><p>After years of development, GTA 6 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">set for release in Fall 2025 across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Zelnick recently admitted the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">could be delayed</a>, but for now, it remains on track for release this year. Before this, Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">understands that fans are frustrated over the long wait for GTA 6. </a></p><p>As for his comments on AI, Zelnick said Take-Two's teams have been using digital tools since the earliest days of video game development, going on to say that the video game industry is known to be an innovator in this area. He said he expects that to continue with new AI technologies, but he also made it clear that AI cannot replace a human when it comes to creativity.</p><p>"The genius is human. The tools may be digital, but the creative genius is human," he said. "We believe in protecting and paying human beings. We believe we ought to pay for their work if it's replicated by AI after the work is done. We don't think it's the right thing to do to ask someone to perform once, use their work over and over again, and not pay for it. We don't think that's right."</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said artificial intelligence as a term makes no sense because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">machines do not learn--humans do.</a> "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever," he said. "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>In other news, Zelnick recently discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-launch-could-help-improve-console-sales-significantly-take-two-boss-says/1100-6529348/" data-ref-id="1100-6529348">a big game like GTA 6 could help lift console sales. </a></p>

			<p>A new era of online multiplayer PvP battles will be coming on March 4, when War Robots: Frontiers releases and is set to redefine the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">tactical mech warfare genre</a>. For those who want to play this game, it will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One <a href="https://warrobotsfrontiers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for free</a>. To celebrate the announcement of the release date, you can check out the brand new cinematic trailer that was released.</p>
<p><iframe title="War Robots: Frontiers | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWLV7KZFSH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In War Robots: Frontiers, players will get the opportunity to be in the cockpit of their mechs and experience piloting a War Robot. War Robots is already a massive franchise, with over 270 million fans across the globe. War Robots: Frontiers is said to be a huge step for the franchise, a game that has been built from the ground up for both PC and console in Unreal Engine 5. It will be a game that is ideal for those who like competitive play.</p>
<p>Its also been developed to be relatively accurate and authentic, where every step the mech takes will reverberate with authentic weight. Every shot that is fired from your mech will have realistic recoil. Being developed in Unreal Engine 5 means that this game will give players a highly realistic and dynamic battlefield to fight on, where every single move and shot made by the mechs will have realistic movement and help you feel as if you are actually in the mech.</p>
<p>Customization will be a major feature of War Robots: Frontiers, where players can design their mechs in any way they want to, from the chassis, core, weapons, and skill upgrades to create a mech that fits your playstyle and the way you want to tackle combat. By having this much customization, you can choose whether your mech is a huge chunk of steel with firepower, or you can streamline it so that it has agile defenses and the ability to outplay the opponent.</p>
<p>If you're new to the War Robots franchise, this game is aiming to be highly accessible for the newer generations and new players. This includes the ability to play the game by utilizing prebuilt mechs so that you can get used to the look and feel of the game before being overwhelmed by building your own mech. Of course, for those who prefer to build from the ground up, you'll be able to customize it as much as you need to in order to make it battlefield-ready.</p>
<p>The game will also have cross-platform online play, so you can play with your friends on PC and console. There will be multiple game modes available, including ranked modes for those who prefer a dedicated challenge.</p>
<p>War Robots: Frontiers will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 4.</p>

This is according to posts on LinkedIn from recently laid off staff and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails">reporting from <em>Game Developer</em></a> and<em> <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lvl</a></em>.

According to <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451/11">a message posted in the Unity forums</a>, one of the casualties in the layoffs was the entire Behavior department which built tools that assisted in NPC scripting. It’s not clear at this point how many employees were impacted.</p><p>Unity has been on shaky ground for the last two years, undergoing several rounds of layoffs amid other upheavals. In January 2024, Unity eliminated 25 percent of its workforce or around 1,800 employees. Before that in November 2023, Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/28/23980250/unity-confirms-layoffs">closed several office locations and cut 265 jobs</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610165/unity-layoffs-2025-runtime-fee">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTExODI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272699/unity-6-game-engine-release">Unity attempts to turn things around with its latest game engine release</a></h2><div><p><cite>Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Unity hasn’t had the easiest go of things as of late, but as part of its efforts to get back in the good graces of game developers, the company has released Unity 6 globally. In addition to new features like tools that let developers to target mobile web, the game engine maker is also promising that it will dedicate “long-term” resources to “to enhance feature sets and deliver new functionality while maintaining ease of upgrade and continued stability,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241017906915/en/Unity-6-Launches-Globally-Next-Gen-Game-Development-Platform-Delivers-Enhanced-Performance-and-Stability/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-RqSGyeNvWF-qZ8hKEMz48Z5g0wAIXjK73252wRUvTxLWJT50v2g3Ei-19qH0fyPszGrim8IhAkVNXbaI1AGppOzkqEXpa07kut2m9xviGvGKzEpgVj8oZTJfPwAW_-x3g==">according to a press release</a>.</p><p>Unity is a widely-used game development engine powering games like <em>Among Us,</em> <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and many more, but the release of Unity 6 follows a turbulent period in the company’s history. Unity charges developers on a per-user basis, but in September 2023, the company announced a new pricing scheme that charged developers per install of their games after a certain threshold. The change could have potentially added significant costs for developers, and many expressed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23872330/unity-developers-react-new-pricing-model">significant frustrations</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272699/unity-6-game-engine-release">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTYyMjI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing">Unity has eliminated its controversial runtime fee</a></h2><div><p><cite>Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>One year to the day since Unity announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">its runtime fee pricing model</a>, the software developer <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">is canceling that program effective immediately</a>. “After extensive consultation with our games community and customers, we’ve decided to cancel the Runtime Fee,” said Unity CEO Matt Bromberg in the blog post announcing the news. Instead of the runtime fee, Unity will return to a per-seat subscription model.</p><p>Last year, Unity caused a stir within the game development community with a controversial update to its pricing model. Instead of charging developers a set monthly rate based on the number of users utilizing the software, it would implement a pay-per-download scheme that charged developers every time their game was downloaded. That meant instead of paying a flat, predictable rate to Unity, payouts could fluctuate, resulting in potentially higher fees.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjQ1OTQ=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180241/major-nelson-larry-hryb-unity-community-xbox">Major Nelson is joining Unity</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Larry Hryb, aka “Major Nelson,” has his next job.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> features an absolutely dreadful spider monster - a spider that, going by preview encounters and trailers, strives for the point on the Venn diagram between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> and the demon arachnid from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a>. The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw "Lala Barina" out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki's subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.</p><!--more-->

<p>The good news is that the Lala Barina isn't just an absolute bastard spider. It's a teacher. This is the impression given by Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and director Yuya Tokuda, who have been talking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/521156/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-preview">Polygon</a> about the game's newly newcomer-friendly design. "Looking back at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> and Monster Hunter Rise, we focused on where first-time players would drop out from the game," Tsujimoto told the site. "From there, we analyzed that player data and looked into how much we can address - that was our homework for Monster Hunter Wilds."</p>
<p>The fruits of this analysis come across throughout in the addition of handholds like the Seikret, a rideable lizard who'll guide you towards your prey. But they're especially apparent in the game's first few hours, which are sort of one big tutorial. While learning the ropes, you'll tangle with the toadlike Chatacabra, the bovine Doshaguma (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">alas! My beloved</a>), the Brute Wyvern Quematrice, the Rompompolo - a T-Rex crossed with a mosquito - and our lovely friend the Lala Barina. </p>
<p>Should you find these creatures appalling, you may rejoice in the knowledge that they are there to subtly inculcate the basics of Monster Hunting. "At the beginning of the game, you'll first fight Chatacabra, which teaches the players how to avoid big attacks," Tokuda explained to Polygon. "For Quematrice, the next monster that you fight, it uses its long tail. It has a very wide area attack, so it teaches you to dodge. Next is Lala Barina, which uses a lot of tricky movements; it moves out of sight of players, so it teaches them how to control their camera." The Lala Barina harbours other lessons for new players: its many status effects result from a rich diet of forest mushrooms. Perhaps you'll learn about those mushrooms while it's kicking your arse.

</p><p>You know, it all reminds me of how Halo: Combat Evolved taught us the basics of camera control. Halo did it by having a guy hold up a flashlight for you to look at while securely lodged in a cryopod. Seems a bit gentle by comparison. Perhaps Capcom could shore up the association by having the Lala Barina wield some glowsticks. This would also usefully prevent it from using some of its limbs to murder you. </p>
<p>I'm also reminded of Bloodborne, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">which will surely release on PC one of these days</a>: there's a boss in that game, Father Gascoigne, who has a terrifying launch attack that opens with him dragging his blade across the terrain in a cacophony of sparks. That move always used to paralyse me till I realised that the theatrical wind-up exists to teach you how to parry. Yes, this seems closer to the Wilds experience.</p>
<p>I'm writing this article partly because Wilds is making a big deal of tying the simulated ecology into the "gamier" elements, and I really like the idea that certain boss anatomies and behaviours are elaborate pedagogic devices. Perhaps building on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/animal-well-review">my Animal Well review</a> from last year, I think there is much to say about how digital interfaces may become bestial and how beasts may come to resemble HUD elements and how all that connects to older traditions of animal symbolism and heraldry. If you're less enthused about such topics than you are bothered about having to fight a schoolmasterly tarantula, the buried lede, I guess, is that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">Monster Hunter Wilds has an arachophobia mode</a>.</p>

<p>Number one ranked chess player and five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen is reportedly close to joining esports organization Team Liquid. The signing of the consensus best chess player in the world would align with the upcoming debut of chess at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-liquid">Magnus Carlsen in “Advanced Negotiations” with Liquid</h2>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/sources-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-team-liquid/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from Sheep Esports reporter Alejandro “anonimotum” Gomis, Magnus Carlsen is likely to sign a deal with Liquid. Gomis notes in their report that with chess debuting at the Esports World Cup in 2025, Liquid is likely seeking to expand its winnings potential. In the inaugural EWC in 2024, Liquid finished second in the club championship race behind Falcons, taking home $4 million in addition to the prizes won from individual competitions.</p>



<p>To even those only slightly familiar with chess, Carlsen is known as one of the greatest players of all-time, if not the greatest. He’s held the International Chess Federation’s number one ranking since July 2011. He became the first player to hold the Chess, Rapid, and Blitz world championships at the same time in 2014, and then accomplished that feat again two more times. Carlsen most recently made the news after withdrawing from the Rapid and Blitz world championships, after being warned and fined for wearing jeans. He did end up competing in the Blitz tournament after the dress code was loosened, but again sparked controversy after successfully proposing to share the championship after a deadlocked tie with Ian Nepomniachtchi.</p>



<p>Chess isn’t the only game making its debut at the Esports World Cup in the event’s second year. Just yesterday, the EWC announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-world-cup-riot-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT would join</a> Riot Games titles League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2025-games/">at the 2025 tournament</a>.</p>



<p>Is this the biggest name outside of esports to sign with an organization? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2016, Universal and Activision Blizzard brought World of Warcraft to the big screen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-movie-review/1100-6440592/" data-ref-id="1100-6440592">Warcraft</a>. The film only earned $47.4 million in the United States, but its worldwide total was $439.1 million. Regardless, Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, recently shared his belief that Warcraft was not only one of the worst movies he's ever seen, he also cited it as one of the reasons why World of Warcraft veteran designer Chris Metzen left Blizzard in 2016.</p><p>While appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Grit podcast</a>, Kotick explained that Metzen became burned out during the production of the Warcraft movie. Kotick added that he felt it was "a terrible idea" to make the film, but the deal was already in place before Activision merged with Blizzard. He also went on to say that Warcraft proved to be a major distraction for Blizzard that took the company's focus off of the games.</p><p>"It took a lot of resources and distracted [Blizzard]," recalled Kotick. "You think about all these people who make video games for a living and now they have the chance to like make a movie and they're like helping with the casting and they're on the set and it's just a huge distraction. Our expansions were late, you know patches weren't getting done on time and... it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."</p><p>Kotick added that he begged Metzen to return to Blizzard, which he finally did in 2022. Since Metzen's comeback, Kotick noted that they have hardly spoken, before asking rhetorically, "What am I going to tell Chris Metzen about game design?"</p><p>Despite Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it was recently reaffirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-world-of-warcraft-is-not-coming-to-game-pass/1100-6529082/" data-ref-id="1100-6529082">World of Warcraft is not coming to Game Pass</a>. World of Warcraft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024</a>, and there's no end in sight for the game.</p>

<p>The announcement is very, very light on what we might expect to see, but we do know that the show will be around 40 minutes long, and it will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5. The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world.”</p>


<p>And that’s all that they’re saying. Not even hinting at some of the publishers and studios that are taking part. Though we do already know one that will be there:&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-august-release-date-leaks/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater release date announcement</a>, which leaked last week.</p>
<p>The MGS Delta release date trailer – <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4">viewable here</a> – was accidentally uploaded to the PlayStation Store, and the page listing temporarily hosted the game’s August release date as well. The trailer teased the returning Ape Escape tie-in mode, Snake vs. Monkey, just as was found in the original release of Metal Gear Solid 3!</p>

<p>Sony only mentions the PS5 here, and while that strictly speaking would include PSVR 2 games. The VR headset obviously requires a PS5 or a PC in order to play games, so there could be some VR titles featured or games that build VR compatibility in, but Sony don’t mention it here like they have in the past. So, I think we can safely expect that this will be pretty narrowly focused on PS5 titles. Hopefully there’s some first party bangers in there, like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-1-ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/09/insomniac-are-making-a-game-based-on-marvels-wolverine/">Wolverine</a> – which was first announced way, way back in 2021 – or something completely new and surprising.</p>
<p>Maybe Kendrik Lamar will turn up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak&amp;pp=ygUTYXBwbGUgaGFsZnRpbWUgc2hvdw%3D%3D">perform around the PlayStation symbols,</a> like he did on the weekend?</p>

<p>A hacker has found a security flaw in Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular multiplayer games currently available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://shalzuth.com/Blog/IFoundAGameExploit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shalzuth’s blog</a>, spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/528355/article/can-marvel-rivals-hackers-take-over-your-pc-or-playstation-5-remotely-hacker-finds-a-security-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, discusses the Marvel Rivals security exploit, which lets hackers access the player’s PC and PS5. The report states that developers use “remote code execution for their hotfix patching system.” However, when the codes are executed, the “game doesn’t verify” whether the command comes from the real server. Moreover, it provides “admin privileges for the sake of anti-cheat,” making it easier for the hacker to take over the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering about RCE or remote code execution, this is a common way for hackers to run malicious code on a player’s device if they are on an unsecured network without the victim noticing. Shalzuth also posted a video of exploiting this Marvel Rivals security flaw on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSXoH1xYIcE&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gaming laptop</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDxUaIvVxmY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> by injecting malicious scripts while on the same Wi-Fi. He has also contacted NetEase through various channels to inform them about the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security flaws in the gaming industry aren’t uncommon, especially with games like Marvel Rivals, which focus on online gameplay. However, the fact that a hacker can quickly take over a player’s device with the help of the game is a cause for concern, mainly when the title attracts close to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">200-300,000 players every day</a> on Steam alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled mid-season rank resets</a> after recent backlash. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a section on Disney Plus</a>. What are your thoughts on the Marvel Rivals security flaw?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-the-final-preview.1106001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I was smitten with Compulsion’s South of Midnight well before I got to play a little more than an hour of it recently. From the first enigmatic trailers hinting at this Southern gothic, dark fantasy, magical realist stop-motion game set in the Deep South, to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-first-preview-compulsion-games-bets-big-on-art-music-and-deep-south-folklore"><u>IGN’s own first look</u></a>, to the bigger gameplay overview at the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-release-date-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct"><u>Xbox Developer Direct</u></a> – South of Midnight struck me as a deeply moving, highly stylized game that would almost definitely make me cry. When I told the Art Director, Whitney Clayton, that I had immediately thought of that decade-plus-old movie Beasts of the Southern Wild, she confirmed that was one of their early major inspirations for its “Mythical Bayou-type location, folklore creatures, and this really heartwarming protagonist.” That, along with the “darkness and folktale fantasy” of Pan’s Labyrinth from Guillermo del Toro. Huge yes to all of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the section that I got hands-on time with, I absolutely got the sense that all of the intrigue and hype-building was no bluff, and yet a couple elements of the gameplay still needed more time in the metaphorical oven before it’s ready to ship out. Even with those minor blemishes – which are slightly concerning because we’re just a couple months away  from its April 8 release date – I left still enamored with the setting and bubbling with curiosity about the bigger story about ghosts and environmental catastrophe driving South of Midnight. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South of Midnight Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played through Chapter 3, far along enough to have some magical combat tricks as a Weaver going up against spooky figures called Haints – which is exactly where I began. (Though the question of “What exactly is a Weaver?” is yet to be explained.) Diving pretty much headfirst into a fight was expectedly disorienting, but I was reassured that all of the mapped techniques – push, pull, and what’s basically a stun move – are introduced at a pace that’s much easier to get acquainted to naturally. Part of the struggle was the autolock feature being a little loosey-goosey at times; because of the volume of Haints and where they appear in the combat area, the camera spun around the main character, Hazel, in a way that made me a tiny bit woozy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>South of Midnight’s charm is, well, basically everything else besides combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I eventually got the hang of the Weaving moves, plus the timing of dodging for its magic recoil against nearby Haints, and found it challenging enough but not necessarily revolutionary. But I hardly think it needs to be: South of Midnight’s charm is, well, basically everything else. As long as it’s fun (it was) and not horribly repetitive (it wasn’t), then it can, in fact, run almost purely on vibes. From each encounter with the Haints, I felt a sense of eerie dread from the lighting and fog, the blaring drums-and-horns score, the general spore-like creepiness of the Haints and their corruption. And when I finally beat their spooky asses, it culminated in a cathartic cleansing of the land, both physically and spiritually, that had been choking on its past. Hazel wasn’t just clearing out the wreckage of environmental disaster from a devastating hurricane where she lost her mother, setting her on this very journey. She was healing the ghosts of history that were haunting the land, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s kind of how the beats of the chapter went: platform around a swampy area with double jumps, glides, and magic skills to find what I’ll call “Haint holes,” clear ‘em out, and pick up little pieces of a bigger story that all point back to a Mythical Creature – this one in particular at the behest of a giant talking magical Catfish who is both narrator and seemingly Hazel’s mode of transportation around different areas. Chapter 3 didn’t end with a boss battle against one of the giants highlighted in earlier videos; instead I climbed up a giant man-shaped tree to clear the Stigma of its Wound. I swear, the game explains why it exists at all through the collected ghost stories, and houses and spaces are littered with ephemera that help fill out more of the character-building picture. But even so, the ultimate answer still felt like a cliffhanger: Who were these people and how were they connected to the bigger tapestry of South of Midnight? I gotta know!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This storybook narrative meshed peachily – pun intentional – with the luxuriously textured elements of its habitat. Clayton told me the basis of these details was rooted in making the animation feel tactile: “What would this look like if it were actually handcrafted in real life?” she said. “What kind of materials would they have been made out of to look like the thing that they're supposed to be made out of?” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of stop-motion: The team knows that not everyone is going to love the style, Clayton said, and that’s fine: “Anytime you do something a bit bold, you're gonna get polarizing feelings.” (For what it’s worth, if it’s <em>that</em> distracting, you’ll be able to turn it off outside of cutscenes in South of Midnight’s settings.) I will say, I did catch a couple of moments with frame rate issues that haven’t been fully ironed out yet, but Compulsion is aiming for 60fps on Series X by launch. And when everything is running smoothly as it ought to, South of Midnight should be a uniquely beautiful game that might even make you cry a little bit, too.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Having now played the game for about 90 minutes, the gameplay doesn't wow me. That said, South of Midnight doesn't feel like a game that needs to deliver a never-before-seen gameplay experience. The focal point of the game is clearly its celebration of the myths, sounds, culture, and language of the American South, and in that respect, South of Midnight feels like it's going to exceed those expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">You play as Hazel in South of Midnight, desperate to find her mother after their home washes away in a hurricane. Early into her journey, she learns to be a weaver, a person who can both unravel the corrupting forces influencing a community and knit together constructs to glide or leap across dangerous swampland. As Hazel searches for her mom, her abilities and skills as a weaver continue to develop and she comes across numerous legendary monsters, beings who were once humans or animals and have since been twisted into mythical larger-than-life creatures by the trauma and tragedy that surrounded them in life. As a weaver, Hazel's job is to put these legends to rest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441625" data-ratio="0.56842105263158" data-width="1900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441625"></a><figcaption>Hazel can use her weaver abilities to glide, grapple, double jump, and wall-run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My time with the game saw me step in during an early chapter, which immediately precedes the level and boss battle I saw during my trip to Compulsion Games last year. The chapter starts with Hazel having only recently become a weaver and making the acquaintance of Catfish, who promises to help her find her mother if she first frees him from the grip of a colossal tree that resembles a scared and sad-looking man. The level then establishes the gameplay loop that South of Midnight will presumably follow for the rest of the story: Hazel platforms through largely linear levels, encountering and fighting groups of enemies who guard the memories that detail the truth behind a local legend.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not sold on South of Midnight's platforming or combat. Admittedly, this demo made me <em>very </em>motion-sick (I assume it was the stop-motion-inspired animation style, even though stop-motion has never been a problem for me before), so I was a tad cranky by the time I finished up. Still, South of Midnight isn't an especially rewarding gameplay experience. You <em>can </em>mess up the platforming and miss a jump, but the section I played through had their platforms so close together and Hazel is so acrobatic that I never did, with the exception of one early moment when I purposely jumped into the swamp water to see whether Hazel can swim. Spoiler: she cannot. The mistake cost me a portion of Hazel's health, but since there are no enemies to contend with during the platforming sections, this setback didn't create any tension like what's seen in platformers that do something similar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441608" data-ratio="0.56842105263158" data-width="1900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441608"></a><figcaption>Catfish acts as a guide and teacher to Hazel after she saves him.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the chapter I played through felt extremely early into Hazel's adventure, very much like a bike-with-training-wheels section. So the platforming could become more challenging and subsequently more fulfilling to clear later on. From what I've seen so far, however, Hazel's double-jumping, gliding, and wall-running through the bayou doesn't add any excitement to the process of moving from point A to B. The most disappointing part of the demo was a chase sequence right at the end, in which all Hazel had to do was jump back and forth between opposing walls she was running along. There was no floor, and the crescendo in the music curated a sense of tension and suspense, but when all I was doing was jumping back and forth between walls to avoid easy-to-spot gaps, it trivialized what felt like should have been this incredibly suspenseful run for Hazel's life.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also feels somewhat trivial in service to the narrative. As a weaver, I expected Hazel to possess abilities and movements that reflected the act of suturing, knitting, or tearing, an assumption strengthened by Hazel wielding a spindle and weaving hooks as weapons in combat. Instead, Hazel uses her tools more like twin daggers, needing to dodge out of the way of enemy attacks and slash them enough times so that a prompt pops to unweave them, which Hazel does with a cinematic flourish. She possesses some abilities to augment her tools, like a stun and telekinetic shove, that use a cooldown to keep you from spamming them, and a skill tree lets you unlock additional moves for Hazel, like a ground-pound.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441535"></a><figcaption>Sometimes bottling up your feelings takes a literal bottle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Altogether it's fine. South of Midnight certainly doesn't quite reach the acrobatic triumphs of something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunset-overdrive/" data-ref-id="5000-183908">Sunset Overdrive</a>, nor does Hazel have a block or counter (in what I played, at least--maybe she gets one later), which are necessary mechanics for a more strategic and tactile combat experience on par with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hi-fi-rush/" data-ref-id="5000-580957">Hi-Fi Rush</a>. Since Hazel isn't all that nimble during combat, the enemies can't be all that fast and because Hazel cannot block or counter, the enemies' attack patterns can't be all that complex. What's left is a gameplay experience in which you have Hazel dodge out of the way of an enemy's clearly telegraphed attacks, wail on them with melee attacks and abilities, and repeat. Since Hazel typically takes on at least three or four enemies at a time, there's a challenge in needing to keep track of where combatants' placements are, but no enemy I fought had a particular weakness or counter to one of Hazel's moves, so the strategy of wildly slashing worked on everything. And, of course, once you thin the herd a bit and kill one or two enemies, the remaining enemies don't have the numbers to pose a rewarding challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">I get the sense that combat isn't supposed to be all that hard, though, or at least not be a roadblock in the player's path. Each enemy encounter I faced had a pick-up within the combat arena that I could go and interact with to replenish Hazel's health, trivializing each fight further by ensuring I was never close to death.</p><p dir="ltr">The one big exception I could see to this is the boss battles. When Hazel faces these local legends, the encounter can play out in a few different ways. When I went to Compulsion Games' office and saw the chapter that immediately follows this demo, it concluded with Hazel taking on the colossal Two-Toed Tom. It looked incredible, with Hazel facing Tom through multiple phases of increasing difficulty, but I didn't get a chance to play it myself. In the chapter I played for this demo, the "final battle" was climbing a tree along a clearly marked path. It was quite cinematic and the slow build-up of the music made the experience feel suitably epic, but it lacked the gravitas of the Two-Toed Tom boss fight I've seen (as well as the brief look at Huggin' Molly's boss fight during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klgw-To1rqc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight trailer</a> that debuted during 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-directs-are-about-more-than-games-theyre-about-the-human-side-of-game-development/1100-6529023/" data-ref-id="1100-6529023">Xbox Developer Direct</a>). The boss battles could be where the combat mechanics come together in a more fulfilling way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441540" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441540"></a><figcaption>Fighting Two-Toed Tom looks so much fun.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All that said: South of Midnight's art direction, soundtrack, character design, voice acting, and writing seem fantastic, so despite my misgivings with the rest of the game, I want to dive into the full story to see and hear and experience more of its world. Similar to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" data-ref-id="5000-513788">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau/" data-ref-id="5000-612207">Tales of Kenzera: Zua</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-origins/" data-ref-id="5000-465527">Assassin's Creed: Origins</a>, South of Midnight feels like it's going to be an experience long remembered for its setting--the real star of the show. There's clearly been a lot of great care here to not only honor the sights and sounds of the American South, but celebrate the culture and stories told by the people who call the place home.</p><p dir="ltr">Lots of love has been devoted to the additional fantasy elements too, with fun nods to sayings or slang in regards to Hazel's abilities--she uses a bottle to collect the feelings surrounding each legend, for example, in a nod to "bottling up emotions." What I love most, however, is that South of Midnight seems to not be filled to the brim with documents to find, audio recordings to uncover, or NPCs to explain every facet of whatever fantastical scenario is happening to Hazel. So far, the game has allowed me to just exist in its fantasy, fumbling for answers alongside Hazel, maintaining the overall mysticism of the locale and the legends told about the people and creatures who live there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441607" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441607"></a><figcaption>I really hope South of Midnight goes full gothic fantasy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It adds an almost spooky quality to the adventure, framing Hazel as a young woman who has stumbled into something otherworldly that can never be truly understood or explained. What I've played so far has not quite reached gothic fantasy, but I have my fingers crossed that that's where the story is going. Regardless, however, the storytelling and worldbuilding is superb and the voice acting (especially actor Adriyan Rae, who voices Hazel) is remarkably strong, adding a ton of characterization to already memorable character designs.</p><p dir="ltr">I hope this love and care extends to the platforming and combat in the rest of South of Midnight, but even if it doesn't, the game feels like it will at least be an exceptional tale that's set in a very real region of the world that video games (especially in the AAA space) have largely ignored.</p><p dir="ltr">South of Midnight is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Game Pass, and PC on April 8.</p>

                <p>Well, that was fast. Just yesterday, NetEase announced Marvel Rivals was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adding-human-torch-and-the-thing-very-soon-alongside-a-rank-reset/1100-6529366/" data-ref-id="1100-6529366">restructuring its season rankings</a>, but that was quickly reversed.

Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1imd0h8/marvel_rivals_dev_talk_vol10_seasonal_rank/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">immediately responded</a> with

"A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable."</p><p>The update went on to explain how the ranks would work now with the first half of the season still concluding on February 21 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET. Players at Gold rank will receive the costume reward, as well as Crests of Honors for those in Grandmaster and above, and the Crest of Honor for the top 500 (One Above All).</p><p>Now when the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset. Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half. To simplify things even further, to earn more rewards players need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the conditions by the end of the season. Rewards will include a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.</p><p>"We strive to make Marvel Rivals the best game it can be, and the community is the driving force behind this mission," the statement added. "Please stay tuned to our official channels for more updates on the second half of the season. Your engagement and support mean the world to us, and we're excited to continue this journey together!"</p><p>Marvel Rivals will also add Human Torch and the Thing from the Fantastic Four on February 21. The Thing will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard character</a>.

            <p>The Royal Shakespeare Company is working on its first-ever video game, an adaptation of Macbeth - but it doesn't play out as you'd expect.</p>
<p>The game, a collaboration with developer iNK Stories,is called Lili and is set in contemporary Iran. Here, the title character is inspired by Lady Macbeth and played by Cannes Best Actress winner Zar Amir.</p>
<p>As such, iNK Stories is describing the game as a neo-noir "screen-life thriller", combining live-action and interactive storytelling, and is influenced by Amir's experiences as an Iranian woman in exile battling authoritarian gendered oppression.</p>
<p>"We're really calling this genre a 'screen-life thriller', with the idea that all of this is transpiring on your desktop," iNK Stories co-founder Navid Khonsari tells Eurogamer. "The real focus for that is we want to embrace a large audience, people that naturally might not see themselves as wanting to play games."</p>
<p>Khonsari previously worked at GTA developer Rockstar as cinematic director on GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas, as well as the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> games. After leaving the company he co-founded iNK Stories with his wife Vassiliki Khonsari and together they gained notoriety for their previous BAFTA-nominated game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/1979-revolution-review">1979 Revolution: Black Friday</a> set in the Iranian Revolution.</p>
<p>Now they're working with the RSC on Lili, which was a suggestion from the company's director of digital Sarah Ellis, who was familiar with iNK Stories' work. "For us it became pretty clear that it would be abundantly thrilling to turn Macbeth, this timeless tale, into a game," Vassiliki says.</p>
<p>"Obviously all of Shakespeare's stories have transcended both time and culture, being adapted in multiple different ways... but not in this form," adds Navid. "For us, the challenge of it and the adaptation of it and making something interactive, putting the audience at the centre of this incredible story that has so many climactic moments and allow you to be in the middle of that rather than being somebody that's just observing it, was not just a great challenge, but also what a great story!</p>
<p>"It's made for that kind of player who likes to explore and really live in that world," he continues. "As we know, Shakespearean text is so rich: the backstories, the history, the evolution of each character. It was such rich material to be able to draw from."</p>

<p>The studio worked with dramaturges to bring Shakespeare's play to life in a new setting, with help in particular from RSC board member and leading Shakespeare academic Emma Smith. It's been a collaborative effort, with Navid describing a "continual conversation and collaboration" with the RSC to be able to push the boundaries of the play.</p>
<p>So how exactly will Lili play? Players will take the role of a hacker, initially tasked with befriending Lili, but to do so means infiltrating her hardware, using the dark web and government surveillance to follow and watch her. This takes place through live-action sequences to maintain the theatricality of the original play. Later, players will use these same tools to take down the regime that's oppressed Lili, though the pair noted the game's moral ambiguity - while it loosely follows the events of Macbeth, players can still impact the narrative.</p>
<p>Macbeth has a legacy of being an "enigmatic character", says Vassiliki, with Lady Macbeth as "both a heroine and a villainess and wildly complicated". She continues: "Through the lens of 400 years, who is this woman with this thirst and ambition? How do we unpack her today?"</p>
<p>As such, Macbeth provided an "interesting entry point to touch on today's culture points" and a "perfect moment" of combining Shakespeare's play with modern day Iran. "There was a lot of electricity when we started thinking about bringing Macbeth to Iran and what are the parallels in the morality police in which we're placing this military hierarchy of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth and adapting that too," says Vassiliki.</p>
<blockquote>"There was a lot of electricity when we started thinking about bringing Macbeth to Iran."</blockquote>
<p>"When we first started looking at the story and initially digging in, there's something extremely strong and attractive about [Lady Macbeth] but we realised because of her gender, she was limited," says Navid. "The question of gender is something that's becoming globally challenging right now, not just within Iran. So we wanted to not just scratch that, but to then recognise this is obviously the huge thing that's impacting women, specifically in Iran."</p>
<p>Macbeth's infamous witches also became an entry point for the game's parallels with the play. While the team had begun development before 2022's protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini - a woman who died due to injuries sustained while in police custody - these circumstances added to the game's pertinence. "All of a sudden the country was going into this technological lockdown and the flow of information was being governed by the regime and at the same time there were hackers and people at the forefront of trying to allow information to leave Iran, but also allow people to organise within," explains Vassiliki. "That, for us, became this really beautiful parallel of the witches and Macbeth. They control the flow of information and within our world they're the forecasters of chaos. They're agents of destabilisation. They're both supernatural and sort of digital in their omnipresence."</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Through making the game, the pair say they have considered the intersection between theatre and games. "Theatre, as it unfolds in a live setting, there is an interplay between the audience and the performance," says Vassiliki. "Particularly during Shakespearean times... that open forum of back and forth took place. And that's actually like games in that it's all happening and unfolding in a live way whereby the player has agency, the audience has agency within that world - unlike film. What was really fascinating was working with the dramaturges, working with the Shakespearean experts, and really mining for the places where there is immersion and there is room for interpretation."</p>
<p>Ultimately, all this means Lili will be quite different to what is generally expected from Macbeth, but Navid noted the core of the story remains underneath. "We make games for global audiences and sometimes if we become too literal to the text, we feel like we'd actually be pushing our audience away," he says. "We wanted to draw them in by staying true to the material, by the themes of the material, but also make it digestible in a way and global in a way that language doesn't become a barrier for people wanting to play the game."</p>
<p>Adds Vassiliki: "It's very important to us to preserve the thematic strength of these stories. They've endured for so long for a reason. How do we make sure we're honouring that? That's been part of the relationship with the RSC in not just going hogwild with off-the-wall interpretations, but actually allowing these interpretations to further enrich the original text."</p>
<blockquote>"Forget the old chestnut that Shakespeare would be writing for Hollywood if he were alive now: what Lili makes absolutely clear is - he'd be writing for gaming."</blockquote>
<p>Really, Lili is proving the timelessness and universality of Shakespeare's plays. As Emma Smith said, as quoted in a press release for the game: "Forget the old chestnut that Shakespeare would be writing for Hollywood if he were alive now: what Lili makes absolutely clear is - he'd be writing for gaming."</p>
<p>Vassiliki extends this idea. "The linearity of traditional films don't capture the richness of the worlds [Shakespeare] created and the characters," she said. "I think games absolutely can do that, the fact they're non-linear and you can provide this canvas that allows for exploration and interaction and agency, it's so much more complicated and complex."</p>
<p>She adds: "Games are the contemporary zeitgeist of today's culture... you can see that we gravitate towards this medium because it affords us agency, it affords us a place where we can fully invest in a world and make choices as ourselves and see the consequences of how that unfolds."</p>
<p>Lili is still in development and is due for release later this year. It follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">release of Grand Theft Hamlet</a>, a documentary film about staging Shakespeare inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, this could be the start of a Shakespearean renaissance in video games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/blade-soul-neo-a-remaster-of-the-classic-mmorpg-is-coming-soon-to-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade &amp; Soul NEO</a>&nbsp;<span>will be released on February 25, and we were recently given the opportunity to interview NC America's Andrew Long, Senior Producer, and Andrew Gant, Community Manager, about the upcoming release and what players can expect from the MMORPG&nbsp;Blade &amp; Soul Live will </span>continue to exist at the same time, with updates being released for that title alongside this new and improved version of the game.</p>
<p>Before the interview, I was given an exclusive look at the game in a presentation. This presentation showed off the expansive customization available, where you can tweak characters in any way you can imagine to make them fully yours.</p>
<p>When the game launches, it will be launching with seven of the 14 classes that are currently available in Blade &amp; Soul Live. As you explore the game, there will be many different outfits that you can collect to keep your character fashionable while facing off against bosses or other players in PvP. Additionally, those who purchase the exclusive <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/news/article/14645/bns-neo-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order bundles</a> will also get some special outfits and cosmetics. The graphics are revamped, giving the game a fresh coat of paint. As the developers stated, the story will be the beloved Blade &amp; Soul story that you know and love, with some extra improvements made along the way.</p>
<p>In the interview, I made sure to ask some of the burning questions that the dedicated community had, as well as get some answers to questions of my own.</p>
<p><strong>What went into the decision to remake Blade &amp; Soul now rather than earlier or later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> A lot of us have this nostalgia where we feel like when the game launched in our time frame, it was the best it's ever been, and so, we really wanted to relive that experience and address it with new audiences, there's a whole new generation of people who weren't even born yet, or old enough to play video games at the time Blade &amp; Soul launched. We want to have that interaction between the old and the new, playing all together in that experience.</p>
<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO is adding a lot of features to make the game friendlier for new audiences, including the addition of infinite Windwalking. Prior to this, you had an allotted amount of Windwalking that you could do before you ran out of stamina. Now, you can Windwalk as much as you like, which will allow you to scale new buildings, take pictures in new locations that you would have never been able to reach in the previous version of the game, and much more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bs_neo_character_creation.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Will there be ranked systems for PvP or PvE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> When our 6v6 battlegrounds come out, we'll have the awards attached to those. At the time of launch, there's not going to be any of those systems in the game. But, the battleground 6v6 arena does come very quickly after the launch. We want to monitor how people are going to take the launch, and we're going to enjoy that content, and when we see people getting towards the end of it, we have that content ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to add new classes that didn't exist in the original?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> As far as classes go, in Live we're up to 14 classes. We want to introduce those into NEO as well. We don't have a timeline exactly... As far as new classes, it's something we're going to look into; I don't have anything to share at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any stories or expansions added to NEO that won't be added to Live and vice versa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I don't want to spoil anything, but that is definitely something we want to do.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bs_neo_boss_battle.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>What is your favorite part of NEO compared to Live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> It comes down to what kind of MMO gamer you are, I love adventure and exploration. I'll probably be gobbling up the infinite Windwalking and exploring every single section of the map, looking for hidden places, and probably trying to get my friends to climb a building that you've never been able to get to the top of just to take pictures. I love the new aspects and exploration journal that we've added, these little hidden unlockables that you can find from exploring the world.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I'm really excited, we've changed how the gear drops in Blade &amp; Soul NEO. In Live, you get all of your weapons and accessories at a base level, and the base level is all the same. You go through a zero to 20 upgrade system, and it's very harsh. I'm not a big fan of that system, personally. What we've done in NEO is more of a traditional style. We've really upped the drop rates of thing,s and the secondary stats are going to be randomized. You're going to be able to get a lot more gear... I'm really excited that I'm not going to have to run a dungeon a thousand times before I even see a piece of gear that is what I want.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any plans for controller compatibility down the line?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> Currently, we don't have controller compatibility at the moment. We are going to be looking at other platforms, whether it's going to be console or Steam. We're definitely looking at that right now. At the time of launch, we will not have controller support available.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> I know we have DLSS available, but I'm not sure about the other. There are an incredible amount of customizations you can do so that your machine can run NEO just fine. The recommended specifications are very similar, if not the same, as the ones for Blade &amp; Soul Live.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
<p>The team behind Blade &amp; Soul NEO has a lot planned to ensure that the game is friendly and accessible to new audiences. This includes completely optional PvP, gathering systems, and plenty of gear to unlock. The story will be authentically Blade &amp; Soul, with the improved visuals bringing a fresh lick of paint to a game that is beloved by its community. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will be available for <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/neo/trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free on PC</a> on February 25 in North America and Europe.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-studio-krafton-reports-record-breaking-sales-and-profits-in-2024.1105965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has released its financial statement for the 2024 fiscal year, and the company has reported "record-breaking" sales and profits.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Krafton's sales grew by 41.8% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, while its profits grew by a staggering 54%. Both of these figures were, Krafton says, "driven by the continued expansion and sustainability of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP".</p>

<p>The figures mean that Krafton's average annual sales growth rate for the past five years stands at 20%, which isn't too shabby at all. I'm sure the studio will be happy with these numbers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=EiCaq-fE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=HTOeUEbU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP has driven a year of record-breaking highs for Krafton in financial terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton also reported its numbers for the year's fourth quarter along with the full twelve-month span, and that quarter also brought growth for the company, with sales rising 15.5% and profit rising 31.1% year-on-year.</p>

<p>According to Krafton,&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s transition to a free-to-play model, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-player-count-doubles-on-steam-after-free-to-play-launch" rel="nofollow">took place in late 2021</a>, "has continued to drive growth", along with the IP's various successful collaborations. As a reminder, those collaborations have historically included the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">Payday</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-crossover-adds-dead-by-daylight-for-spooky-frights" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>With regards to its future, Krafton says it wants to make "significant investments in securing a 'Big Franchise IP'", although it's not clear whether that means the company wants to acquire a new property or transform its&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP into a "Big Franchise".</p>

<p>The company's slate of games for this year includes the likes of survival sequel&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow">Subnautica 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>inZoi</em></a>, as well as the global launch of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker Mobile&nbsp;</em>and multiplayer life sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum Together</em>.</p>

Not only does the company have a packed slate of upcoming games, but it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks</a> and the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP after Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">turned its back on the studio</a>.</p>

<p>Krafton is also planning to develop a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of global smash hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, although we don't have a release window for that yet. Hopefully, that won't have the rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">nightmarish-sounding AI-generated player characters</a> the studio is currently going all-in on.</p>

While <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the follow-up to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Death Stranding 2</em> are both due for release later in the year, questions remain about the state of multiplayer shooter <em>Fairgame$</em> and other Sony projects like Insomniac Games’ <em>Wolverine</em>. </p><p>It’s also possible that this week’s State of Play could include the announcement of a <em>God of War</em> anthology that brings the older PS2 and PS3 games to the PS5. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user Feeling-Examination6</a></span>, who previously leaked the existence of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, has added to the mounting pile of rumors that the <em>God of War </em>Greek saga is getting a modern re-release. Currently, of the games that preceded 2018's relaunch of the franchise, only <em>God of War III</em> has a version playable on PS5. </p><p>What’s less clear is which other games this rumored collection would feature. In addition to the numbered entries, there’s also <em>Chains of Olympus</em> and <em>Ghost of Sparta </em>for the PSP, as well as <em>God of War: Ascension</em>, the final game before the series went dark until 2018 brought the franchise into Norse mythology. What seems more certain is that if these games really are getting modern ports, they’ll likely  end up on PC as well at some point. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Split Fiction is the spiritual successor to It Takes Two, and people are hyped. Hazelight Studios has cracked the co-op formula, and Split Fiction’s release can’t come soon enough for those seeking a tandem adventure.</p>



<p>I constantly advocate gaming needing more co-op games. The genre isn’t as dead as people think it is has plenty of titles supporting local and online co-op. You need to check the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest co-op games coming in 2025</a> to see this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is likely to be the standard-bearer for the genre moving forward.</p>



<p>Director Josef Fares looks to keep the art of co-op alive and further the genre wherever possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-release-date">Split Fiction Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The dynamic duo. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hazelight Studios is launching Split Fiction on March 6.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> hosted an incredible ceremony celebrating all things gaming. Amongst the awards were a large volume of game announcements and trailers. Hazelight Studios director Josef Fares announced the much-anticipated follow-up to It Takes Two—<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have any Early Access or ways to sample the action early. You and I have to wait patiently until March 6 to see what new ideas and innovations come up.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-platforms">Split Fiction Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a pure next-gen launch for Split Fiction debuting on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>I’m shocked Split Fiction is skipping last-gen formats, to be honest. It Takes Two launched on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC at launch—offering a Switch port one year later.</p>



<p>Whereas Split Fiction is sticking to the most recent generation, and that’s it. I’d argue a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release could happen in the future. Nintendo’s newest console is rumored to be a lot more powerful, so don’t be surprised if the Switch 2 eventually gives Split Fiction a new lease of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-editions-amp-price">Split Fiction Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has an established recommended retail price of $49.99 or £39.99 for the Standard Editon—the only version of Split Fiction.</strong></p>



<p>Physical and digital editions of Split Fiction exist. An interesting note is the Standard Edition is the <strong>only way to play Split Fiction</strong>. There is no Deluxe Edition, Unbelievable Mega Ultra Deluxe Edition, or a Collector’s Edition. This is good news for players unwilling or unable to splash out on constant expensive upgrades.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve a huge fan of Hazelight Studios from the A Way Out days. How much are you looking forward to Split Fiction? Does EA have another bonafide success on its hands?</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction gameplay</a> to wet your whistle in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Fallout made its bright and bloody TV debut last year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">critically-acclaimed first season</a> which not only drew in viewers but also led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's video game wastelands. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">Fallout 4 actually became the best-selling game in Europe</a> at one point in April, despite already being several years old.</p>
<p>It came as no surprise, then, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">Amazon series was picked up for a second season</a>, with showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner later stating the team was "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible".</p>
<p>And now, Fallout's Ghoul Walton Goggins has provided us all with a little update on the upcoming season, promising that while season one was certainly good, the next one is going to be even better.</p>

<p>"We're in the middle of filming it right now, we've been at it since November, and I can tell you that I thought Season one was extraordinary, personally, I was very pleased with it," Goggins said to Deadline when asked about Fallout's second season.</p>
<p>"This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story. It's really gonna be something. I can't wait for people to see it.</p>
<p>"We're working really hard to make that happen."</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin has reportedly joined Fallout's second season cast</a> in a recurring role. Further details on his part remain slim for now, however Culkin is said to be playing "a crazy genius-type character" when the show's new episodes roll around.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, devastating wildfires raged across multiple districts of Los Angeles, shutting down production across Hollywood and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">impacting the filming of Fallout's second season</a> along with a swathe of other projects.</p>
<p>Following these fires, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-donation-to-los-angeles-wildfire-relief">number of companies announced donations to help with relief</a> and rebuilding efforts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
