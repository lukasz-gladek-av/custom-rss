"There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off, you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest. All these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. Or now you could change the body size significantly. The character creator had evolved quite a bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans lamented that Starfield, which was the first full single-player role-playing game from Bethesda in eight years, didn't have the gore and dismemberment mechanics that were present in Fallout 4. Mejillones said these mechanics make more sense in Fallout than in Starfield, however, given their "tongue in cheek" humor. "It's part of the fun," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield arrived in September 2023 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-hits-15-million-players-as-patch-adds-achievement-friendly-creations-new-land-vehicle-and-quest-and-more">in the time since has reached more than 15 million players</a>. "Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, another former Bethesda developer revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with">his surprise at the sheer amount of loading Starfield ended up launching with</a>, particularly in the city of Neon. Since launch, Bethesda has worked to improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">with 60fps now possible as part of performance mode</a>. Expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield-shattered-space">Shattered Space</a> launched in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

But one high-schooler has managed to port Doom into an actual PDF file that you can run inside your browser. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, it’s missing minor elements like “text” and “sound” — but who really needs that when you can play E1M1 while pretending to do those taxes you’ve been ignoring?  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Github user and “high school student” <a href="https://github.com/ading2210" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ading2210</u></a> was inspired by a recent port of Tetris, named TetrisPDF, to the humble PDF format, and resolved to make one of the world’s most celebrated shooters playable in a Chromium-based browser near you. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/screenshot-2025-01-14-171016-1736874646161.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doom in a PDF?

While the official specifications for a PDF allow for more sophisticated scripting, security concerns in browsers cut things down a bit. But it was enough to still port Doom over to the format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Javascript capabilities within the PDF specifications allowed ading2210 to “do whatever computation we want,” and the results are glorious. Using a six-color ASCII grid to represent sprites and graphics, the high-schooler managed to deliver a legible port of Doom, so long as you’re happy with a lengthy response time of 80ms per frame drawn on screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might not want to throw out your PS5 just yet, but seeing Doom ported to the inside of a .PDF file is pretty remarkable, especially considering just how legible the overall result is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TetrisPDF creator Thomas Rinsma <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680801" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted on Hacker News</u></a> that he had also made his own version of PDF Doom, but added that ading2210’s version was “neater in many ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you might not want this version of Doom to be the way you first experience the game, the novelty of seeing Doom run on all kinds of ridiculous devices, files (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DnoOOgYxck" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>or even living gut bacteria</u></a>) is endlessly entertaining.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Director David F. Sandberg also explained the premise: teenagers are stuck in a time loop where each cycle is a different horror genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The movie, it has sort of the same tone and the same vibe but it expands upon the universe," he said. "One of the creative things the game did is that people make different choices and die in different ways. The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again. Every time they come back to life it's like they're in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">Sony Pictures already revealed the film will feature a new story and cast of characters</a>, it's now clear it's taking a more meta approach rather than just telling a traditional horror story as the video game did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until Dawn, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-review">which arrived in 2015 and became a quick fan favorite</a>, lets players make pivotal decisions in a story where all eight teens can die, all eight can live, or anywhere in between. Its story also brought in elements of different horror genres, with villains shifting from a creepy man in the woods to a clown mask-wearing killer to full on spooky monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Until Dawn film will seemingly focus on these elements instead of expanding the stories of Sam, Josh, and so on, or telling the tale of new teenagers struggling through a similar night. The characters in the film will have to make different decisions, like the players of the game, and progress through different genres as they go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actor Peter Stormare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-will-see-dr-hills-video-game-actor-reprise-his-role">who played Doctor Hill in the original game</a>, and as we now know, another character also called Hill in the film, said earlier in January that this approach works for dedicated fans and newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Nintendo is reportedly set to announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on January 16, and Walmart Canada--known for upsetting video game developers by leaking announcements early--has chimed in with a meme of its own.</p><p>Today, January 14, the Walmart Canada Gaming account posted the popular image of Mario peeking from behind a curtain. "Hey, Mario," the post said, with the waving-hand emoji. Walmart Canada is no doubt referencing the rumors of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">forthcoming Switch 2 reveal</a>.</p><p>What's noteworthy here is that Walmart Canada has a semi-lengthy history of spoiling major announcements by posting product pages ahead of official announcements. As of yet, however, Walmart Canada hasn't spoiled anything about the Switch 2.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/788900063833493504" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Mario curtain image dates back to 2016</a>, when Nintendo of America used it to promote the announcement of the Switch, which was then known as "NX." It was meant to suggest that Nintendo would soon pull back the curtain on the device. It quickly became a meme, and some thought it was kind of creepy. Former Nintendo staffers later discussed how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-former-staff-say-infamously-weird-mario-curtain-photo-wont-happen-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo was aware of the reaction</a> and would never do something like that again.</p><p>Walmart Canada's leaks have included the first reveal of Rage 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-vp-pete-hines-drags-walmart-canad/1100-6459642/" data-ref-id="1100-6459642">prompting Bethesda to drag the retailer in comments during E3 2018.</a> Also in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-reacts-to-rage-2-possibly-being-leaked-be/1100-6458836/" data-ref-id="1100-6458836">Walmart Canada leaked Borderlands 3, Gears 5, Just Cause 4, and other titles</a>.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming account is run by Riley Little. He <a href="https://www.walmartcanada.ca/news/2022/11/16/gamers-united-the-success-story-of-walmart-canada-gamings-twitter-account#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20Walmart%20was%20a%20person,more%20than%20three%20years%20ago." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a blog post in 2022</a> that it came down from above that Walmart Canada could do a better job communicating to gamers, and it was his idea to make the account "more approachable and more interesting." To achieve this, Little started posting all kinds of memes, as well as straight news and product announcements to drive people to shop at Walmart.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming leaks, though, have slowed down significantly in recent years. After all, video game developers and publishers generally do not enjoy having their unannounced information emerge early. As such, it would be shocking to see Walmart Canada actually reveal anything legitimate about the Switch 2, though you never know. Outside of Walmart Canada, the internet has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-breaks-its-silence-on-recent-switch-2-leaks/1100-6528735/" data-ref-id="1100-6528735">full of Switch leaks</a>. </p><p>If the rumors prove to be accurate, Nintendo could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">announce the Switch 2 on Thursday, January 16</a>, with the console then going on sale in May or June.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Sims is turning 25 this year, and EA has announced that a trio of new Kits are scheduled to hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> later this week to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The news was announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk">a livestreamed</a> episode of Behind The Sims, which was posted to the official Sims YouTube channel. The stream featured a number of well-known "Simmers": players who stream their Sims 4 gameplay on Twitch or YouTube. In fact, one of the upcoming Kits was created in collaboration with LilSimsie, a popular Sims 4 content creator known for her elaborate house builds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FryVzV0aJdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for the Kits, their official titles haven't yet been announced, but we do know when they're arriving: All three Kits will be available for purchase on January 16, and although their price has yet to be confirmed, Sims 4 Kits normally cost $5 USD, so it's likely that players will be able to get their hands on all three of the new Kits for a total of $15.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the actual content included in these Kits, EA was a little more forthcoming.</p><p dir="ltr">"Two of the Kits are a mixture of Build/Buy [Mode items] and Create-A-Sim items inspired by Sims icons," LilSimsie shared during the livestream. "And the last one? Well, that one was made in collaboration with me!"</p><p dir="ltr">Given LilSimsie's well-known love for creating extravagant lots in Build Mode, it's likely that the Kit she collaborated on will include a good number of new items for players to build in-game homes with.</p><p dir="ltr">But these mysterious new Kits aren't the only thing players have to look forward to: According to the schedule shared in the livestream, the game's main menu is getting a total UI revamp, which has already gone live. Additionally, EA has announced that the MySims: Cozy Bundle will come to PC on March 18 (currently, it's only available to play on Nintendo Switch). Lastly, The Sims FreePlay will get a new update on February 4 that pays homage to the era in which the game first launched back in 2000.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Sims FreePlay has an exciting update planned!" EA shared. "Starting February 4, we're taking you back to the 2000s, where The Sims all began. Participate in special events, unlock velour tracksuits, and enjoy 25 days of in-game gifts featuring some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history!"</p><p dir="ltr">For more information on the new Sims 4 Kits, the MySims: Cozy Bundle, and The Sims FreePlay update, check out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's recent blog post</a>.</p>

Players help their character reconnect with their lost heritage and discover what it truly means to be Na'vi.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pandora is a rich world containing thousands of different plants, animals and insects. I had the opportunity to create the sound for some of these. In this article, we will analyze two specific examples: The Lift Vine and the Veilswarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Lift Vine">The Lift Vine</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Audio direction">Audio direction</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Lift Vine blurs the line between plant and animal. It’s what the Avatar universe calls “zooplantae” – they may look like exotic plants, but can have surprising, fun interactive behaviors. They might retract when you get close to them (as seen with the “Helicoradian” in the Avatar movie), electrocute you while you’re exploring the world, or in the case of the Lift Vine: pull you up a ledge when you grab onto them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some parts of the Lift Vine look like an animal and other parts look like a plant. For example, the tail of the vine looks very much like a reptilian or bird claw, while the top looks like a plant with leaves and branches. We wanted to emphasize both elements by creating organic sound textures, to make it feel grounded and believable, and fit in with the rest of the natural soundscape in the game world. However since they have gameplay functionality, we also made sure they have high transients to make it easily audible for the player, in the busy mix of sounds in the rainforest. The Lift Vine also has several versions with gameplay variations that we will explain later. As it is found very frequently in the game, in every part of the open world, the sound couldn’t be too invasive, repetitive or loud. We wanted the sound to be somewhat appealing and attractive for the player to invite them to use the Lift Vine.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h4><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Allows the player to go up or down ledges when they grab the vine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vine isn’t available in polluted environment.

I recorded various props, such as a leather belt, jacket, deflated balloon, various vegetables, etc. and processed it in Reaper.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Lift Vine in Wwise. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The source sounds are implemented in Audiokinetic Wwise, using random containers with sound variations. We paid a lot of attention to detail in the implementation. Each part of the Lift Vine was to have its own bespoke, carefully positioned sound, not only when the player uses it but also when it is static in the open world. For example, when the Lift Vine isn’t used, we can see the vine or the claw slightly moving. The leaves in the vegetal platform on top of it are also gently moving according to the current wind strength in the world. All these little things deserved a sound.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6N1H28AO0tA?si=O8bLoMRc6FgwlGlm" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s look at all those components in detail, starting with the vine. The vine sound is made of leathery and creaky textures. I remember in the recording room, twisting an old big rope in every possible direction to have as many variations as possible, which was a lot of fun. Two audio emitters are positioned along the vine and the distance from each other varies according to the vine length.</span></p><p>Left, a vine. Middle, 15 meters vine length and right, 30 meters vine length. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vine length can be just a few meters long, or up to 30 meters. The audio emitter position changes according to this length so they stick to the vine. This emitter position variation is scripted in the Lift Vine’s graph in Snowdrop, our proprietary game engine. We calculate the real time vine length by subtracting the Y axis float world position of the head to the tail Y axis float world position. Then we divide the difference by a constant. The quotient is then added with the Y axis of the tail world position and the sum is the Y axis of the audio emitter.</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em-pgrW5ehg?si=d7_uQARWaWQS7H5A" height="450px" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" loading="lazy" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These vine creak sounds stop playing when the area in which it is placed, has been polluted by the human antagonists in the game. When it’s polluted, visually, the vine disappears, the bulb and the vegetal platform turn grey and look sickly. We use the audio emitter position and check its pollution value at runtime. When it’s above a certain value, we set a Boolean to false, preventing the audio from playing.</span></p><p>How we dynamically change the audio emitter position based on the vine length in Snowdrop.

Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The claw idle sound, when it’s static and already opened, is made of rope creaks and gravel friction to get a "clicky" organic sound. It gives the claw a sort of animal texture. We didn’t want it to sound too vegetal because it looks very much like a monster claw. So, this part had to sound different than the rest of the plant. Also, as mentioned before, these high transient clicky sounds are made to attract the player’s attention.</span></p><p>Lift Vine claw. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNoZl1jXDAk?si=yGOy3eNTWZz33aGW" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The upper part of the Lift Vine contains the bulb and the vegetal platform. Sometimes, the bulb hosts the vine inside it (one of the gameplay variations). Visually, when it does, we can see that the bulb is very big and round, inflated. The bulb idle sound remains very organic but emphasizes the fact that it contains something inside. It also plays only when players use their “Na’vi senses” to listen, but we will talk about that later.</span></p><p>Inflated bulb containing the vine inside it. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this case, the player must shoot at the bulb to release the vine. We trigger a bulb burst and vine release sound with organic vibes when it’s destroyed. We wanted the bulb burst to be puffy, grainy, almost smoky, to fit with the big brown seed cloud VFX release. The vine being released needed to sound a bit wet, liquid as we imagined that the inside of the bulb theoretically contained some sort of lifeblood even if we don’t see it. We extrapolated the sound from the visual to give even more life to the plant.</span></p><p>Bulb Explosion.

We made a specific one-shot sound for the plant retracting with the same vegetal and organic vibes.</span></p><p>Plant to interact with.

The idea is to mimic something we’ve all experienced in the real world: the low, fluttering sound of air buffeting on our ears when there is a lot of wind or fast movement. It’s one of the ways in which we try to take advantage of the game’s first person perspective, to make the player feel like they’re really there—more immersed in the world and connected to their character. This sound is in 2D, meaning it moves with the player’s position rather than being placed in the world. Therefore we need to manually switch between a stereo and a 4-channel (quad) version, depending on whether the player is using a surround sound system.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0eDidAD5GI?si=_Sq-tWZ3DVOB00EO" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p>In ear sound configuration in Wwise. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having the 2D in-ear wind sound emitter attached to the player created a complication. In coop mode, we didn’t want this sound to trigger when the player’s teammate uses the Lift Vine because it wouldn’t make sense for the local player to hear this extreme proximity sound, when a remote player uses the Lift Vine.</span></p><p>Snowdrop node. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do that, we set a condition with a Boolean when the agent using the Lift Vine is the local player or a player from the server. This was just one of many considerations that needed to be made to ensure the coop experience works for both players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As promised earlier, let’s talk about the player character’s “Na’vi Senses”. Basically, the player can go into a “super focused mode” by pressing a button on the controller, and it helps guide them through the game. It highlights important things visually and sonically and enables the player to find relevant information. (In early production, this feature was called Master Hunter Senses, which is why you can see the abbreviation MHS in these screenshots).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Wwise switch container. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Na’vi Senses are active, and the bulb is big and round so the vine is inside it and not available, we trigger an extra layer of organic and clicky looping sounds in the bulb. We also do some dynamic mixing with azimuth and elevation RTPCs so it gets more audible when the player is looking directly at it. All these things are very subtle on their own. But when put together, they can guide the player towards the Lift Vine in the dense and busy open world, without becoming overbearing.</span></p><p>Na’vi Senses activated to guide the player.

So, we needed some “foley” sounds to cover the characters hands interacting with the zooplantae. To make sure the sound matches what the player sees on screen, we not only had to work on the Lift Vine graph object but also in the player animation system to implement these little sounds.</span></p><p>Wwise implementation for player grabbing the vine sound. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p>Audio integration in Snowdrop animation system. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Working on the Lift Vine was very interesting as it’s a highly interactive feature, and it involved working on a lot of different sounds, such as the sound of the Lift Vine itself but also player foley sounds and 2D in-ear wind components. This also meant learning to work with a lot of different graphs and systems in the game engine and creating solutions to make dynamic spatialization and motion for audio emitters, both in Snowdrop and Wwise. It was super cool to bring all the different parts of this feature together and use sound to help shape it into a cohesive experience for the player.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaOkrJBUf9g?si=2T6Uq6p2nYSqzWbu" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Veil Swarm">The Veil Swarm</h2><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Audio direction">Audio direction</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Veilswarm is a flock of small organisms, that the player’s Ikran (their winged mount and companion) can eat to replenish its stamina. They look like butterflies, but much bigger compared to butterflies on earth, so we wanted to have medium size wing flapping sounds. We didn’t want any kind of tonal screech or bird whistling sound as the Veilswarm is everywhere in the open world and hearing the same type of sound over and over would have become fatiguing. Something a bit more discreet was enough. Also, the open world already has a lot of tonal sounds coming from other flying animals, so there was no need to pile up in this field. Of course, we wanted it to sound like a swarm surrounding the player, and it especially needed to be convincing when the player flies through the swarm and they all disperse. So, we did a lot of work on these flapping sounds in terms of variety and texture, but also in terms of implementation, positioning and movement.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the player is flying on their Ikran and goes through the Veilswarm, the swarm will disperse but the Ikran will catch and eat a few of the animals to gain stamina.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Audio design">Audio design</h2><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMjuvvhCHas?si=8kfH0GfMliNnSQ1R" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The swarm spreads in all directions when the player flies through it. We play a windy whoosh sound when it spreads to give the player a sensation of speed and dynamism. We trigger it according to the player’s speed and distance from the Veilswarm. In addition to the whoosh sound, when it spreads, we trigger a one-shot agitated flapping sound. Another layer is an audio loop in a blend container with various assets based on distance to the player. It helps them find the Veilswarm while flying with the Ikran in the open world, while keeping the sound of the swarm grounded and convincing at various distances.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the player stays inside the swarm, while flying steadily, the swarm will surround them. In this case, a 2D stereo or quad agitated Veilswarm flapping sound plays (2D meaning not actually positioned in the world, but all around the player, as with the in-ear wind above). We switch between stereo or quad version according to the player’s speaker configuration. This 2D sound gives a good sense of being surrounded by the swarm by filling the entire sound field with a wide, bespoke audio asset.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAF7Qcgmxk8?si=v87MrzrRlc87TAC6" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the player moves inside the swarm, the little butterflies will quickly move to the sides, escaping from the Ikran’s attempt to eat them. We dynamically mix the sound using Wwise’s real time parameter controls (RTPC), based on camera movement, player distance from the object, player speed, and azimuth. We tweak the volume, pitch and spatialization using these RTPCs. The flapping sound dynamically increases in volume or pitch, and stays in sync with the visual when they spread on the sides, because we use the same data inputs as the visual in the graph object.</span></p><p>Wwise mixing RTPCs for the swarm spreading sound while inside it. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For better clarity when in coop, just like with the Lift Vine, we don’t want to hear this 2D sound from the local player perspective if the remote player triggers it.</span></p><p>Wwise switch container for local and remote player. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Veilswarm has 2 audio emitters. The first one plays in the origin of the graph object. The other one dynamically changes position according to the player’s position. It mirrors the player’s position, and its axis is the origin of the Veilswarm object. It helps the sound to be more vivid when the player stays inside the swarm and moves around.</span></p><p>When the player moves to the left, the upper emitter moves to the right. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p>When the player moves to the right, the upper emitter moves to the left.

Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Veilswarm was also a collaborative work. The player’s Ikran triggers an “eating” animation when going through it and it also involves some VFX when the little animals are being chewed by the Ikran (Pandora is a dangerous place…). The player character may react with a line of dialogue when the Ikran feeds, and the UI stamina bar regenerates with a small animation. So not only did the Veilswarm involve the work of a variety of different sound designers and voice designers, it also enabled us to collaborate with all those other departments working on this part of the experience.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sirens of the Deep, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s latest animated The Witcher movie - which is perhaps most notable for the fact it'll see Doug Cockle reprising his video game role as the gravelly voiced Geralt of Rivia - now has a release date, and is streaming from 11th February.
</p>
<p>
Sirens of the Deep is based on The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski's short story A Little Sacrifice, and begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. One thing leads to another, however, and everybody's favourite white-haired grump soon finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.
</p>
<p>
"He must count on friends — old and new," Netflix teases in its announcement, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

<p>
Geralt will be joined by Anya Chalotra and Joey Batey, reprising their live-action TV series roles of Yennefer and Jaskier respectively, and the whole thing is being directed by Kang Hei Chul - who helmed Netflix's previous animated Witcher movie, 2021's surprisingly decent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-best-look-yet-at-the-witchers-animated-prequel">Nightmare of the Wolf</a>. And if that's whet your appetite, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYzqa1CDTik">new two-minute trailer</a> to view.
</p><p>
As for what's next for Netflix's The Witcher, that'll be season four of the streaming service's divisive live-action adaptation, which sees Liam Hemsworth taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Henry Cavill's departure</a> in 2022. But if it's more Cockle you want, he'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">be back</a> in CD Projekt's recently unveiled next Witcher game - although not as the protagonist, given <a href="hhttps://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Ciri is officially the focus this time around</a>.

That’s one of the selling points behind <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a new RPG from some of the masterminds behind <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Rebel Wolves, formed in 2022 by a bunch of ex-CD Projekt Red developers, revealed the game this week in a new teaser trailer. It looks pretty legit. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196626" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The first game in what the studio hopes will be an entire new RPG saga, <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is a narrative-driven, single-player, open-world, dark fantasy action-RPG. It’s being made in Unreal Engine 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S, and PC. The game is currently in alpha with more updates promised later in the year. That’s another way of saying it probably won’t be out for a while. </p><p>Players will step into the shoes of a young warrior-turned-vampire named Coen who uses otherworldly powers, including teleporting around like Nightcrawler, to fight off enemies and navigate a world where monsters come in all different forms. Like I said,<em> The Witcher </em>with vampire powers. Here’s the cinematic trailer with a quick look at gameplay near the end:</p><p>Rebel Wolves was originally formed by <em>Witcher 3</em> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz after he left CDPR following an investigation into workplace bullying, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> ultimately found him not guilty of the charges. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to the same outlet last year</a></span>, he said he started the new studio out of a desire to go back to working in smaller teams where developers aren’t as pigeonholed into specific roles. He also said he’d be working on his empathy and prioritizing the well-being of the team. </p><p>Alongside its game announcement, Rebel Wolves also announced the hire of <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>’s creative director: Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz. The CDPR veteran was a quest designer on multiple <em>Witcher</em> games, including the card-based spinoffs<em> Gwent</em> and <em>Thronebreaker</em>. He was also in charge of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quests before later departing after the game released to do narrative consulting for other companies. </p><p>  “Throughout all my years in game development, story-driven role-playing adventures have always been something I was most passionate about,” Tomaszkiewicz said in a press release. “For me, nothing beats being able to fully immerse myself and discover handcrafted stories and worlds. There are so many fantastic RPGs out there today, however, I feel that there’s not only enough space but also a hunger among players for more captivating stories.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> seventh seasonal update, Season of Witchcraft, arrives on January 21 and will give players a whole new set of fan-favorite powers from an old Diablo class to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the new 25 Witchcraft Powers are taken almost directly from abilities used by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3's</a> Witch Doctor. The class hasn't made its way to Diablo 4 officially just yet, but Blizzard isn't being shy about paying homage to the frog-slinging mystic. Powers like Firebat Servants, various Hexes, Poison Frog Servants, Soul Harvest, and Piranhado are all taken from the Witch Doctor's Diablo 3 playbook and will be usable by any class.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521"></a><figcaption>Everything new that's coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 7.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To earn those Witchcraft Powers and others, players will need to aid a coven underneath the Tree of Whispers by completing new Whisper bounties and hunting down Headrotten enemies that have been stolen from the Tree of Whispers. Like some previous seasons, specific zones on the map will periodically transform into Headhunt zones where numerous Headrotten enemies can be found. After completing bounties in the zone, there is a rare chance for an Uprooted Cocoon to spawn a deadly boss that, once slain, can be returned to the coven underneath the Tree of Whispers for a greater reward. Players can also discover Rootholds within Headrotten zones. These seasonal dungeons need a key to unlock, but will further aid players in increasing their standing with the coven. The Tree of Whispers will additionally have a chance of rewarding players with an Ancestral Collection, which guarantees at least one Ancestral item.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new powers, players will be able to equip new Occult Gems that will further enhance their Witchcraft Powers. Many gems have effects that enhance specific categories of Witchcraft powers or are activated once a player equips a certain number of powers from a particular category. In addition to their unique effects, each Occult Gem grants 160 Armor and 8% Resist All, which should make them an attractive choice for those looking to take full advantage of their Witchcraft Powers.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big addition in Diablo 4 Season 7 is the Armory, a feature that will actually be a permanent feature going forward. Players will be able to create up to five loadouts per character that can be easily swapped between with the click of a button. Doing so will automatically equip the skills, Paragon Board, Glyphs, and gear saved to the loadout, allowing players to easily change builds without having to constantly reset their skill tree or Paragon Board. It will not cost gold to swap loadouts using the Armory--once a skill tree and Paragon Board have been saved to the Armory, that build can be swapped free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Other permanent changes coming in Season of Witchcraft include an improved layout to the area around the Tree of Whispers, as well as making it so each specific class quest only needs to be completed once per class. Players who afterward make a new character of the same class will be able to access their unique class power earlier without having to do the requisite quest. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-out-free-diablo-4-boosts-and-automatically-unlocking-those-annoying-lilith-altars/1100-6527717/" data-ref-id="1100-6527717">welcome back level boost</a> will be sticking around permanently, and Unique items with Greater Affixes will also be improved, with Unique powers having their minimum rolls increased when the item sports a Greater Affix. There is additionally a new Unique item for each class, and for Vessel of Hatred owners, three new runes to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard will share more details about Diablo 4 Season 7 during a developer livestream on January 16. Diablo 4 Season 6 revolved around the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion, which introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-how-to-unlock-and-equip-runewords/1100-6527208/" data-ref-id="1100-6527208">Runewords</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-mercenaries-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527178/" data-ref-id="1100-6527178">Mercenaries</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">co-op-only dungeon</a>.</p>

			<p>The Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign is launching today to further expand the action role-playing game in development by The Farm 51 with new features, including a highly requested one.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, The Farm 51 listened to and analyzed fan feedback regarding the game, noticing how the switch from the first-person combat view of the first entry in the series to the new third-person perspective of the sequel was the most critical issue. As such, the studio decided to fix the issue by introducing a switchable third-person and first-person combat perspective, but to do so, it is asking fans for support. More information on the fundraising campaign can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-an-open-world-sci-fi-rpg/">Kickstarter page.</a></p>
<p>To celebrate the beginning of the Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign, The Farm 51 also released a new gameplay trailer showcasing some of the game's most prominent features. You can check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KICKSTARTER LAUNCH TRAILER - Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5lRDzR54eo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is aiming for a late 2025 release date. You can learn more about how the second entry in the series will expand the formula of its predecessor by checking out our interview with the game's Development Director conducted during<a href="https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-qa-20-times-bigger-world-2-3x-longer-playtime/"> Gamescom 2024.</a></p>

            <p>A quick one: Firaxis have confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> will be Steam Deck verified at launch. It's a pleasant surprise, given that 2016's Civ 6 is still only listed as "playable" on Valve's oversized Switch. I like this news about as much as I'm terrified to realise that Civ 7 is just under a month away. I do not need that much strategy game, this early in the year. But hey, at least I'll be able to play the new 4X in bed as Sid Meier intended.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Admittedly, I don't currently own a Steam Deck - James, ever the fickle lord of hardware, took back the one I was borrowing last year. I'll get that guy. But I've been playing a lot of 4Xs in bed, as it happens. I've just discovered that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a>'s brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> runs comfortably on my Dell work laptop. Current activities: trying to find a new location for my roving beetle city that has both a strategic resource and a luxury resource within easy building distance.</p>
<p>There are no giant beetles in Civ 7, but the two games do share a campaign structure in the shape of age-based progression. Every time your civilisation enters a new age, you get to pick from a pool of epoch-making options determined by your prior accomplishments. When playing multiplayer, you have the option of confining the proceedings to a single age. It sounds like quite a significant refresh of the whole caveman-to-spaceman concept. Also significant: in a first for Civ, you can choose your leader separately from your civilisation.</p>
<p>Civ 7 is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games of 2025</a>. "It looks very pretty, and it has some very intriguing ideas (navigable rivers and commander units), and also Gwendoline Christie," summarised Ollie. It's out 11th February and you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-fans-react-poorly-to-patch-10-04-map-changes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games has committed to changing VALORANT’s map pool every single act, but the next map swap set for Patch 10.04 is not being well received. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second act of the 2025 season</a> will see the removal of Abyss and Bind, and the return of Ascent and Icebox.</p>



<p>While many players won’t miss Abyss, there is a widespread feeling of disappointment that both Ascent and Icebox are returning. That is, unless they return with some changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-patch-10-04-map-changes">VALORANT Patch 10.04 Map Changes</h2>



<p>As part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT’s new yearly season model</a>, the team at Riot has pledged to making map pool changes each act. There are currently 11 standard maps, with seven making up the active pool. Riot said at the beginning of the year that the initial plan is to swap two each act, but noted that number “might change” throughout the year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When the second act of 2025 begins on March 4, Patch 10.04 will replace Abyss and Bind with Icebox and Ascent. This change has not sat well with the community though, especially on the pro side. Prior to this current act, Ascent was the only map that had never been rotated out, and now it’s being reinstated after just a few weeks. Icebox has also been one of the more disliked maps across the community, but <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1879198967541764168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of the replies</a> to the official announcement are upset about Ascent’s fast return.</p>



<p>Fans and members of the VALORANT pro scene are also not pleased about the impending changes. Sentinels’ coach Adam Kaplan <a href="https://x.com/itskaplan/status/1879214468674277613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is frustrated</a> with announcing the map changes ahead of time, claiming teams that don’t make the first Masters event of the year will have twice as much time to prepare for the new maps. Kaplan also says this will lead to an increase in burnout, as teams that attend Masters will have no time to rest if they don’t want to get out-prepped for Ascent and Icebox.</p>



<p>Is it too soon to bring Ascent back? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-event-release-date-godzilla-skin-king-kong-crossover-what-to-expect/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite’s long-awaited Godzilla event is nearly here. With a King Kong appearance and special skins, the event is hotly anticipated. Its release date is known, so here’s a rundown.</p>



<p>I’m having deja vu from Warzone Caldera’s epic Godzilla and King Kong event. But Epic is having a crack with Fortnite’s Godzilla event featuring the two titanic creatures. Godzilla and King Kong are arguably at the top of the food chain when it comes to monster movies, and their presence is sure to be felt in Fortnite. Does anyone fancy a trip to Skull Island while King Kong is away?</p>



<p>If not, I’ll instead break down this King Kong-sized collaboration.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-godzilla-live-event-release-date">When is the Fortnite Godzilla Live Event Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A Godzilla-sized event approaches. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Godzilla x Kong event is expected to launch on January 17.</strong></p>



<p>January 14 featured downtime for the shooter as Epic prepares for the upcoming heavyweight battle. Maintenance provided enough time to complete the transition to version 33.20. But it’s also the first hurdle (a big one) as we prepare for the arrival of Godzilla and King Kong.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn its exact start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-godzilla-evolved-and-mecha-godzilla-skins-in-fortnite">How to Get Godzilla Evolved and Mecha Godzilla Skins in Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Godzilla Evolved Skin and Mecha Godzilla Skins are available to obtain from the Chapter 6, Season 1 Battle Pass</strong> <strong>on January 17.</strong></p>



<p>It’s no surprise to learn both Godzilla skins go live along with the event start date. Here’s a quick guide in case you’re unaware of the Godzilla skins:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open up Fortnite.</li>



<li>Purchase the Chapter 6, Season 1 Battle Pass.</li>



<li>Wait for the Locked Pages to become available on January 17.</li>



<li>Complete the objectives to earn the special, limited-time skins.</li>
</ol>



<p>Many Fortnite skins are locked away for a long time after their initial appearance. I would recommend you <strong>act quickly</strong> if you want the Godzilla Evolved and Mecha Godzilla Skins. </p>



<p>They’re likely to be available for purchase later down the line, but it’s not worth risking the wrath of the mega-tall monsters.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-fortnite-godzilla-event">What to Expect From the Fortnite Godzilla Event</h2>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but full-scale interactions with both Godzilla and King Kong are expected in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-transformation-mythic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Godzilla Transformation Mythic</a> has leaked (thanks to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hypex</a>). It’s thought you can <strong>turn into Godzilla</strong> and use its “Beam, Stomp, and Roar” abilities. Plus, a “throw banana” ability has been outed by the leaker too—meaning <strong>control of King Kong</strong> is also swinging its way into Fortnite!</p>



<p>The consensus is a <strong>fight is brewing between King Kong and Godzilla</strong>—à la the movies. We’re not sure if it plays out via a cutscene, or if we have the incredible honor of getting caught in the fire, fists, and swinging tails. All I am certain of is it’s going to be Epic (pun intended).</p>



<hr>



<p>Where does the Fortnite Godzilla Event rank in terms of all-time hype? Is it one of Epic’s better efforts? What’s a crossover the company desperately needs to do that Fortnite hasn’t done yet?</p>



<p>Speaking of which, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-cyberpunk-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite and Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> is coming, so make sure to read up on the collab. Plus, check out the addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hatsune-miku-fortnite-skin-leaks-online-before-fortnite-festival-season-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hatsune Miku Fortnite Skin</a>.</p>

            <p>
Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders, the ski-based sequel to developer Megagon Industries' acclaimed biking game Lonely Mountains: Downhill, now has a release date and is launching for Xbox, PC, and Game Pass next Tuesday, 21st January.
</p>
<p>
As was the case with 2019's Lonely Mountains: Downhill, Snow Riders is all about getting from the top to the bottom of those gorgeously low-poly peaks as stylishly or as speedily as possible - albeit with those mountains now festooned with ice and blanketed in thick snow.
</p>
<p>
Snow Riders' meticulously crafted mountains feature the usual deluge of craftily concealed shortcuts to seek out in a bid to shave precious seconds off descent times, and there's a new tricks system too. But the big difference is the introduction of online multiplayer, turning what was previously an occassionally serene solitary pursuit into a decidedly more chaotic affair.

<p>
Solo play is still available, of course, but it's joined by team-based co-op - which sees players sharing their limited checkpoints - alongside competitive races. And that's on top of challenges to complete, plus new equipment, outfits, and tricks to unlock along the way.
</p><p>
Lonely Mountains: Downhill was an absolute treat (Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-lonely-mountains-downhill-is-a-magic-game-of-pure-sensation">called it</a> "magic" when it made Eurogamer's top picks list in 2019), and Snow Riders' recent Steam demo suggests Megagon Industries has another winner on its hands. All will be revealed when it launches for Xbox, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/">Steam</a>, and Game Pass in exactly one week's time, on 21st January.

We've been a few years removed from all of AAA just having to focus on realism in graphics, and the results of that have been awesome. The art direction from those big and small has been stellar, with 2024 being no different.</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Best Visual Design for outstanding, cohesive aesthetic.</p>

<ul><li>Astro Bot</li>
	<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
	<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
	<li>Neva</li>
	<li>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Neva</h2>



<p>Developer: Nomada Studio | Release Date: October 15th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p>To this day, <em>Gris </em>remains one of the most beautiful games ever made (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/2018-techraptor-awards-best-visuals-award" rel="nofollow">winning this award in 2018</a>), so it's no surprise to see the next game from Nomada Studio on this list either.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Neva </em>is full of beautiful hand-drawn art and animations that place you in a fantastical world inspired in large part by Studio Ghibli works. It is striking, evocative, and uses clean lines and clear flat images to make it easy to see exactly what's on the screen.</p>

<p>It feels cliche to make this statement, but every frame of <em>Neva </em>feels like its own piece of unique, gorgeous art. That is an incredible feat, as when that phrase is used for something like film, the creator controls the camera. Here, we get to shift focus and move around at will. So it's quite the testament that Nomada was able to make every piece of <em>Neva </em>so enrapturing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Second Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: February 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> set the stage for an incredible retelling of a legendary JRPG, dutifully recreating Midgard in amazing detail. However, everyone knew the next steps beyond Midgard would be vast; would <em>Rebirth </em>be able to to live up to the hype?</p>

<p>Square Enix delivered, bringing its world to life in stunning beauty, lush colors, and vibrant environments. Green plains, rocky canyons, dusty deserts, all populated with lived-in towns that dot the landscape. And if you've entered and explored Gold Saucer, I don't need to tell just how breathtaking and overwhelming that place is.</p>

<p>The character models are also worth noting here. Cloud and the rest of the party, along with Sephiroth, all look and feel as iconic as they did in the '90s, but with modern-day details and flourishes. They have flair, and their character models are easily among the best in this semi-realistic animated style.</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>Is<em> Metaphor: Refantazio</em> a graphically impressive game? No, not particularly. So why, then, did it win best visual design? Running on the same engine as <em>Persona 5 </em>and <em>Catherine</em>, it’s a dated engine, no doubt. It’s what Studio Zero does with those limitations that’s impressive.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a masterclass in UI design. It has a visual flair to it that only Atlus games seem to capture. Its Renaissance-esque style fits its vibrant and magical setting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Character portraits are another highlight; they are incredibly well-drawn and bring<em> Metaphor</em>’s cast of characters to life, making up for what the graphics lack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a look at some of <em>Metaphor’</em>s “Human” designs, too, and you’ll see inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch, a real-life painter. The designs translate wonderfully into the game and create an unmatched and undeniably distinguished style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our preview of the full <em>Soulbound</em> rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-soulbound-preview" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and our review of the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> core rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we get into <em>Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em>, it's worth noting the difference between <em>Age of Sigmar (AoS)</em>, and <em>Warhammer</em> (now known as <em>Warhammer the Old World</em> in Games Workshop's latest tabletop iteration). The original <em>Warhammer</em> was Games Workshop's fantasy wargaming system.</p>

<p>In 2015 (a decade this year and we're still having this conversation) Games Workshop had a narrative event called the End Times, which ended the Old World and started the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> system, along with moving the narrative completely away and into a new fantasy setting (with many of the same elements, but also a lot of changes). Games Workshop has also since re-released (in January 2024) the <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> game, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I mention the above because Cubicle 7 publishes 2 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying systems. <em>Age of Sigmar Soubound</em>, for which we are reviewing the Starter Set here, is set in Games Workshop's premier fantasy setting, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP)</em>, which is set in Games Workshop's original fantasy system. <em>WFRP</em> also persevered throughout the removal of <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> from Games Workshop's wargaming range throughout the 2015-2024 gap.</p>

<p>We'll go into details of both settings in our coverage of the systems, but a quick summary is that <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> is set in a more traditional fantasy setting, with the races of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and Skaven (ratmen) all battling over the map of the Old World, and&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> sees the different races fighting across 8 different Mortal Realms, 8 unique planes of existence, connected through realm gates. A lot of the classic races are included, but they have a unique Games Workshop twist in <em>AoS</em>.</p>

<p>Most roleplaying products start with a single book, either a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow">Core Rulebook</a>, which contains everything players and Games Masters (GM) need to run the games,&nbsp;or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Players Handbook</a>, which focuses on the core mechanics and player options, expanding into other books for the Games Master&nbsp;(which we see historically in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> by Wizards of the Coast). <em>Soulbound</em> has a Core Rulebook available, but also to make it even easier, the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set has everything 5 players plus a GM need to play their first few games in one easy package, with no printing or other products required.</p>

<p>This <em>Soulbound</em> starter set contains extremely well-produced, visually engaging, and coordinated components that allow players to get going easily, with an experienced GM. The GM gets 2 books, Faltering Light, which is the adventure and rules for running <em>Soulbound</em> out of the Starter Set, and the Brightspear City Guide, which fleshes out the city that the adventure is set in with details and adventure hooks (and stats for other enemies) for continuing your campaign in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Faltering Light acts as a tutorial, guiding players through the rules whist exploring the adventure, and it works for someone who might be new to running roleplaying games as a GM too, but they will need to do some preparation beforehand. Reading through the whole adventure, making notes, and getting the hang of the rules, as they will be the one guiding the players through their first games. This preparation will set you up for your future career as a GM running games, as you don't have the player's luxury of just turning up on game night to play, most GMs do a lot of background work in preparing the adventure for the players.</p>

<p>The players can get going pretty quickly with <em>Soulbound</em> out of the Starter Set, as the character sheets are very well produced, starting with a full-color image of the character on the back, along with character details including a fantastic 'why play' section on the front. The sheets open up to show all the stats, talents, and equipment, as well as a quick rules breakdown for the character sheet elements so you don't need to keep grabbing the rulebook. They also have a character background section, where you can pick goals, connections, and secrets to add depth and your own spin on the character.</p>

<p>The final starter set components are dice (a set of 8 custom 6-sided dice, but it's helpful if all players have their own set of 4 to 8 dice), an introductory leaflet, that doubles as the party details sheet on the back, some quick reference rules sheets a double-sied Brightspear map for the players. The box is also dual use, and the GM can use as a screen to keep his notes and rolls secret, and handily has its own map and quick reference sheets printed on the inside.</p>

<p>The <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set player experience begins with selecting a character. The <em>Soulbound</em> Core Rulebook has an impressive 23 character types to choose from, and the Starter Set has 5 pre-generated characters from those, taking a traditional roleplaying party of classes and races with the <em>Age of Sigmar </em>spin on it. Each character has a unique feel and party role, but will also feel comfortable to those who might be new to roleplaying. For example, Vel Arturious is a Stormcast Eternal, one of Sigmar's immortal fighters who like to go toe to toe with the enemy and Imren Sealgaire is an Idoneth Deepkin Tidecaster, a sea-elf magic user.</p>

<p>The other members of the party include Xan Bemyr, a human war priest, Malgra Dainsson, a dwarven engineer, and Darach a walking tree ranger (think a cross between Aragorn from <em>The&nbsp;Lord of the Rings</em> and Groot from <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=2CY8UReJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=j8mWBxA0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The inside of the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set box handily doubles as a screen for the Games Master, with some useful details printed on the inside.</figcaption></figure><h2>Chaos Everywhere!</h2>

<p>The core <em>Soulbound</em> system is slightly different from what you might have experienced in other systems, and it has some interesting complexity that provides a lot of flexibility in what is an epicly heroic system. As with any system, <em>Soulbound</em> requires a player to roll a dice and beat a number set by the difficulty of the task. The number of dice the player rolls comes from 1 of 3 core stats, Body, Mind, and Soul. Additional dice are added for skills that the character may have that apply to the test.</p>

<p>The flexibility comes with the combination of the target number required to roll, most tests require a 4 but this is raised and lowered depending on how difficult the test is. The number of successes required can also change depending on the circumstances. This system allows flexibility beyond single-roll systems, allowing the GM to flex between difficulty and complexity. Finding a specific sentence in an unknown book in a library would require a lot of low successes, picking a lock might require a single high success, and picking the lock on the greatest safe ever made, would require a lot of high successes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The system flows very well and is introduced as you progress through the adventure, which is intriguing, but very focused on a specific aspect of Chaos, which would be my only criticism of the adventure. It gives a great first impression, but not a very rounded one to someone who might be brand new to the setting. It would of course be difficult to give a fully rounded impression of the whole setting, as it's taken Cubicle 7 years and multiple supplements to cover all of it, but an introduction to some of the races and all of the Chaos gods would have been nice to see (and obviously a lot more work for a less experienced GM, or an experienced GM new to the setting).</p>

<h2>Age Of Sigmar Soulbound Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em> Starter Set is a great package, incredibly well-produced with great-looking components. The characters give a rounded first introduction to the setting, with awesome character sheets full of detail. The 2 books for the Games Master do a great job of introducing the setting and system and also allowing the GM to expand without buying further products if they want to test beyond the initial adventure with their players. The system itself is fun and engaging, fitting well with the heroic nature of the setting.</p>

However, in light of the actions of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24319728/unitedhealthcare-luigi-mangione-brian-thompson-reaction">Luigi Mangione</a>, the man charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the gaming community’s love for Luigi has taken on a different significance. That significance was on full display during AGDQ 2025 where his name popped up early and often.</p><p>During the charity speedrunning marathon, there were frequent opportunities for viewers to have their donations fund bidding wars for things like the player completing a specific task during the run or for naming rights to a character. For example, during the <em>Pokémon: Let’s Go Eevee</em> run, viewers could donate for the privilege of naming the trainer, and they picked Luigi. Throughout the marathon viewers submitted Luigi for almost every naming-based bid war, and it won quite often.</p><p>Luigi was the character name in <a href="https://youtu.be/HtUKlxIbUK8?si=ZZBeIPgbgSLhJ4Ek"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/u4RzOF9e850?si=dfqAo6effNtqh52B"><em>Skyrim</em></a>. He was the name for the warrior in <a href="https://youtu.be/OL3F-RryYT0?si=UJet1zlLk187DBus"><em>Guantlet IV</em></a> and it was the file name in <a href="https://youtu.be/GbR_QqEGBcM?si=GhC9hb8nse2LThzB"><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em></a>. And of the four named characters in <a href="https://youtu.be/qdkLgOEKsOs?si=Hv3unZXT1ajt0H8K"><em>Final Fantasy Legend 2</em></a>, “Lugi” was three of them (as the game only supports four-letter names). Overall, all of the bids for Luigi — not just those that ultimately won — earned over $18,000.</p><p>Games Done Quick has a reputation for its inclusiveness and social consciousness — once <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23341082/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-online-event-florida-ron-desantis">cancelling a live event in Florida in 2023</a> over the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law and lax COVID-19 policies. So while it’s impossible to know for sure whether or not the preponderance of Luigi was due to typical gamer memeing or if it represented some kind of tacit statement of support for Luigi Mangione’s actions, it’s probably easy to say it was a little bit of both.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“We totally fucked up here,” said game director Jonathan Rogers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxzTAcJqAM">a podcast with GhazzyTV</a>, explaining how the hack began with a compromised Steam account linked to an administrative account on the game's website - effectively giving the hacker the same access as customer service, said Rogers. This allowed the hacker to reset passwords and log in as other players.</p>
<p>The next bit involves the sort of granular detail 404 Media are obviously much better at explaining than me, so I'm just going to quote them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinarily, whenever a member of Path of Exile 2’s support staff makes a change, that event is added to a list for potential later auditing. But when it came to resetting passwords, a bug meant that change was saved as a “note” and not an event, Rogers said. The hacker was then able to delete the note saying a password had been changed, an apparent attempt by the hacker to cover their tracks too. Because of this, it wasn’t immediately obvious to GGG what was happening with these account compromises, Rogers said.</p>
<p>“66 notes were deleted, so that would imply that 66 accounts were compromised,” Rogers said, although caveated that GGG only keeps logs for 30 days. Interestingly, the compromise “was all prelaunch of POE2,” Rogers said, meaning that the hacker gained access before the game was even available to the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>404 mention these incidents echo other reports of items being stolen in December, but it does sound like it's all been caught and sorted now, with Rogers considering introducing two-factor authentication to player accounts after rolling it out for support accounts in the wake of the incident.</p><p>I've personally been really enjoying POE 2, although I'm playing it very slowly, soaking up the vivid horror and wonderful soundtrack before I inevitably become numb to it all and turn into a loot goblin. "Even incomplete, this huge early access ARPG is a gem," wrote Sophie Glass in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">her review</a>, "with a unique and flexible skill system and compelling world".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled "Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake". Don't ask me why people have started labelling fires. It's probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda's somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The peddler of this particular leak is <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">MP1st</a>, who I cherish for their minute attention to things like multiplayer shooter update changelogs, but don't especially know as a spreader of inside gossip. As such, I was wary of writing this up yesterday. But on reflection, there is a paper trail: an Oblivion remake is mentioned (among many other things) on the 2020 planning document Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">accidentally shared as part of FTC court proceedings back in 2023</a>. So here I am playing Journo Come Lately.
</p>
<p>
MP1st attribute their information to the website of a "former Virtuos employee" who worked on the game from 2023 to 2024. They'd rather not say who or link to the website in question because they want to protect the user's privacy, which I'm sure has nothing to do with wanting other sites to link to them so they can rank highly on Google for the term "Oblivion remake".</p>
<p>My sibling journalists, if that's the actual thinking here, I am not judging. When I was OXM's online editor I had a whole network of speculative <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> DLC pieces that daisy-chained to each other in a slow-mo SEO centrifuge of surgically imagined Dwemer fan fiction. Given that everything lives in the cloud, now, I'm pretty sure current Bethesda developers struggle to distinguish my Tamrielic Google-stew from the official lore bible. They're probably training AIs with it. I suspect it's a core component of the plot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-news-exclusivity-races-setting">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.
</p><p>
Anyway, the former Virtuos employee supposedly cited by MP1st claims that Oblivion is being "fully remade" using Epic's ubiquitous Unreal tools, rather than Bethesda's Creation Engine (a descendant of the Gamebryo engine originally used for Oblivion). Apparently, the project makes changes to six particular aspects of the 2006 game: in MP1st's paraphrase, "Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD".
</p>
<p>
As regards blocking, the remake developers have apparently taken inspiration from Soulslikes, because the old system was too "boring" and "frustrating". The presentation of sneaking has allegedly been freshened up with highlighted icons, and damage calculation has been reworked. The remake's handling of stamina is said to be more forgiving - it's harder to get knocked down when you run out of juice. The HUD has been revamped for younger players, and they've added hit reactions for the player and NPCs to make combat more readable. Archery, finally, now has a selection of third and first-person viewpoints.
</p>
<p>
All of which sounds plausible enough, in that I could use approximately this combination of ideas to describe any number of remakes of games from the mid-aughts.
</p>
<p>
Let's briefly return to that leaked 2020 Microsoft planning document. It had the Oblivion remaster down for release in fiscal year 2022. I'm pretty sure that didn't happen? If it did, our standing with Bethesda PR is even worse than I thought. Perhaps the 2020 planning document was actually an AI-generated descendant of my network of articles on the doings of the Dwemer. I am reporting upon a hell of my own creation!</p><p>It can't be, though, because the document also made mention of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> remaster and, perhaps most excitingly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-is-the-only-exciting-thing-on-bethesdas-leaked-5-year-plan-and-im-worried">Dishonored 3</a>. We'll hopefully get closure on all this at <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/">the next Xbox Developer Direct</a> on 23rd January. There's a "brand new game" in the offing.</p>
<p>Oblivion is perhaps the least-loved of the Elder Scrolls, or the least trendy, anyway. It's sort of a big green lobby area parked between the oddness of Morrowind and the grandness of Skyrim. Still, it made a splash as the first proper Elder Scrolls game for consoles, and I'm intrigued by the notion that it might be considered hip again. After all, it's hip to like things other people hate. I’m off to write another load of SEO-teasing fan fiction about the tragedy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6hVmn9FM7o">Fithragaer</a>, the most absent-minded battlemage in Cyrodiil.

Geralt, exhausted and ornery from his latest fallout with the sorcerer Yennifer, embarks on a little side-quest with the bard Dandelion to try to prevent all-out war between land dwellers and Merpeople. Lots of grunting, grim quips, and bloody fights ensue.</p><p>I’m still not sold on the animation style, and hopefully there are more twists than meet the eye in the full movie, but any chance to watch Doug Cockle, Geralt’s voice actor from the video game trilogy, reprise his role is welcome.

Since it launched, the game has received numerous updates  improving the mode, introducing new features, and adding new songs. And now Epic has added what might be the best feature yet.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/virtual-artist-hatsune-miku-beams-into-fortnite-festival-season-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/virtual-artist-hatsune-miku-beams-into-fortnite-festival-season-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On January 13, Epic Games released Season 7</a></span> of <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. The new season is headlined by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/yPuI4l0jK7s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/yPuI4l0jK7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hatsune Miku</a></span> and includes music from the digital pop star as well as items based on her design. But this season also added local multiplayer. Yes, you can  finally invite your friends over and (sort of) recreate the magic of <em>Rock Band</em> in <em>Fortnite </em>via 4 player same screen co-op.</p><p>Even better,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-festival-season-3-guitar-controller-support-pc-1851429714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-festival-season-3-guitar-controller-support-pc-1851429714"> back in Season 3</a></span>, Epic added plastic guitar support for <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. So you might be able to pull out that old Xbox or PlayStation guitar from the closet and hook it up and jam together with players using controllers.</p><p>Now there are some restrictions on <em>Festival </em>local play. A small one is that this co-op mode is only available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.  The bigger restriction is that each player needs to have an Epic Games account and be signed into the console and <em>Fortnite</em>. Epic specifically says you can’t use guest accounts on either console. That’s annoying, but to get around this you could just create a few free Epic Game accounts and tie them to some free PSN or Xbox accounts. Then, when people come over to jam, just log each controller into those dummy accounts before playing.</p><p> Sadly, <em>Fortnite </em>has yet to add plastic drum support or the ability to use a microphone, so it ain’t quite a full <em>Rock Band</em> replacement yet. But hey, we’re getting there!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
