			<p>We're only a day away from the official launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Following the early critic reviews and initial industry <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-high-praise-from-larians-director-of-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressions</a>, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson shared the company's excitement about the game's sales potential. Speaking to investors during the Q2 2025 earnings call (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/electronic-arts-ea-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcribed</a> by The Motley Fool), he said:</p>
<p><em>It's an amazing time at EA, and in two days, we will launch Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It's been ten years since we launched its predecessor, Game of the Year winner Dragon Age: Inquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high quality, depth, and detail in this year's action-packed adventure. We expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our blockbuster storytelling engages and connects fans in truly unique ways.</em></p>
<p><em>I certainly think Veilguard has breakout potential. Again, 10 years ago, Dragon Age: Inquisition was Game of the Year and a very strong performer for us. This is entertainment. While much of our business has moved to live service, this opportunity to bring in incredibly high-quality, creative storytelling set in an amazing world with rich characters living out those stories, you are able to capture that moment in entertainment and success almost certainly follows. We see that in the context of movies, TV seasons, and videogames. When we think about what we have with Veilguard right now, we have a storied studio in BioWare and a storied IP in Dragon Age.</em></p>
<p><em>We have a team that took extra time to make sure the world was rich and the characters were interesting and the story was compelling. I think we're going into a market that has limited competition for this category of game given some of the moves that have happened across the broader industry. While I think it's too early to predict the outcome, the critical reviews have been incredibly strong. The team feels really energized by what they have delivered, and my sense is that yes, it has breakout capabilities.</em></p>
<p>We recently learned from Executive Producer Mark Darrah that Dragon Age: Inquisition sold 12 million units lifetime, becoming BioWare's best-selling game. We'll have to see whether Veilguard can achieve similar success, but EA certainly is confident based on pre-orders and critical reception.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved my time with the game, as you can read in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>If the game sells well, there's a chance we might get some DLC, a topic on which BioWare hasn't commented at all so far. The DLCs made for Inquisition, Trespasser specifically, were some of the best content released for the previous game, so here's hoping.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio's next big project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next Mass Effect</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisofts-year-of-turmoil-continues-with-weird-nft-game-launch.1023111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has quietly released an NFT game by the unfortunate name of&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>. Yes, you read that right, and no, you haven't blacked out and woken up in the year 2022.</p>

<p>The tactical RPG was released last week as a free-to-play PC game, but you'd be forgiven for missing its launch completely, because Ubisoft doesn't seem like it's particularly eager to market the game.</p>

<p>There's no mention of its launch on the studio's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) feed</a> from around launch day, nor does it appear on Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/videos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, despite the fact that this is a game that was developed in-house by Ubisoft and not farmed out to a third party.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=t44WejQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=nohDDi8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>is an NFT-based tactical RPG battler, and yes, it has launched this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As noted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT system comes in the form of buyable figurines, which you can technically also craft using in-game currency. This being an NFT game, though, I'm assuming its in-game economy will incentivize you to buy NFTs.</p>

<p>According to IGN, figurines (i.e. characters) in&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT marketplace range from around $7 to an eye-watering $63,000, although whether the seller actually expects players to pay that much is another matter.</p>

<p>You haven't turned over two pages at once here, either; this is absolutely a full-blown, honest-to-goodness NFT game launching in the year of our lord 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, Ubisoft isn't the only company that's still got some skin in the NFT game. In August, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-launching-its-own-blockchain-for-nfts-and-play-to-earn-games">launched its own blockchain</a> for NFT and play-to-earn games, and last year, Sega <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game">declared its intention</a> to create an NFT Web3 game based on an "immensely popular" franchise.</p>




<p>Still, NFTs don't exactly feel like the place Ubisoft needs to be in right now, especially given that the company is having a pretty rough year so far thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">investor threats</a>, major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">game delays</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">a lawsuit</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>That's not to mention the very public failure of&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>, the long-awaited pirate MMO that limped out of the gate back in February to a lukewarm reception, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">not least from us</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>(and don't blame yourself if you immediately forget that name after you close this article) goes anywhere remains to be seen, but if you want to, you can <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out here</a>.</p>

            <p>Hark! Comments have been temporarily turned off on Rock Paper Shotgun. We and all of our sibling websites are moving to a new commenting platform and the existing comments need to be ported across. This process will take some time - days, perhaps - and we'll update this post once it's complete and commenting functionality has been restored.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In brief, we need to take a snapshot of the almost 2 million comments posted on RPS over the last seventeen years, then import them into the new system. It's better if new comments aren't being created in that time.
</p>
<p>Once comments return, you shouldn't need to do anything differently. Your login and site account will remain the same as before, but the comment section itself will have a different look and feel and probably a few different features. We'll share more details once the switchover happens.
</p>
<p>If we had been able to plan this further in advance, we would have published a series of articles containing our most controversial opinions, to take advantage of your brief inability to yell at us. But alas, it wasn't to be. Instead I'll say that I truly value the comment community here and I look forward to hearing from you all again on these pages soon. In the meantime, you can make yourself heard by <a href="mailto:graham@rockpapershotgun.com">emailing me</a> with  any thoughts, questions or feedback.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Charlie Cox was so brilliant as the lawyer-cum-crime-fighter, but human shapeshifter Vincent D’Onofrio was the stand-out star as Wilson Fisk, his performance so utterly mesmerizing and terrifying. Both reprise their roles in <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>, along with, well, the whole cast! Deborah Ann Wolf and Elden Henson are back too, despite not appearing in the clips, as well as Jon Bernthal returning as Frank “The Punisher” Castle. The only disappointment for me is no sign of Krysten Ritter returning as Jessica Jones.</p><h2 id="h197804"><a id=""></a><em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em></h2><p>However, it’s far from alone in looking promising. There’s the new <em>Spider-Man</em> animation, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em>, which, while doomed to lie in the shadow of the impeccable <em>Spider-Verse</em> movies, is set in the MCU! It features live-action actors reprising roles, such as Charlie Cox playing Daredevil and Vincent D’Onofrio as Kingpin, along with the likes of Paul F. Tompkins and Eugene Byrd (as Lonnie Lincoln, rather than Jefferson Morales who he played in <em>Spidey and His Amazing Friends</em>). However, rather sadly there’s no sign of Tom Holland, with Spidey himself played by Hudson Thames, who voiced the character in season one of <em>What If? </em>It streams on January 25.</p><h2 id="h197805"><a id=""></a><em>Ironheart</em></h2><p>There’s also <em>Ironheart</em>, which sees the character—Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne)—who first appeared in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> spin off into her own show. She’s a genius teenage inventor, and has created a suit that might be better than Tony Stark’s. This one’s been held back forever, with filming apparently completed in 2022, suggesting a horrendous amount of post-production meddling. It’s finally on Disney Plus June 24.</p><h2 id="h197806"><a id=""></a><em>Wonder Man</em></h2><p>A show I’d never heard of before now, <em>Wonder Man</em> looks immediately intriguing. It’s based on the extremely long-running comic character, but seems to be making an origin story of its own. Ben Kingsley is once again playing his bonkers role, originally from <em>Iron Man 3</em>, of Trevor Slattery, seemingly casting a new superhero TV show called <em>Wonder Man</em>... Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Morpheus in <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> and Black Manta in DC’s <em>Aquaman 2</em>) auditions for the role of Wonder Man, and seems to have powers of his own? Very early days on this one, as it’s not airing until December 2025.</p><h2 id="h197807"><a id=""></a>The Rest</h2><p>Along with <em>What If?</em>, there are two other animations—<em>Marvel Zombies</em> and <em>Eyes of Wakanda</em>. The former is a <em>What If?</em> spin-off and I’m struggling to care, but the latter is much more interesting, an exploration of Wakandan warriors throughout history. <em>Eyes</em> is out August 6, 2025, with <em>Zombies</em> following October 25.</p><p>Marvel’s TV outings have come to be known by many as “homework”; an obligation to sit through in order to understand what is going on in the big-screen movies. It’s hard to argue against that when it comes to  sitting through something like the snore-fest of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, if you want to know what’s going on in the forthcoming <em>Thunderbolts*</em>. (Don’t look for a footnote, that’s the dumb name of the film.) But turning your back also means you’d miss out on the complete joy of <em>Ms. Marvel</em>, and all its setup for the lovely and hilarious movie <em>The Marvels</em>. It’s a minefield, and one distinctly not helped by the way Disney Plus refuses to create a section just for its TV shows on its app.</p><p>Oh, and if you aren’t watching <em>Agatha All Along</em>, you’re doing life wrong.</p><p>However, this slate certainly looks more promising than the recent disappoints of <em>Echo, Secret Invasion, </em>and the god-awful second season of <em>Loki. </em>Perhaps less homework and more enjoyable screen-time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> aims to run "smoothly" at 60fps across both Xbox Series X and its lesser-powered sibling, the Series S.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/indiana-jones-great-circle-runs-at-60-fps-on-xbox-series-x-s-interview">Windows Central</a>, creative director Axel Torvenius touched on the game's technical performance.</p>
<p>"It might be that we will release even more details in terms of specifics, technical details, as we get closer to launch, once we see all the telemetry on performance," the developer began. "But what I can tell you is that the ambition is that the game runs at 60fps on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and that, you know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product."</p>

<p>Torvenius said the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle team want the experience to feel "cohesive" for players, meaning the game should run "smoothly at 60" across both Xbox Series X and Series S.</p>
<p>The Series S console has tripped up developers in the past. Earlier this year, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> admitted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-developer-says">getting the game ready for Microsoft's lower-powered Xbox Series S would be a "challenge"</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">Baldur's Gate 3 famously released several months later on Xbox</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">difficulties with split screen co-op</a> on the Series S console.</p><p>Things are looking up for Series S owners, however. Recently, the Stalker 2 team said it hopes to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/stalker-2-xbox-series-s-pc">provide a performance mode at 60fps</a> at some point for its upcoming release on the Series S console. While it hasn't promised anything at this time, developer GSC said: "We think it's possible."</p>

<p>For more on Indy, our Ian recently went hands on with the Great Circle.</p>
<p>"I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it. It's shaping up to be a wonderful love letter to Indiana Jones, just like Rogue City was to Robocop, and anyone who counts themselves a fan of the movie trilogy (there's definitely only been three movies, don't know what you're talking about) should definitely have this on their radar," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A second crack at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> isn't something EA is looking into at the current time.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors last night, during the company's quarterly earnings call. Here, Wilson was asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends.</p>
<p>The EA exec said the "level of innovation and creativity has to continue to scale with the community over time" in order to "maintain growth, and not just maintain size". He noted Apex is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community".</p>

<p>EA understands a "need for meaningful systematic innovation that fundamentally changes the way the game plays", the exec continued, stating the development team is actively working on realising this. When further asked if EA and Respawn would consider an "Apex 2.0" or "a whole studs-up rebuild", Wilson said current trends show a second go at something typically doesn't perform as well as the original.</p><p>Said Wilson: "Typically, what we have seen in the context of live service-driven games at scale is, the 'version two' thing has almost never been as successful as the 'version one' thing. And so actually the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have, and deliver them new, innovative, creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they've made or the investment that they've put into the existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Anytime we cause a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation and creativity, that's never a good place to put our community in."</p>
<p>Wilson said EA and Repsawn's objective is to "continue to innovate in the core experience [as shown in Apex Legend's seasons], and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers". The exec said the team believed it "can do those two things together", and it doesn't "have to separate the experience in order to do so".</p>
<p>Wilson's comments bring to mind Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> series. Despite huge popularity for the original, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-the-moment-overwatch-1-died-forever">pulled Overwatch as it was out of service</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-far-overwatch-2-is-a-clever-but-underwhelming-free-to-play-compromise">replaced it with the free-to-play Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-apologises-still-working-on-overwatch-2-launch-woes">Overwatch 2 users were left unable to play for long periods</a>, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.</p><p>This year, things remain lukewarm for the rejigged shooter, and in February <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">make "major changes" to Overwatch 2</a> as part of a "revitalisation" of the shooter that hoped to "make PvP gameplay more rewarding and fun", as well as "provide greater transparency for players in-game". In May, the developer announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-pve-mode-dropped-after-just-three-months">remove the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from the game three months after it launched</a> as it hadn't "resonated with players".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the same EA call, Wilson said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-a-return-to-what-made-bioware-great-ea-head-says">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a "return to what made BioWare great"</a>.</p>
<p>The company also announced its life-sim game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old">The Sims 4 has managed to gain over 15m new players this year alone</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins-arrive-in-latest-update.1023069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Pocketpair has released a set of seriously spooky&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>Halloween skins, with four of the game's Pals getting terrifying new looks just in time for tomorrow's scarefest.</p>

<p>The update sees Cattiva, Croajiro, Katress, and Pengullet getting different Halloween-themed looks, although in the case of Pengullet, the new skin might be stretching the definition of Halloween a touch.</p>

<p>Cattiva gets a new pumpkin-themed skin, while Croajiro gets an adorable-looking witch outfit. Katress gets some fetching spectacles to complement its already-Halloweeny look, and Pengullet gets a pirate costume. I guess pirates are sort of scary!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=MitaJDNW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=uyDM25Fe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at this little guy. Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>All four of these skins are completely free of charge, and you should receive them the next time you boot up&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, although naturally, you will need to have at least one of the Pals the skins are for in order to reap the benefits.</p>

<p>It's not just the Halloween skins that are coming as part of this update, either. The multiplayer text chat character limit has been "significantly relaxed", so you can now type longer messages to your friends.</p>

<p>Bug fixes, including memory leak patches and a fix for a strange PS5-specific issue wherein a tree would respawn inside a structure that's built over it, have also been implemented. The update is free to download now, so make sure you check it out.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's an open-world survival game with a focus on creature-collecting and base-building.</p>

<p>Developed by Japanese studio Pocketpair, the game was released earlier this year to massive success, passing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">the 25 million player mark</a> just a month or so after its release (although a day-one Game Pass release certainly didn't hurt those numbers).</p>

<p>The game has been remarked upon for its creatures' apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">resemblance to Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, and Nintendo itself has also apparently been taking notice; the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">is suing Pocketpair</a>&nbsp;for "patent infringement".</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can play it as part of Xbox Game Pass if you're a subscriber. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile version is also apparently in development</a> at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton.</p>

                <p>Google is in big (fake) trouble right now, as a Russian fine against it has ballooned to $2.5 decillion over the last couple of years. In case you're wondering, that's $2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 when written out with all 33 zeroes, and when converted, 2 undecillion Russian Rubles. The reason for this astronomical sum being levied against Google? The company blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda channels on YouTube, its video-hosting platform.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/10/2024/671fd2389a794726b01d3af3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RCB</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/russia-has-fined-google-usd2-500-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-or-more-money-than-actually-exists-on-earth-all-because-its-upset-about-some-youtube-channels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Russia originally issued a fine of 100,000 Rubles four years ago after the media outlets Tsargrad and RIA FAN won their lawsuits related to YouTube's channel restrictions, and under state law, the fine doubled for every week that it wasn't paid. The channels were part of the Patriot Media Group that was headed by former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died last year in a mysterious mid-air explosion after his short-lived rebellion against the Russian military leadership.</p><p>That initial fine has ballooned into something impossible to pay off, even for Google, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/alphabet-google/net-assets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which has net assets of over $300 billion</a> as of June 2024. It'd probably need to sell several trillion YouTube Premium subscriptions to get enough cash, but it's highly unlikely that it ever will, nor will it likely pay any of the fine. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Google stopped advertising in the country and its Russian subsidiary declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine had massive ramifications for several games in development, but for one of the most heavily impacted, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornorbyl</a>, the finish line is drawing close after a turbulent period of development.

			<p>A new Red Dead Redemption comparison shared online a few hours ago highlights the differences between the PC and console versions of Rockstar Games' glorious open-world game, which finally made its debut on PC 14 years after its original release.</p>
<p>The comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@geracaopowerup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geração Power Up</a> puts the PC version of the game side by side with the Switch and the Xbox 360 versions of the game, highlighting how the biggest improvement is the higher resolution, which returns a sharp image quality over the other versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption - Graphics Comparison (PC, X360 &amp; SWITCH) | 4K ULTRA HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qQqnp3l8hE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption being essentially the same on PC as it is on consoles, at the very least, ensures it runs well on a variety of system configurations. An RTX 4070 GPU, for example, is capable of running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS at playable framerates, as highlighted in a new video by MxBenchmarkPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption PC | RTX 4070 8K, 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjk6a9CTrEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To see proper visual improvements in Red Dead Redemption PC, we will have to wait for mods. A stunning visual overhaul called <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality Redemption</a> will soon be released for the new version of the game, bringing improvements such as better reflection quality, draw distance for vegetation and map, particles and particle count, and more.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Enjoys Record Q2 Thanks to Live Service Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-enjoys-record-q2-thanks-to-live-service-games.1023033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has enjoyed its most successful second quarter in history, largely thanks to the performance of the company's sports games portfolio.</p>

<p>According to the company's latest <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-FY25-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results presentation</a>, the $2.1 billion in net bookings EA raked in this year sets a record for Q2, with live service games like&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana">driving 74%</a> of those bookings.</p>

<p>The studio notes that its American football offerings are "on track to exceed $1 billion in net bookings" for this fiscal year, demonstrating just how savvy a decision it was for EA to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-deal-covers-4-games">get back into the college football gaming space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=zZkZ3aR_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=-SSBYdR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is having a pretty good year so far, and it has its sports offerings to thank for that.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just sports games, though;&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>is also part of what's made the year so successful for EA so far.</p>

<p>The free-to-play life sim has apparently drawn in more than 15 million players over the past year, although EA doesn't go into detail about how many of those players stuck around or bought anything within the game with real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, those numbers will likely give EA a good reason to be proud of its decision <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">not to pursue&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a>&nbsp;</em>and to focus on development on&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>instead.</p>

<p>It's also no surprise that it's mostly live service offerings that are driving EA's success so far this fiscal year. Since the beginning of April, EA has released precisely one non-live service game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, and that clearly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice">hasn't had the impact</a> the publisher had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=IVWA_k27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=JKu0qDwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA has released one non-live service game so far this fiscal year, and it doesn't seem to have done much to contribute to revenue.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that the reporting period for this fiscal presentation ends on September 30th, which means that whatever sales&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>manages to achieve</a> will be counted in the figures for the third quarter.</p>

<p>EA's record quarter comes after the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">laid off around 5% of its workforce</a> back in February (which technically falls under last fiscal year), cancelling a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>first-person shooter in development at Respawn in the process.</p>

<p>Those layoffs didn't stop CEO Andrew Wilson from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">making more than $25 million</a> last year, but given today's results, I guess we now know why EA's board is so keen on Wilson.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-halloween-run-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland has revealed what’s next on Dying Light 2’s expansive roadmap – a special, limited-time event called ‘Halloween Run’. This event will be delivered alongside update 1.19, and it broadens the Tower Raid mechanic, adds special spooky characters, and introduces new rewards and shop items, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Players dedicated to the game will be able to purchase two new bundles – Cursed Pirate and Count Skull, both of which are bursting with cosmetics that you can don to celebrate Halloween.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-spooky">Get Spooky</h2>



<p>From October 30 to November 20, Dying Light 2 players can participate in an extended Halloween event that’s open to even the newest players just starting their adventure in Villedor.</p>



<p>Each week, Techland will add new features and activities to Dying Light 2, just to keep things fresh. This content injection introduces a terrifying Tower Raid loop, new bounties themed on Halloween, and more cosmetics and new rewards than you can shake a pumpkin (?) at.</p>



<p>Players taking part in the Tower Raid can pick from four unique classes, each of which has traits specific to that character. It boosts the replayability factor of Halloween Run, which is great for players hungry to grind. </p>



<p>With Patch 1.19, the Techland team has also introduced a new control scheme that makes controlling firearms much more satisfying and intuitive. That’s along with the typical quality-of-life improvements and community-led changes that you’d expect with an update like this.</p>



<p>In the patch notes, Techland confirmed that some of the most niggling issues in Dying Light 2 have been addressed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op spawning in Tower Raid</li>



<li>Broken quests and soft lock issues</li>



<li>Improved physics for certain heavy skills</li>



<li>Tweaked filter presets</li>



<li>Replaced missing dialogue and subtitles in some quests</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you looking forward to sinking your teeth into Dying Light 2’s Halloween Run update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-xmg-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you want to use a weapon in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> that is easy to control and has enough bullets to go on a killing spree, then you must choose the XMG. It’s an LMG and here are the best attachments, Perks, and Equipment you can use along with it to make a solid loadout.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best XMG loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike other weapons where five attachments are more than enough, I recommend using eight attachments for the XMG – thanks to the Gunfighter Perk. </p>



<p>Start with the <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> as it’s clean enough to land your headshots accurately. The <strong>Suppressor</strong> suppresses the gun sound and also hides you from the mini-map.</p>



<p>The <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> will greatly increase the damage range and bullet velocity of the XMG thereby improving the weapon’s firepower. The <strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will slightly increase Sprinting Movement Speed and Horizontal Recoil Control.</p>



<p>Yes, the <strong>Fast Mag II</strong> will significantly reduce the ammo capacity of the magazine but in return, you are getting quicker reloads, better ADS, and Sprint to Fire Speeds. The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> comes in handy with a further improved Aim Down Sight speed.</p>



<p>Combine that with the <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> and your Aim Walking Movement Speed will also increase significantly while using the XMG. Lastly, <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> will be the cherry on top as it slightly improves both horizontal and vertical recoil of the LMG. </p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for XMG</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Combining <strong>Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time</strong> will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> Specialty as it grants a temporary buff to movement speed and health regeneration rate – a combination that goes well with the XMG</p>



<p>For the Wildcard, use <strong>Gunfighter</strong> as it will enable you to use eight attachments on your XMG. The sacrifice you’re making here is letting go of the fourth Perk slot (Perk Greed helps you achieve that) but it’s worth it.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shot</strong> should be your go-to Equipment choices here for quick damage and health recovery. Lastly, keep the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> and place them wisely for cheeky free kills.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the XMG are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the XMG by reaching <strong>player level 13</strong> in Black Ops 6. This should be fairly easy as it won’t take a lot of time to unlock the weapon and you can start leveling it up early in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Despite the XMG being a heavy weapon, you get a very fast TTK from it. On top of that, controlling the weapon is easy due to its low recoil, allowing you to easily spray down enemies at long ranges.</p>



<p>The only downsides of this weapon are its slow mobility and ADS speeds but the attachments I’ve recommended above should get that sorted.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the XMG is too much for you, then the best alternatives are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. These two weapons are two of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Assault Rifles in BO6</a> as they are ruling the meta right now, offering fast TTK similar to the LMG.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has released its first-ever blockchain game, the tactical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-first-ever-blockchain-game">company announced the game last June</a> after years of dabbling in blockchain, but has only now quietly launched it.</p>
<p>The game is on PC and free to start, though players can purchase figurines with which to battle using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency. These figurines are NFTs and can be bought on the <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace?sort=price_desc">game's marketplace</a> from anywhere between $7 to $64,000 (almost £50k).</p>

<p>It appears to be possible to play the game without purchasing figurines, though those willing to pay the extortionate prices will surely have more success in battles.</p>
<p>Battles themselves are turn-based affairs against other players with squads of three figurines.</p>
<p>Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">IGN</a> the game "offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations", comparing it to a physical trading card game.</p>
<p>Here's the statement in full: "The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis - much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together."</p>
<p>Ubisoft did not comment on the game's Adults Only rating, presumably for its blockchain basis and use of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Back in December 2021, Ubisoft launched its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">NFT platform called Quartz</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a> Breakpoint as the first game to offer a beta trial. It did not fare well, appearing to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">initially only sold 15 NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-nft-bosses-say-players-just-dont-get-it">Ubisoft's NFT bosses stated in an interview afterwards</a> that players just "don't get it".</p>
<p>It's interesting, therefore, for Ubisoft to have still released this project, considering other developers have slowly backpedalled on their enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>That includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-seemingly-backtracks-from-earlier-nft-enthusiasm">EA boss Andrew Wilson</a>, after describing NFTs as "an important part of… the future of our industry".</p>
<p>"I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players," he later said during an earnings call in February 2022.</p>
<p>"Whether that's part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we're going to - we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it's not something that we're driving audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo subsidiary Mario Club Co., Ltd. isn't laying off employees.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://leakpress.net/2024/10/74/">Leakpress</a> claimed Mario Club Co., Ltd. was letting go of approximately 150 of its 400 employees. It was said the layoffs were happening across various groups within the company.</p>

<p>However, in the time since this initial report, Nintendo has debunked these claims. In a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"We have confirmed with Mario Club Co., Ltd. that the rumoured information in the report is untrue."</p>
<p>Mario Club Co., Ltd. is a game-testing and debugging team for many of Nintendo's games. Its credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/princess-peach-showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> and Super Mario Bros.

<p>The initial report claiming layoffs at Mario Club Co., Ltd. said the condition was a little different from so-called 'eviction rooms', which is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-reportedly-cuts-japanese-workforce-but-denies-pressuring-voluntary-leave">Bandai Namco was recently accused of</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported Bandai Namco staff were not being laid off directly, but were rather being sent to rooms with nothing to do. Essentially, the company was said to be putting pressure on staff to resign voluntarily, to avoid having to formally lay them off.</p><p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-wii-u-exclusive-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-coming-to-nintendo-switch">company announced Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, a souped up version of the acclaimed 2015 sci-fi action-RPG released on Wii U, which will bring enhanced visuals and more on its Nintendo Switch release next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition comparison video was shared online, highlighting the differences between the new version of the game launching next year and the original Wii U release.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by ElAnalistaDeBits highlights how the Definitive Edition of the game will feature improved character models, textures, lighting, and shadows. Judging from the video, the enhancements aren't as big as those seen in Xenoblade<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-essential-for-jrpg-fans/">&nbsp;Chronicles: Definitive Edition</a>, but that was to be expected, considering the first entry in the series was originally released on the Wii.</p>

<p>Besides visual improvements, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will feature some sort of new story content, as teased in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-launching-20-march-2025/">reveal trailer</a> shared yesterday, which featured an alternate version of the post-credit scene from the original. As the game is the only entry in the series with no relation to the other games, it wouldn't be surprising for the mysterious hooded figure seen in the new scene to bridge the gap with the other games.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches on March 20th, 2025 on Nintendo Switch. More information on some of the game's unique features, such as the ability to create a custom avatar and ride massive mechs called Skells on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-brings-an-expansive-sci-fi-adventure-to-nintendo-switch-on-march-20/">Nintendo's official website.</a></p>

            <p>"Worthless,’ they'd declared. Most NFTs were ‘worthless.’ The greatest artistic movement since The Big BSoD, the greatest proof of the power of the blockchain, the very future of the whole funging Infobahn, and the hedgie soybean-counters say it's all ‘worthless’," once wrote the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-nfts-are-worthless-how-come-i-have-written-a-third-novel-about-nfts-saving-the-future">greatest living prophet of our era</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-her-movie/">once again </a>asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">Ian Games</a> for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, which I won’t link because I respect the colour green too much, is “the ultimate Web3 competitive Turn-Based RPG”. You can only play the game via its own website, which I won’t link to because I respect the colour green too much. There’s also a trailer floating around. Not going to link to that either. Got a lot of respect for ‘things in motion’, I have, and this represents a terrible use of them.</p>
<p>As IGN point out, Ubisoft first announced it’d be sticking its head in the NFToilet bowl and daintily sampling the yellowing side-cruft about three years back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">in an earnings call</a>. Words like ‘revolution’ were used. The phrase ‘play-to-earn’ was latched on to with glee. "[Blockchain] will imply more play-to-earn that will enable more players to actually earn content, own content, and we think it's going to grow the industry quite a lot," chirpy cockney urchin Yves Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>Contrast this to statements made by Ubisoft’s Philippe Tremblay to<a href="http://gi.biz/"> GI.biz earlier this year</a>, where the director of subscriptions said that a consumer shift "needs to happen" re: "Gamers are used to owning their games". Sure, blockchain and subscription-based access are different kettles of fish, but this does feel inconsistent. It’s almost like they’ll just say anything! Why even use words anymore! Why not just chortle and snort! You know you want to!</p>
<p>If you slept through or somehow mercifully forgot about the crypto craze of the last few years, you might be wondering why a game that lets you buy items as NFTs is a problem. First up, there’s the obvious pay-to-win element attendant on letting people cough up to forge more powerful characters - something that irks me less because of the holy sanctity of competitive game balance (although that’s enough to put me off playing), and more because these things are designed to play off the same vulnerabilities as gambling.</p>
<p>IGN report that the highest priced figurines - the characters you use to battle - are up on the marketplace at $63k. That doesn’t mean people are necessarily paying this much, mind, and those are outliers - most bits are a mere $300. Either way, it seems antithetical to anything actually interesting or valuable about game design. Why inspire organic investment when you can just invite players to join in a ghoulish sunk-cost spiral?</p>
<p>Secondly, the web3 industry have thus far failed to make a convincing case that this stuff isn’t a complete emissions disaster. <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">According to one study</a>, Bitcoin alone uses the same amount of electricity each year as Argentina. For balance, I should point out that blockchain advocates argue that the technology can aid sustainability via “more accurate load monitoring, generation, and distribution in the grid through efficient use of data,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/">via Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>It's also hard to see the release of Champions Tactics right now as anything but an act of desperation from a Ubisoft evidently feeling financial pressure, or at least trying to get those numbers up before a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">potential buyout</a>.</p>
<p>I leave you with more words of wisdom from RPS’s dearly departed scryer of crud:</p>
<p>"A crack revealing strata of vape pens, LaserDiscs, and bags for life. All of it, trash. The melted bumper of the weed-green Tesla Model X once owned by... she couldn't even say his name. Everything, trash. Two empty bottles of Irn-Bru Kombucha rising like the legs of Ozymandias. 5arah snorted. <em>Look on my apes, ye Mighty, and despair!</em>"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Sony has closed Concord studio Firewalk</a>, the live-service game's initial development deal reportedly cost $200m.</p>
<p>This, however, was not enough to cover the game's entire development costs, sources familiar with the agreement told <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">Kotaku</a>. This cost also did not include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">Sony acquired last year</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday's news detailed the human cost of closing the studio, which employed around 150-170 people. The $200m figure adds a sense of the financial cost of even beginning development.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-reportedly-cost-300m-to-make-amid-a-culture-of-toxic-positivity">report from September</a>, after the game was shut down, suggested the game had cost $400m to produce, with development rife with "toxic positivity".</p>
<p>A final statement from Firewalk shared last night on social media details what the studio achieved during its time on Concord.</p>
<p>"Firewalk began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience," reads the statement.</p>
<p>The assembled team then grew a new startup, the statement continues, built a "customised next-generation FPS engine", managed an acquisition from Sony, and ultimately delivered "a great FPS experience to players - even if it landed much more narrowly than hoped against a heavily consolidated market".</p>

<p>"We took some risks along the way - marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters - and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward," the statement continues.</p><p>"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.  Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way."</p>
<p>Despite this hard work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">Concord reportedly sold only 25,000 copies</a> - clearly not enough to recoup its huge costs. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled offline at the start of September</a>.</p>
<p>"The PvP first-person shooter genre is a competitive space that's continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," wrote SIE boss Hermen Hulst in an internal email shared yesterday. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Sony’s remaster strategy remains a little baffling for ardent gamers, now that we’re firmly in an age of backward compatibility. You could argue that there’s clearly diminishing returns in graphical advancements, but they wouldn’t be sticking with this plan if it wasn’t showing some benefits. From Spider-Man Remastered to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/">The Last of Us Part I</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn</a> and now Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, there’s a layered reasoning for each release. They bring the games back to the forefront of discussion and release schedules, nudge sticker prices back up a notch, tie in with TV and movie projects, and more. And with games now taking longer than ever to make, they’re good projects to let developers gain experience, try out new techniques, push the envelope a little further while the sequel’s production is still going through the gears.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMN-x9goE7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the case of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/01/sony-acquires-pc-porting-specialists-nixxes-software/">Sony’s PC porting specialists at Nixxes</a> taking on a very different job, in partnership with Guerrilla Games, broadening the scope of what that studio is charged with doing for a full remaster in the latest iteration of the Decima Engine. While Nixxes was able to automate some parts of this, dropping new replacement assets in place with systemic changes, an awful lot has required a manual pass and complete overhauls with new techniques.</p>


<p>This could have come at the cost of performance, but thankfully it really hasn’t. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered offers 30fps, 40fps (on a 120Hz screen) and 60fps modes, and there’s going to be some trade-offs here, but I felt like the 60fps performance mode looked absolutely fantastic. It matches the frame rate that the original game can get when played on PS5, but brings all the improvements we’re about to delve into, keeps a high resolution and has higher-quality anti-aliasing and upscaling. The frame rate and resolution metrics will only be pushed further with the PS5 Pro, which this game natively supports.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest change and improvement is an overhaul for many of the conversations and dialogues in the game. This was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">one of the weakest aspects of the original release in 2017</a>, with particularly stilted-looking animations for a lot of dialogue and fixed camera angles that lacked the dynamism of the rest of the game. To improve this, they’ve gone back to the motion capture stage, grabbing new motion capture with which to liven up the thousands of dialogue elements in the game, and going through a bunch of rather complicated steps to feed those back in place.</p>


<p>The end result is worth the effort, as you go from the very workmanlike style of the original to something much closer to Horizon Forbidden West, and it’s seemingly across the board. Even relatively straightforward chats with a simple side quest giver now has the camera pulled back a bit, the opportunity for more upper body movement, more nuanced facial animation and character expression. It doesn’t change the story, of course, but it makes its delivery a smidgeon more engaging.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Nixxes has gone through the game with a fine-tooth comb to find other places to improve. The world lighting has been updated to use some of the techniques from the PS5-exclusive expansion Burning Shores, but there’s also needed the world lighting to be be redone by hand, just to try and match the same mood of the original with the fidelity of its sequel. The snow effects from the Frozen Wilds DLC have been applied to all snowy regions in the game, and there’s now the ability for a snow shader to build up on characters, and screen-space reflections help streams and bodies of water look so much better.</p>

<p>In general, it’s the lighting that can lead to the most striking differences. To give just one example, if you head down to the densely wooded, jungle-like biome to the south of the world map, the depth of colour feels much greater, the shadow darker and the streams of light and robot-induced lens flair all the more impactful.</p>
<p>The team also highlighted key areas, such as the ground of Meridian City, that were completely redone, the manual pass to manmade structures, the new skin shaders for character models to match Horizon Forbidden West –&nbsp;characters have that peach fuzz of hair to their skin, for example – and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>Some of these are very fine tweaks that you’ll barely have a chance to notice while sprinting through the world, and will stake a good long look to really appreciate when comparison set scenes and stills. What I will say is that Meridian City does definitely feel more lively than it does in the original. There is maybe a doubling of NPC counts for the same time of day, adding a bit more of the hustle and bustle that you might expect in a capital city.</p>

I’ve seen a few characters spin on the spot, as they encounter other characters walking toward them, children walk through someone else’s legs, and instead of sticking to paths, they might clamber over rocks alongside.</p>
<p>That, then goes to highlight some of the occasionally wacky physics that clothes can have, whether it’s Erend’s chunky armour flapping up over his legs while walking, or capes and cloaks of background character whipping around when there’s camera cuts during dialogue. Hair is seemingly less susceptible to this now, or at least in Aloy’s case.</p>
<p>As impressive as all of this is, though…. I’m pleasantly surprised with how well Horizon Zero Dawn still holds up. Sure, an awful lot of people would have played this game originally on base PS4, but PS4 Pro gave a lot of enhancements just from the jump up in resolution and checkerboarding, and a patch was released a few years ago that allowed the game to run at 4K checkerboarding with 60FPS on PS5. That level of performance on PS5 is fantastic.</p>
<p>It makes this upgrade feel rather inessential…. the saving grace being that upgrading on this occasion is rather cheap. Anyone that owns the original game, whether that’s the base game, the complete edition, or the freebie handout during Days of Play, can pay $10 for a pretty decent visual overhaul, and return to Aloy’s original adventure with a smattering of new finery.</p>

            <p>The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">can be thin</a>, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. "Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nc88_ZEfxg">Lionel Hutz</a> that quote: "Nazis? I hate <em>these</em> guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.</p>
<p>I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.</p><!--more-->
<p>I saw this on the start-up screen during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-redefines-the-gun-toting-archaeologist-as-a-grabby-lucasfilm-fanboi">my hands-on with the game</a> a few weeks ago. I meant to email for a copy of the text and write it up, but I forgot, and then those chancers at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/">Gamespot</a> did an article, so here I am playing Journo Come Lately. Here's the disclaimer in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a fictional story, inspired by historical events and characters. Names, characters, organizations, locations, and events are either imaginary or depicted in a fictionalized manner, not intended to disrespect any historical or cultural beliefs.</p>
<p>The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's likely just the usual legal arse-covering, of course. The game itself might be bruisingly frank about the fash, but there's nothing to stop an opportunistic far-right chowderhead cherry-picking a screenshot or video for the sake of a meme, or modding the game to let you play as the goose-steppers.</p><p>It's also possible the disclaimer is designed to ensure compliance with Germany's <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/germany-lifted-its-ban-on-nazi-imagery-in-video-games-thats-great.html">qualified lifting of prohibitions on depictions of Nazis in video games back in 2018</a>, following which "symbols of unconstitutional organisations can be used in games in individual cases, as long as those symbols serve an artistic or scientific purpose, or depict current or historical events."</p>
<p>Still, it does look a bit ridiculous. This is Indiana Jones! I'm curious about whether the developers have any internal guidance about how to avoid counter-intuitively glorifying Nazis while teaching you to beat them to death. I guess you could argue that Indiana Jones And The Great Circle might inadvertently build a little sympathy given that it is basically a Third Reich Bullying Simulator.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-a-return-to-what-made-bioware-great-ea-head-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is a "return to what made BioWare great".</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A with investors in EA's quarterly earnings call, Wilson reflected on BioWare's recent history, which included looking back at beleaguered multiplayer shooter, Anthem.</p>
<p>The EA exec said this game was "probably the one people remember the most for not really living up to the expectations of what a 'BioWare game' should be". He noted the studio was trying to "do something very very different" to what had gone before, adding the "pieces of the puzzle" ultimately didn't come together as BioWare had hoped.</p>

</figure>
<p>Following Anthem, a "big shift" subsequently happened at the developer, which Wilson said saw the studio "really returning to BioWare-type games" and "returning to BioWare's strengths". And, that brings us to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is set to release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on 31st October.</p><p>"The BioWare team has really rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favourite studio and a fan-favourite brand and the types of games they make; incredibly rich worlds, incredibly nuanced characters, really powerful and compelling stories with camaraderie and friendships and relationships, and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay," Wilson said.</p>
<p>"And I think it’s been that return to what made BioWare great and giving the studio the time to deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age world is what amounts to a game like Dragon Age: The Veilguard."</p>

<p>We recently awarded Dragon Age: The Veilguard five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-out-now-on-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Pokémon TCG Pocket, the digital trading card game, is now available on mobile.</p>
<p>It's free-to-start and allows players to split open booster packs to acquire digital versions of popular Pokémon trading cards - and then compete in battles.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-heading-to-mobile-this-year">first announced at the Pokémon Presents event in February</a> and is now finally available to download across iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p>One of the biggest draws are the "immersive cards" that allow players to dive into the artwork to explore the worlds within.</p>
<p>However, while free-to-start, there are microtransactions and multiple currencies in the store to acquire time boosters and other items, allowing players to open more packs.</p>
<p>Poké Gold costs 79p for five pieces, or up to £79.99 for 500 pieces. This can be used to buy bundles of items, costing from 45 pieces to 115 pieces.</p>
<p>That said, there are various freebies each day so, if you're willing to wait, you'll still have access to a decent chunk of the experience without paying - so far at least.</p>
<p>At launch, cards are from the Genetic Apex collection, which includes plenty of fan favourite Pokémon originating from the Kanto region.</p>
<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn went hands-on with the experience</a> stating while the focus is on opening card packs "there's a promising version of the card game underneath".</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is expected to be a success, though it remains to be seen if it can reach the same levels as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.</p>
<p>That game just launched its Gigantamax feature to a mixed response, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gigantamax-battles-will-be-made-easier-in-response-to-mixed-feedback">Niantic acknowledging feedback to make the battles easier</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
