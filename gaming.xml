            <p>
Hidden away on NASA's <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/voyager-golden-record/">Golden Record</a>, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, <a href="https://fleursdumal.org/poem/102">Élévation</a>, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

<p>
I'm shamelessly piggybacking on my own academic research here. But look, it's on point. Three Verses is a grid-based first-person "typing RPG" in which you help poets finish their poems by asking various gods to supply the concluding line. "You" being a disembodied soul seeking elevation from a purgatory of royalty-free, PS1-style spaces - washed, pixel-scabbed streets tormented by metronomic trains, interiors made up of soiled slabs and motel doors. Not vast, but certainly sorrowful and vexing. Oh, and hovering synthwave mazes. And minigames featuring bubbled green cats and chunky dice. Your equipment consists of a pop-up organiser for note-taking, with phrases manually typed in. Typing is also how you'll cast spells during simple turn-based battles with creatures like door-blocking gargoyles.
</p>
<p>
The poems themselves - all awaiting recombination, with no obvious opportunity to improvise or deviate so far - aren't original to Three Verses. As detailed on <a href="https://d-mag.itch.io/three-verses">the Itch page</a>, which includes a free version of the game, they're lifted from Brion Gysin's Permuted Poems and Robert Ashley's TV performance Perfect Lives: an opera, among other texts. As such, the game is something of a restless archive that triangulates some interesting links between various literary traditions, a cousin of the Golden Record that, again, invites the recipient to resolve or toy with the gaps. I played about 30 minutes of the Itch demo yesterday and got stuck in a puzzle maze involving sewer valves. I'd like to play more, perhaps after it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3139120/THREE_VERSES/">launches on Steam</a>. Now, what would be the most obvious and obnoxious way to finish this article. Ah, of cour

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> 64 is now available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.</p>
<p>Up until now, the arcade racer - the first Ridge Racer game to come to a Nintendo-flavoured console - was only playable for those who still have a Nintendo 64 hooked up.</p>

<p>Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo states this "arcade classic" takes you on "fast-paced races across three different environments for a total of nine courses".</p>
<p>"Dive right in with Quick Play to race three laps around the Revolution Novice course or take on Grand Prix and choose any available track to test your skills," the blurb teases. </p>
<p>"Other modes include Car Attack, which lets you compete for better cars, and Time Attack, where the only thing you're racing against is your own best time! Challenge your friends in Multiplayer and put the pedal to the metal in three modes: Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode."</p>
<p>Last week we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-three-more-snes-games-promising-puzzles-brawls-and-ninjas">Nintendo added another three classic games to its SNES Switch Online collection</a>, including one not seen in the west before: Fatal Fury 2, and Super Ninja Boy.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, Nintendo Switch Online is Nintendo's answer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus</a>. </p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-must-pay-to-play-nintendo-switch-online-from-next-week">launched back in 2018</a>, and marks the first time Nintendo has locked the ability to play multiplayer games online behind a paid service.

			<p>Sony angered a lot of PC gamers when it demanded that players register for a PlayStation account in order to play some of their ports, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-will-soon-require-a-psn-account-even-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a>, just to name a few. It wasn't just a matter of not wanting to create another account beyond those required to actually purchase the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store; there's also the simple fact that some countries aren't even supported by PlayStation Network accounts, which made those games impossible to get there.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears that Sony has finally heard all the negative feedback on the subject. Four big single player games, two already released, one just released, and another due soon, won't require a PSN account on PC anymore. Instead, Sony is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implementing</a> some exclusive bonuses for those who choose to connect their PSN accounts anyway.</p>

		<p>Another mainstay Xbox franchises is coming to PlayStation, With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> set to release for PS5 this spring.</p>
<p>The port is being developed by Panic Button in collaboration with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games, and will be like-for-like in terms of content with all the previously released car pack, and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-review/">Hot Wheels</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/24/forza-horizon-5-rally-adventure-expansion-revealed/">Rally Adventure</a> expansions also available.</p>


<p>This follows on from comments by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who said in the last few weeks that “To keep games off other platforms… it’s not a path for us.” This certainly tied in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/">the latest rumours</a> that had other core Xbox franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag-microsoft-flight-simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> potentially coming to PlayStation, and with Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-confirmed-for-may/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/rumours-grow-of-starfield-indiana-jones-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5/">Indiana Jones</a>, and Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> already confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 Review (Xbox Series X in 4K 60fps)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEl0KBy5I-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is the latest in Playground Games’ spectacular open world arcade racing spin-off to the main Forza Motorsport series. Where previous games took us to Australia and the UK, Forza Horizon 5 takes players to a gorgeous approximation of Mexico, really showcasing the variety of environments that you can find in the country.</p>

<p>Originally released in late 2021 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC, t<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/halo-infinite-20-million-players-forza-horizon-5-18-million-but-how-many-bought-the-games/">he game set records for Xbox Game Pass at the time</a>. It’s over three years old now, and has had countless updates, car packs and a pair of great expansions as well. PlayStation 5 owners are in for a treat when it arrives.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Horizon 5 review</a>, we scored the sequel a sublime 9 out of 10 with Dom saying, “Forza Horizon 5 continues the series’ legacy, usurping Forza Horizon 4 as the new pinnacle of open-world racing and as a graphical showcase for the new generation of Xbox console.”</p>

He thought he could stare at a light burning the question “Who is alive?” (the title of the episode) into his eyes and the afterimage would last long enough that his Innie would momentarily be able to see it. He gets an F for effort from us, and thankfully some helpful advice from Regabhi (Karen Aldridge), the former Lumon employee who helped Petey (Yul Vazquez) reintegrate.</p><p>After letting him know that the severance switch dilating his pupils would mean the afterimage would be erased, that going this route could blind him, and that Innie Mark would have no way of communicating back to him, she tells him his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) was alive the last time she saw her. Then, she gives him one glimmer of hope of reconnecting with her: reintegration.</p><p>The last time we heard about reintegration was when Petey described it to Mark as “having two different lives suddenly stitched together” in Season 1. Unfortunately for Petey, his reintegration led to hallucinations of his past on the Severed Floor and in his present in the outside world, frequent nosebleeds, crippling paranoia, and his eventual death in a convenience store bathroom. Those reintegration scenes were heartbreaking because you could see a man struggling to trust who he is at any given moment, showing the most devastating effects of the severance process. </p><p>Regabhi assures Mark she’s improved her reintegration process, and we get our first glimpse of how this mysterious procedure works. She wires Mark up to a complex arrangement of equipment that monitors his brainwaves while asking him a series of questions to see when his Innie memory merges with his Outie’s. The Mark from the outside could probably tell you his date of birth instantly, but the Innie Mark would have no idea. That’s why him forgetting and then later implying he only knows time by business quarters were signs of his reintegration working. Then, we see his first memory at Lumon—him being interviewed by Petey the same way he interviewed Helly R (Britt Lower) on her first day—but this time his clothes glitch between his Severed Floor attire and his present-day attire, and his environment switches between Regabhi’s basement and Lumon. For a second, we see a severed employee dressed in their severed attire in the outside world. Reintegration is complete...somewhat.</p><p>The show exploring reintegration with a character it showed us was indispensable to Lumon in last week’s episode could mean we see the first Innie-Outie team-up on <em>Severance</em>. Regabhi does say the only way to get information in and out of the Severed Floor is through reintegration, so we could see the lengths of reintegration’s powers. </p><p>With Innie Dylan George (Zach Cherry) spending time with his Outie’s wife in the Family Visitation Center, Helly R’s mysterious behavior prompting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/s/Ugd4dzH6UH&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/s/Ugd4dzH6UH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit message boards</a></span> to question if it’s really her, and now Mark reintegrating, this season of <em>Severance </em>is quickly shaping up to be one in which the inseparability of the Innies and the Outies leads to the truth coming out...for better or worse. Let’s just hope Mark doesn’t bleed out at Pip’s.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The streamer announced the news <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1861071895484879274">via social media</a> and <a href="https://corp.rumble.com/blog/dr-disrespect-will-lead-rumble-gaming-join-rumble-premium/">Rumble confirmed it in a press release</a>, stating that the streamer will provide a mix of free and paid content for the platform as well as “acting as an advisor and helping to build the Rumble Gaming community.”</p><p>The move to Rumble is the latest development in the Dr Disrespect streaming saga that began four years ago. In 2020, Dr Disrespect, whose real name is Herschel “Guy” Beahm, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch with little explanation</a> mere months after signing a multi-million dollar exclusivity deal. Earlier this year, <em>The Verge</em> and other outlets broke the news that the reason for his ban was due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">inappropriate conversations Beahm had with a minor</a>. Beahm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185821/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation-inappropriate-messages">denied any wrongdoing</a> stating that there were no “real intentions” behind the messages. He then took a two-month break before returning to stream on YouTube. In response to the allegations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">YouTube suspended monetization on his channel</a> and his membership in YouTube’s partner program and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/26/youtube-rejects-dr-disrespects-application-to-re-monetize/">denied his appeal to re-monetize his channel</a> late last month.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305606/dr-disrespect-rumble-streaming-youtube-twitch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjMxNjI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">YouTube is stopping Dr Disrespect’s channel from making money</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by David Becker / Getty Images</cite></p></div><div><p>Dr Disrespect’s YouTube channel has been demonetized.

            <p>
Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by controversial streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm, is shutting its doors, four months after making "significant" layoffs. The news comes as Google announces it's lifting Beahm's YouTube monetisation ban, which was put in place following his admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last year.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society was founded by Beahm and former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021, and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-footage-of-deadrop-from-the-nft-fuelled-developer-backed-by-dr-disrespect">announced its first title</a> - free-to-play vertical extraction shooter Deaddrop - the following year. Development on Deadrop has continued since then, but 2024 proved challenging for the studio amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm's admission</a> he exchanged "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".
</p>
<p>
Bowling and Midnight Society were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">quick to distance themselves from Beahm</a> when the allegations around his behaviour first surfaced, but the studio was seemingly unable to weather the resulting storm. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-studio-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs-due-to-multiple-unexpected-challenges">announced "significant" layoffs in September</a>, blaming "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months." And now Midnight Society is shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Today, we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of 55 developers contributing to our new IP Deadrop," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160">statement shared on social media</a>, adding it is "actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members."
</p>
<p>
"We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members," the developer concluded, "and [are] deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal."
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society's closure coincides with the news Google has lifted its suspension preventing Beahm from monetising his YouTube channel. The channel was initially demonetised following Beahm's admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last June, and Google chose to uphold that suspension following an appeal in October - despite Beahm's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-returns-insisting-conversations-with-minor-were-inappropriate-jokes-taken-out-of-context">attempts to backtrack on his statement</a> a month earlier, when he began referring to the messages as "jokes". Now, however, Google has announced a reversal of its decision.
</p><p>
"DrDisrepsect was previously suspended from the YouTube Partner Program for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lgykx4q7zc2k">statement shared by Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a> . "Creators who are suspended from this program can reapply for access, and after careful review of the channel's recent activity, we've reinstated it. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action." Google did not specify what had changed since last year's appeal.
</p>
<p>
"What a fucking weird world, huh?", Beahm said in a stream following YouTube's reversal (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">Kotaku</a>). "On the day that Midnight Society closes, we get monetisation. What a fucking trip."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-crys-animated-netflix-series-gets-april-release-date-and-a-limp-bizkit-opener<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been a long time coming - seven years, in fact - but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaption of Devil May Cry is almost upon us. The streaming service has announced the series premieres on 3rd April, and there's a trailer of sorts to accompany the news.
</p>
<p>
We first heard a Devil May Cry animated adaptation was in the works back in 2018, with Adi Shankar - executive producer on Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation and 2023's Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - tasked with teasing it into existence.
</p>
<p>
For a while it seemed like the project might have been quietly shelved, but 2023 proved otherwise, bringing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-look-at-netflixs-long-in-the-works-devil-may-cry-animated-series">first look at the show</a>, alongside confirmation its animation was being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind The Legend of Korra.

<p>
A year later, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-anime-launches-2025-and-everything-else-from-netflix-geek-week">released its first proper trailer</a> for the series, providing a glimpse of a Dante displaying little enthusiasm for buttoning up his shirts. That reveal also pointed to an April 2025 release, which has now been narrowed right down to April 3rd.
</p><p>
Netflix's release date news is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4V6H0LFEGs">accompanied by a trailer</a> showcasing the Devil May Cry series' intro sequence, complete with strikingly stylised violence and a Limp Bizkit soundtrack. It's a lot different to the actual show, of course, which adopts a more traditional anime-style aesthetic.
</p>
<p>

We still don't have any story details for this animated version of Devil May Cry yet - beyond 'white-haired young man in red jacket loves to show off his abs - but presumably Netflix'll have more to say about the series ahead of its arrival.

<div><p>Today we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of over 55 developers contributing to our new IP DEADROP.</p><p>We are actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members.</p><p>If you know anyone who’s hiring please forward this message to them or DM us for direct intros.</p><p>We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members and deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal.</p></div>

<p>Midnight Society was originally founded by Robert Bowling of Call of Duty fame and content creator Dr Disrespect. However, following a series of allegations being levelled at the streamer last year, it was announced that Dr Disrespect would no longer be working at the studio.</p>



<p>After those events unfolded, Midnight Society’s leadership team insisted that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was little more than an influencer and marketer for the brand, but the shamed streamer claimed he was much more important to the project. Could his removal from the company have been a factor in this house of cards collapsing in on itself?</p>



<p>DEADROP was poised to be a ‘vertical extraction shooter’ fused with the blockchain and featuring NFT-driven mechanics. In a series of ‘snippets’ released during the game’s development cycle, players were invited to get early access to the title – myself included – and it wasn’t anything to write home about.</p>

Several DLC pack collections are on the way for those who plan to stick with the seventh entry in the long-running strategy series in the months ahead, with things like additional Leaders, Civilizations, and Natural Wonders set to be included. Alongside the paid drops arriving in the spring and summer, players can expect free Civilization 7 content to launch via patches, events, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Headlining the paid DLC is a two-part release called the Crossroads of the World Collection. Part one launches in early March and comes with Leader Ada Lovelace, four Natural Wonders, and the Carthage and Great Britain Civs, while part two is set to arrive in late March with Leader Simon Bollvar and Civs Bulgaria and Nepal. Free content is also expected to release in early and late March, too, with the month split up between the new Natural Wonder Battle event and Bermuda Triangle Natural Wonder in the first half and the Marvelous Mountains event and Mount Everest Natural Wonder in the second half.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">March is set up to kick off Civilization 7 post-launch support with a strong start, but there's more set arrive later in the year. Firaxis says the Right Rule Collection will launch sometime this summer, bringing two new leaders, four new Civs, and four New World Wonders. The April through September window will also see the release of more free content and updates. It's a promising roadmap (below) that has the 2K Games strategy-focused developer promising to deliver more post-launch support from October 2025 "and beyond." Specific release dates for everything revealed today have yet to be announced.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/30/civilization-7-roadmap-1738266667768.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sid Meier's Civilization 7 post-launch roadmap includes paid and free content updates for 2025 and beyond.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis revealed even more plans in a recently published <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/dev-diary/victories-post-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer diary blog post</a>, which includes the promise to add teams to multiplayer games, increased multiplayer lobby sizes, additional map variety, and even modding tools. The team explains that it will release features like these "as soon as we can."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first set of updates we'll be providing are those that directly target the game as it currently stands," the dev diary explains. "There will be some bugs to fix, plenty of balance changes to make, and we know there are spots in the gameplay and user interface that can be enhanced with any number of quality-of-life improvements. You'll see regular updates from us in all of these areas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to a breakdown of how Firaxis will tackle Civilization 7 post-launch content, the livestream gave fans a closer look at how all of its systems work together in multiplayer. The hour-and-a-half-long gameplay presentation saw creative director Ed Beach take on senior designer Tim Flemming live to show off how two different strategies can be used to achieve victory regardless of whether you’re playing alone or against others. Today’s stream, Firaxis’ last before launch, also included Q&amp;A sections where the team answered some of the community's questions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-release-date-announced-gameplay-trailer-revealed-gamescom-2024"><u>launches</u></a> for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S February 11.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-the-final-preview-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On day three of my visit to Capcom in Osaka, Japan, I once again sat in a dimly lit conference room. I was playing Monster Hunter Wilds, empty cans of coffee and tea strewn around my station. “You must be tired of being stuck in here playing,” said a friendly employee. All I could think was: “I wish I could play more.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is after I played the first five hours of Monster Hunter Wild’s story and hunted four monsters in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-meet-nu-udra-apex-of-the-oilwell-basin-ign-first">Oilwell Basin</a> in a different play state. I just couldn’t get enough; there are so many nuances to master with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-developers-talk-weapon-changes-ign-first">new weapon and gameplay features</a> and I’m the type of person who wants to scrutinize everything and figure out exactly how everything works through repetition and experimentation. I’m a guides writer - it comes with the territory - but because of my limited time, I needed to focus on the main story. That’s fine. After this hands-on, I know I’ll enthusiastically spend hundreds more hours in the game once it’s out. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is Monster Hunter Getting Easier, or Are You Just Better?</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I beelined it through the story to make sure I could see every monster there was to see, and in doing so, I didn’t make optimized equipment; instead, I crafted and upgraded what I could as I went. That’s the basic loop of Monster Hunter: Hunt monster, make better equipment, hunt stronger monster, and sometimes, hunt something multiple times to get what you need. With my minimal preparation, I hunted the first seven monsters without much trouble and never once carted* (aka, knocked out): <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Chatacabra">Chatacabra</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Quematrice">Quematrice</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Congalala">Congalala</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Lala_Barina">Lala Barina</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Balahara">Balahara</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Doshaguma">Doshaguma</a>, and finally, a repel quest for the Leviathan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Uth_Duna">Uth Duna</a>. When I played Monster Hunter: World for the very first time, even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Tobi-Kadachi">Tobi-Kadachi</a> gave me trouble, so I was surprised to encounter such little friction while playing Wilds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was actually <em>so </em>surprised that I went back and replayed the story in Monster Hunter: World through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Anjanath">Anjanath</a>, the seventh large monster.  Well, the answer is that I’ve just gotten a whole lot better since I first played World, even though by that point, I had been playing Monster Hunter since the very first one on PlayStation 2. I easily ripped through everything up to Anjanath, who then made me sweat a bit before I defeated it on my first try.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s funny, because I felt the same as when I played Monster Hunter Rise. I thought to myself, “This feels so much easier,” and in some ways, this could be because of the fun, zippy Wirebug mechanic and other factors, but that feeling was largely due to my increased skill as a player after 600 hours in World and Iceborne. That’s not to say I’m now some pro-level Monster Hunter–I’m certainly no speedrunner–but I’ve improved enough to notice. I’m bringing this up because I often see this lamentation in the community, questioning, “Perhaps, is Monster Hunter simply getting easier?” I would suggest that we may just be growing into better hunters. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers’ goals don’t suggest they intend to make Monster Hunter easier.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are certainly becoming more streamlined and accessible (see: Optimal Health and Status Recovery that removes the need to choose exactly how to heal, and the Focus Mode that makes it easier to aim) but the developers’ goals don’t suggest they intend to make Monster Hunter easier. Art director and executive director of Wilds, Kaname Fujioka, said the difficulty in Wilds generally follows suit from World. Series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto added:  “We’ve been incredibly careful in Wilds to guide players to the fun of Monster Hunter without changing the core of the series,” and I very much feel that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilds immediately directs players into the meat of what Monster Hunter really is: hunting large monsters that could be set-piece bosses in other games. he main missions smoothly integrate mini small monster hunts and gathering as part of the story, which is a wonderful way to teach players about these necessary activities without them feeling like a roadblock.  I’m conflicted about all of these…upgrades. I find myself always wanting to pull a “Back in my day…” and describe some archaic, ludicrous thing we used to have to do just to get by to be able to enjoy the game…like delivering explosive Powderstones from the top of a volcano while avoiding Gravios and Ioprey…and then doing it three more times because the quest didn’t count as cleared unless you were the one who posted it, and your whole party of four needed to clear it to join the next quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose I’m trying to say Monster Hunter has come a long way, and making it less convoluted and stripping away its “nonessential” bits and pieces has made it more palatable to a much larger crowd. Now, it’s largely just delectable meat with the occasional bone and dessert: there are no bitter vegetables to power through to be able to enjoy everyone’s favorite parts (except, maybe, grinding for a specific material.) And while on one hand I’m overjoyed that so many people have grown to truly enjoy something I love, there was something about being one of the few who prided themselves on eating their vegetables with a smile on their face. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, the evolution of Monster Hunter has continued to impress me. The nostalgia I have for how things used to be doesn’t cloud my judgment enough to make me misremember how I actually felt about needing to gather dozens of mushrooms and herbs and Wyvern eggs before I could finally hunt: “This is boring and tedious and my god please just let me kill a monster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilds delivers the thrill of hunting a monster extroadinarily fast. The main story immediately spits you into the thick of things, and you’ll have hunted your first large monster in the first twenty minutes after customizing your character and Palico. There are no Kestodon Kerfuffles to contend with–you are one of the chosen hunters to protect your fleet from the big bads, and so that’s what you do. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The action of these monster-hunting quests is seamlessly woven together with narrative tasks that drive the story and exciting cutscenes that drop you right into the fray. Travel is often accompanied by NPCs who progress the story with dialogue, so little time is wasted. The entire experience feels full and is structured like a more traditional RPG, as you aren’t posting quests from a board and loading into a map like in previous Monster Hunters. At the same time, you still have robust freedom to explore and discover things on your own without having your hand held too tightly.  I’ll need to play more to discover exactly how the new decoration system and ingredient farming work, but it does appear you’ll still need to keep up on eating and inventory management yourself to be the best hunter you can be. I do hope there are challenges ahead that will require adequate preparation to succeed, as that’s where I think Monster Hunter shines brightest, but I do believe I may have encountered at least one of those in the Oilwell Basin. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alone in the Depths</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We discuss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-meet-nu-udra-apex-of-the-oilwell-basin-ign-first">the Oilwell Basin and the four monsters I hunted there at length in our interview with the developers</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-exclusive-oilwell-basin-ajarakan-and-rompopolo-gameplay-ign-first">Rompopolo, Ajarakan</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-gravios-returns-in-this-exclusive-gameplay-ign-first">Gravios</a>, and the area’s apex, The Black Flame, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Nu_Udra">Nu Udra</a> inhabit the Oilwell Basin, which is designed to be more vertically connected, rather than the more horizontally laid out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Windward_Plains">Windward Plains</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Scarlet_Forest">Scarlet Forest</a>. Though it’s a rocky, cave-like locale filled with lava and mucky oilsilt, it’s inspired by the deep sea and the inhabitants of the ocean floor. This is much more apparent during the Plenty, where deep into the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Oilwell_Basin">Oilwell Basin</a> takes on an ethereal blue hue to contrast its muddy palette during the Fallow and bright, burning red-oranges of the Firespring. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The change in climate sometimes made me feel like I was in entirely different places, and this was even more pronounced in the Oilwell Basin. The changes in these three-mode cycles, plus the drastic visual changes between day and night, add even more variety to these vast, large, diverse maps— meant to be two to two-and-a-half times the size of the maps in World. And we've only seen three, but I'm sure there must be more. I feel like I barely got a handle on the layout of the Oilwell Basin while hunting, and will likely need to make a concerted effort to learn its flow and remember where things are, like the very helpful environmental traps, including a perfectly placed Sleeptoad beneath precariously placed stalactites in the ceiling of a cave. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When I beat it down enough, it deflated–a hilariously sad sight I was delighted to experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the monsters I faced there, they were a unique and impressive bunch. Rompopolo is absolutely grotesque, using its needle-like mouth to spew poison and the sharp appendage on its tail to inject gas into the ground, making use of the flammable oilsilt to cause large AOE explosions. It made great, unique use of its environment. When I beat it down enough, it deflated–a hilariously sad sight I was delighted to experience. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see Ajarakan giving some players a bit of trouble. It’s an ape-like fanged beast that’s aggressive, fast, and strong. It also just looks cool–how its body glows when it gets ramped up is magnificent, as is one of its strongest attacks, where it spins in the air and crashes down, like a fiery Sonic the Hedgehog homing attack. If you let it grab you, it will roar in your face before brutally dragging you across the ground and tossing you like a rag-doll. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Gravios, a returning monster, has been a pain in the ass to fight in previous games, with its hardy HP pool and super tough defenses, I found fighting it in Wilds much more enjoyable. Its hitboxes are more finely tuned, and the developers were able to gradate the toughness of its body more specifically, so it was easier to land hits on the points I actually wanted to get at. I also didn’t get hit by seemingly unfair hip-checks, which was a welcome change. Gravios has a new attack the developers were happy to be able to implement, too: a beam focused on the ground that turns the immediate surroundings into molten rock that persists for a few seconds with a fiery effect. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">An Impressive, Fiery New Foe</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to the apex, Nu Udra: wow. That thing is awesome, and it also really threatened to kick my ass. It’s the only monster that carted me during my playtime with Wilds, and I had the hardest time getting a read on its movements and intentions. Nu Udra is an octopus-like cephalopod that uses a skeleton (in game-design terms) entirely new to the Monster Hunter series, so of course I wouldn’t have any familiarity to rely on. Its tentacles can all move independently of each other, it moves with a graceful slickness, and it hits hard with its body and flame attacks.  Its unpredictable, multi-directional attack patterns seem to encourage teaming up with friends, or at least NPC Support Hunters, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nu Udra is also uniquely beautiful–the sensory organs on the tips of its tentacles glow when it intends to use them in an attack, and occasionally covers itself in oilsilt and engulfs itself in flames–another cool use of the environment by an Oilwell Basin inhabitant. One of its attacks even resembles a dangerous fireworks display. Truly, Nu Udra is an impressive sight to behold: a slithering, octopus-like, menacing creature engulfed in flame, hellbent on your destruction. How exciting! I’m really looking forward to how this creature is incorporated into Monster Hunter Wilds’ story, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I had no real context around the monster hunts in my time in the Oilwell Basin, as I could only really experience the hunts themselves after the Quest Start and before the Quest Complete screen, so all I can really tell you is that the monsters I fought in this build were in high rank, as was my equipment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The builds I played (in graphics mode on the PS5) also performed significantly better than the Open Beta Test. The monsters and environments acted as they were meant to, for the most part, and I didn’t experience any jarring graphical issues or bugs. This comes with the caveats that I was offline playing in single-player and that I, personally, probably wouldn’t notice if there was a small graphical stutter while fighting for my life. But if you’re in it for the gameplay, I can confidently say that Monster Hunter Wilds works well and looks good–in my opinion. I’m especially impressed by the fire and lava effects I saw in the Oilwell Basin– for example, the compressed fire beams from Gravios and Nu Udra engulfing itself in fire in real time. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my biggest curiosities is how Wilds’ story progression will work in multiplayer, as it’s one of the best parts about Monster Hunter, and something I haven’t been able to experience in Wilds outside of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-announced-but-dont-expect-improvements-set-for-launch-to-make-it-in">Open Beta Test</a>. But, I’m told you’ll be able to play through the story with friends without the roadblocks encountered in World, which is the most important factor for me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The impressive variety of monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds, both in appearance and behavior, and the environments I’ve seen have so much attention to detail that it’s clear how much care the developers put into the series. This is especially so after speaking with them about it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-worlds-ffxiv-and-the-witcher-3-collabs-inspired-monster-hunter-wilds-ign-first">Wilds developers implemented ideas they had been working on since back in World after players responded positively to it in the Witcher 3 collaboration, and they took advice from Final Fantasy XIV’s producer Naoki Yoshida while working with him on the FFXIV collab–which you can read more about here. </a>Truthfully, I could yap about Monster Hunter for days, but I’ll leave it at this–I can’t wait to sink another 300 hours into a new Monster Hunter. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, just a week later, the game is discounted on PC. Head over to Fanatical and use promo code <strong>FANATICAL15</strong> to get a Steam key of the remastered action classic for $42.49 (was $50).</p><p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black lets you play as Ryu Hayabusa--a ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword. The core gameplay has remained the same over the past 15 years, meaning you'll still be treated to a fast-paced and bloody combat system. However, this new version benefits from improved visuals, stages, characters, and lighting effects from Unreal Engine 5 that create a more modern gaming experience.</p><p>Other additions to Ninja Gaiden 2 Black include new characters, new modes for beginners, and a reworked weapon upgrade system. In short, this is the best way to experience the game in 2025.</p><p>While Fanatical is running its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-thousands-of-pc-games-and-unlock-free-steam-keys-during-fanaticals-lunar-new-year-sale/1100-6528927/" data-ref-id="1100-6528927">Lunar New Year</a> event, <strong>you’ll also get a free mystery gift with your purchase</strong>. You'll either receive a free Steam game or a coupon to use on your next purchase.</p><p>Alternatively, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is available on Xbox and PC Game Pass. So if you’d rather access it through Microsoft’s popular service, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Membership</a> for $50.

Sigma 2 released on PS3 in 2009, one year after the Ninja Gaiden 2's release on Xbox 360. Team Ninja told the same story in Sigma 2, but the gameplay, level design, boss battles, and other features were markedly different. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is more of an amalgamation of the two previous releases.</p><p>The general consensus among longtime fans is that Ninja Gaiden Black--<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-black/c17kks83s9gs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for $5 on the Xbox Store</a>--is better than Ninja Gaiden Sigma. So far, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ninja-gaiden-2-black/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fan and critic reactions to Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> have been generally aligned with the reception of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma 2</a>.</p><p>During the Developer Direct, Koei Tecmo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4 will drop sometime in 2025</a>--so whether you’re a fan or just experiencing the gory action for the first time, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is worth checking out ahead of the arrival of the long-awaited sequel.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1663046736" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>In 1989, the original Kickboxer martial arts movie helped establish Jean-Claude Van Damme as an action star. Now, for the first time ever, the Kickboxer franchise is making the leap to video games with Force Multiplier Studios, a team of developers with experience on Call of Duty, Borderlands, Halo, Tomb Raider, and Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Screenwriter Dimitri Logothetis and producer Rob Hickman--two of the filmmakers behind the 2016 film Kickboxer: Vengeance and its sequel, Kickboxer: Retaliation--are working with Force Multiplier Studios to bring the Kickboxer video game to life. But for now, the game is at such an early stage of development that there's nothing to show off.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-devs-are-making-the-first-ever-official-kickboxer-video-game-but-is-jean-claude-van-damme-in-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Force Multiplier Studios was very vague about whether Van Damme will lend his likeness to the game or participate in any way. Instead, the studio stated that the game "will combine the rich narrative of Kickboxer with kinetic martial arts action to deliver an intense, high-octane brawler, and feature iconic characters and locations from the franchise originally starring martial arts icon Jean-Claude Van Damme."</p><p>Van Damme returned to the franchise in Kickboxer: Vengeance and Kickboxer: Retaliation, and he remains the star who is most associated with the films. According to IGN, Van Damme is also set to return for another sequel, Kickboxer: Armageddon, which is expected to film later this year. Outside of Kickboxer, Van Damme portrayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-kombat-pack-includes-jean-claude-van-damme-skin-for-johnny-cage/1100-6514327/" data-ref-id="1100-6514327">a variant of Johnny Cage in Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, it's been announced that Summer Game Fest will be returning to Los Angeles from June 6 to June 9 for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/">fifth year in a row</a>. Summer Game Fest will have a Live Kickoff show from YouTube Theater hosted by Geoff Keighley, the man who famously hosts The Game Awards. SGF will be kicking off with a magnificent bang as a live, in-person, 2-hour showcase event will be taking place to begin the event. For those who can't attend in person, it will be streamed across more than 20 video platforms, including commonly used YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, and Steam.</p>
<p>For those who want to attend the event in person, the public ticket sales will begin later in the Spring. Summer Game Fest is a major event, and last year saw it deliver more than 36 million global livestreams, up by 12% Year-on-Year, as well as over 8,000 co-streams on Twitch and YouTube. With the showcase happening at the start of the event, there is the potential for SGF to be even bigger and better than before.</p>
<p>2025 will be introducing a couple of new features, including a business-to-business thought leader event, which will explore and investigate some of the changes, challenges, and opportunities present in the video game industry. During this event, the cultural impact and significance of video games will be celebrated, with the event being curated by Christopher Dring, the former head of GamesIndustry.biz, and Geoff Keighley.</p>
<p>As Summer Game Fest usually does, it will be supporting and uplifting the voices of publishers as well as hosting partner events and livestreams during the weekend of Summer Game Fest. This includes the well-known event of Day of the Devs, which is a special non-profit showcase that celebrates the magic of indie games. As it will be taking place during SGF, the event is called Day of the Devs: SGF Edition and will be presented online via a livestream after the live showcase takes place on June 6.</p>
<p>More information about the event can be found on the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Summer Game Fest website</a>, as well as their social media.</p>
