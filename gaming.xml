            <p>Dealing with perpetually unsatisfied, stunningly entitled hordes of chittering monsters and the occasional visit from a lumbering oaf of a boss can be tough work. But enough about working in retail - dungeon crawling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> sell’em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> is getting a sequel! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault looks to be just what you want from a follow-up. Created once again by Digital Sun, whose recent works include the excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cataclismo">Cataclismo</a>, it’s prettier and vaster, with expanded merchanting and deeper dungeoneering. It's out sometime in 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This time around, white-haired hero Will and his companions are “stranded in a mysterious dimension in the village of Tresna”. Will simply cannot wait to get back to more retail work, and soon discovers “a tantalizing opportunity to return home, thanks to a curious relic collector”. If horror stories of antiquity have taught me anything, it’s to immediately purchase any curious relics you find. Bonus points if its mysterious power only grows in tandem with your own hubris. Sounds fun! Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Revive Tresna’s Splendor:</strong> Invest in the village’s development by supporting local businesses, upgrading gear, and unlocking new opportunities. As Tresna flourishes, so will your shop’s fortunes.</p>
<p><strong>Loot Like a Legend:</strong> Prepare your gear, restrain your nerves, and delve into treacherous vaults filled with unimaginable treasures. But beware: the deeper you go, the higher the stakes—and the greater the risks.</p>
<p><strong>Master the Art of Shopkeeping:</strong> Transform your hard-earned loot into profits by charming customers and haggling like a pro. Customize your shop with dazzling decorations to draw even more eager buyers.</p></blockquote>
<p>“It definitely needs more variety earlier on, but when Moonlighter gets going, it's tremendously compelling,” is wot John (RPS in peace) thunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-review">of the original back</a> in 2018. “It's very charming, very beautiful, and both its comprising halves are enjoyable in their own ways.”</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Brendan did some words for this. I asked him five random words he used but he wouldn’t tell me. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Activision Blizzard has dropped the Season 14 launch trailer, and it ended with a glimpse of Overwatch 2's next collaboration: Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1864720158322794691" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender is coming to Overwatch 2! ⬇️✨<br>Join the fun when our latest collaboration arrives in-game on Dec 17 🤩 <a href="https://t.co/Z0HvK17NXv" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Z0HvK17NXv</a></p>  — Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1864720158322794691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The image is meant to invoke Avatar Aang, the main character of The Last Airbender.

As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/daredevil-born-again-time-jump-explained-wilson-bethel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/daredevil-born-again-time-jump-explained-wilson-bethel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by<em> Collider</em></a></span>, <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>actor Wilson Bethel recently told Fan Expo San Francisco that the upcoming Disney+ series takes place five years after that final Netflix season. With that much time passing, we can expect fully formed characters that have been through a lot.</p><p>“It picks up five years later. And so in theory, these are characters who have all lived five years of life and all of the twists and turns that you take in the meantime.”</p><p><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> leading man Charlie Cox first spoke about these changes during an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/daredevil-born-again-is-a-continuation-of-the-netflix-show-a-lot-of-the-history-follows-on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/daredevil-born-again-is-a-continuation-of-the-netflix-show-a-lot-of-the-history-follows-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Empire</em> interview</a></span>, staring that in the new show’s timeline, “Matt’s made peace with his role both as a lawyer and a vigilante.” While this may be a new development for the <em>Daredevil</em> series itself, it won’t fully be one in Marvel canon. Cox appeared on Marvel’s <em>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, </em>which takes place in 2023, and also appeared in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> which takes place in late 2024. That would situate the upcoming <em>Daredevil</em> series as a predecessor to those two appearances. </p><p>In those two appearances, we get a sense of this newfound balance of identities. In <em>She-Hulk, </em>we see Cox as lawyer Matt Murdock advising fellow lawyer Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) to embrace her superhero powers as She-Hulk to exert justice when the law doesn’t work, showing he’s come to terms with the duality of his role in the world. He also showed this balance after having sex with her and exhibiting what may be Marvel’s first superhero walk of shame in full costume. </p><p>The same is true for his appearance in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> when he gave legal advice to Peter Parker and reflexively snatched a brick thrown through Parker’s window. When Parker, who normally has the quickest reflexes in any room he’s in, asks how he did that, Murdock again highlighted that balance between lawyer and vigilante by saying his superhuman feat is the product of being a really good lawyer. </p><p>That’s all well and good, but <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> is going to have to show us how it fits within all of the events that have happened in the five years since the Netflix series. We still don’t know who from the <em>Daredevil</em> universe was affected by Thanos’s Infinity Gauntlet snap. The series also takes place before the events of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-movie-russo-arcane-avengers-endgame-1851691386?_gl=1*mufm68*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDYwMC45MC4xLjE3MzM0MjMxMDkuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-movie-russo-arcane-avengers-endgame-1851691386?_gl=1*mufm68*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDYwMC45MC4xLjE3MzM0MjMxMDkuNjAuMC4w"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a></span>, when everyone who’d previously been evaporated was brought back. Since the series takes place before Thanos’ genocidal acts were reversed, we at least now know Daredevil survived the blip. </p><p>With <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>situated between two of the biggest moments in MCU history, there’s potential for plenty of cool easter eggs throughout the series that refer back to that history. Those moments should help give us a sense of time, even if that time is Marvel’s confusing version of it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has unveiled a brand-new gameplay video from their upcoming open-world action-adventure game, Crimson Desert. This game is not to be confused with the MMORPG Black Desert Online. The video showcases the intense boss fight players will have against Hexe Marie. If you want to see what you'll be up against when fighting Hexe Marie, you can check it out in the combat video below, which is just under seven and a half minutes, showing you all of the frightening moves you'll have to contend with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert – Hexe Marie Boss Battle Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrQgbLuIzq0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many boss fight videos have been posted on the official Crimson Desert YouTube channel, including videos of <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shown-off-in-50-minute-gameplay-video/">some early gameplay</a> that showcases the environments and exploration that players can expect to experience for themselves.</p>
<p>The battle with Hexe Marie is a little bit different from the other boss fights that have been showcased by Pearl Abyss, as Hexe Marie is a two-phase fight. Not only do players have to fight off against Hexe Marie, but they also have to kill the waves of her summoned minions, which leads to an incredibly intense fight.</p>
<p>Kliff can use ice arrows and explosive arrows to take out the hordes of minions that she summons. While this is just one option, there are many different ways for the player to experiment in battle to create their own strategies to overcome the target.</p>
<p>For those who are just hearing about this game for the first time, Crimson Desert takes place in the huge continent of Pywel and tells the tale of Kliff and his comrades as they go on an extensive journey to fulfill their mission while finding secrets and uncovering new mysteries about their lived-in home world. While the game doesn't have a release date yet, it's set to release simultaneously on PC and consoles when the time comes.</p>
<p>In addition to the fight and the gameplay elements that are being shown in this video, Pearl Abyss has also drawn attention to some of the changes they've made since the first public hands-on demo of the game at Gamescom 2024. This includes updates to the user interface and the target lock system in particular, both of which are essential tools to the player.</p>
<p>For more on Crimson Desert, you can check out <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main/Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their official website</a>, which includes information about boss fights they've shared previously, as well as the option to sign up to their newsletter for emails when there are new updates.</p>

It also led to a lot of discourse, too. Then, months after the viral video had faded from most people’s memories, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hawk-tuah-girl-jake-paul-podcast-betr-haliey-welch-1851639848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hawk-tuah-girl-jake-paul-podcast-betr-haliey-welch-1851639848">Welch announced she was doing a podcast</a></span> on Jake Paul’s sports betting network. And during all this, she also announced a cyrpto coin called Hawkcoin that fans would be able to buy and invest in. Predictably, this has gone poorly. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=hawk-tuah-memecoin-immediately-crashes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=hawk-tuah-memecoin-immediately-crashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Web3IsGoingGreat</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/news/hawk-tuah-memecoin-dumps-90-percent-outrage-token-launch-insider&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hawk-tuah-memecoin-dumps-90-percent-outrage-token-launch-insider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>CoinTelegraph</em></a></span>, Welch’s Hawkcoin has been a disaster. The memecoin launched on December 4 and quickly reached a total market value of $490 million. Just a few hours later, the value of the coin had crashed as people started selling en masse. As of this writing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dexscreener.com/solana/exygvxvrvujjryo65vyuhlaccxhwyztkqa7jxqit2tvr&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/exygvxvrvujjryo65vyuhlaccxhwyztkqa7jxqit2tvr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawkcoin’s market value is hovering around $28 million, a nearly  95 percent drop</a></span>. Yikes.</p><p>A drop that fast has some people speculating that Welch and her team could have purposely inflated the coin, pumping up its value, then dumping it at its peak and making a lot of money in the process. Welch has denied this, saying that she and her team didn’t inflate the coin’s value and blamed the crash on snipers. (These are investors who hop in the moment a coin is available to buy, grab a ton, and sell them as quickly as possible to make a profit before a crash.) </p><p> “Team hasn’t sold one token and not 1 KOL was given 1 free token,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864448384326881713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864448384326881713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Welch in a post on Twitter</a></span>. “We tried to stop snipers as best we could through high fee’s in the start of launch on Meteora.” </p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bostonrob__/status/1864494571947757839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bostonrob__/status/1864494571947757839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data seems to indicate</a></span> that someone dumped $1.4 million worth of MOODENG coin (based on the hippo the internet loved for a few weeks) for Hawkcoin and apparently lost most of it after trying to swap back to the hippo coin. The future sucks, but at least some rich people are losing in the saddest ways possible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But some fans are already voicing their displeasure over aspects from Arcane spilling into the game, particularly with the new look for Viktor.</p><p>The new models debuted on the test servers in November, with implementation in the main game expected to occur next week. Prior to the changes, Viktor's in-game portrayal depicted him as a larger and more imposing figure than the new Viktor character model. The updated version of Viktor is inspired by his portrayal in the show, and he now has a much thinner body shape. Riot Games has already modified the latest designs for Viktor in response to the negative feedback, but that hasn't been enough to settle the issue yet. The following video illustrates some of the differences between the new Viktor skins and the old ones.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTIrkYHn3Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHTIrkYHn3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After their initial makeovers, the Deathsworn Viktor and Creator Viktor skins were modified to more closely reflect Viktor's previous in-game appearance without fully walking back the changes made to his model. So far, the hardcore Viktor fans--especially the ones who paid for the original skins--don't appear to be satisfied by those adjustments. Subsequently, Riot's Paul Bellezza stated on X/Twitter that the developer is "looking at making some adjustments to Viktor's update based on your feedback."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/RiotPabro/status/1864369476852175008" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Quick update on Arcane Fractured Jinx and Viktor’s update:<br>We’re adding Jinx’s iconic finale hood to her first form (Hero of Zaun) in Patch 14.24.

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 is a dream for many PlayStation owners. It’s been too long since Indy graced our screens in computer game form, and it feels like the right moment. Thankfully, we don’t need to go on a crusade to tell you the status of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s release schedule.</p>



<p>The iconic Indiana Jones jingle applies to almost any situation. Carry the shopping into your house in one go, play the jingle, beat a boss on a game, play the jingle, watch footage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-play-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-full-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>—you get the idea. It’s fair to say Indiana Jones games haven’t gone down as well as the films, with releases such as The Emperor’s Tomb and Staff of Kings not living long in the memory.</p>



<p>It’s time for Indy to have a successful virtual outing—that isn’t a LEGO entry—and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 can be the one. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-coming-to-playstation-5">Is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take that doubters! Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is definitely coming to PlayStation 5</strong>, despite initial doubts it would due to Microsoft’s ownership of Bethesda Softworks.</p>



<p>In September 2020, Microsoft famously purchased Bethesda in a shocking deal worth $7.5 billion. Microsoft effectively owned the rights to a ton of franchises in the blink of an eye: Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, DOOM, and Wolfenstein. Bethesda announced it was working on a new Indiana Jones game several months after the announcement—leaving PlayStation players in the dark over its release exclusivity.</p>



<p>An agreement was eventually released ensuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is confirmed for PS5</a>. The slight caveat is the Xbox Series X|S and PC get first dibs for a few months, meaning, PS users need to channel some patience. So it’s not all Temple of Doom and gloom, and even the developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-developers-thrilled-game-is-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thrilled the Great Circle is making its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-releasing-on-ps5">When is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Releasing on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>April 2025 is when Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The projected Great Circle launch window for PS5 comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a>, In a report, they said, “Sources familiar with Bethesda’s plans tell me the company has been targeting an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2025 release for&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;on PS5</a>, but this date could naturally shift depending on development schedules.”</p>



<p>Obviously, this wording means there could be some changes as we get closer to April 2025. Take the information with a grain of salt—although Tom is a very reliable reporter—in case Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn’t release in April 2025.</p>

<p>As a PS5 owner, I’m more than happy to see Indiana Jones and the Great Circle eventually come to the console. Do you think this is better for everyone involved? Let us know in the comments.

          <p>Longtime Valve watchers likely remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steam-machines/">Steam Machines</a>, the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">aborted</a>, pre-Steam Deck attempt at crafting a line of third-party gaming PC hardware based around <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/valve-first-version-of-steamos-to-be-released-to-the-masses-on-friday/">an early verison of its Linux-based SteamOS</a>. Now, there are strong signs that Valve is on the verge of launching a similar third-party hardware branding effort under the "Powered by SteamOS" label.</p>
<p>The newest sign of those plans come via <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">newly updated branding guidelines</a> posted by Valve on Wednesday (as noticed by <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/compare/d54725a035de...41944930ea8a#diff-5daae83579359a756437d0a949cfce0a729a6857724a1740b2825f45fd0d9292">the trackers at SteamDB</a>). That update includes the first appearance of a new "Powered by SteamOS" logo intended "for hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve."</p>
<p>The document goes on to clarify that the new Powered by SteamOS logo "indicates that a hardware device will run the SteamOS and boot into SteamOS upon powering on the device." That's distinct from the licensed branding for merely "Steam Compatible" devices, which include "non-Valve input peripherals" that have been reviewed by Valve to work with Steam.</p>
<p>The new guidelines replace <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Steam_Guidelines_060222.pdf">an older set of branding guidelines</a>, last revised in late 2017, that included detailed instructions for how to use the old "Steam Machines" name and logo on third-party hardware. That branding has been functionally defunct for years, making Valve's apparent need to suddenly update it more than a little suspect.</p>
