It is an incredibly difficult thing to sell someone on a game in just one sentence. What are you meant to focus on, genre, specific mechanics, an interesting element of the story? There's not a right answer! I'm not going to figure out a recipe for success right here and now, but what I can do is at least show you a single sentence that sold me on a game called Burden Street Station quite quickly: "A surreal, narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game where you shapeshift during conversations to uncover how God went missing."
</p>
<p>
A stunner of a line! The concept of God going missing and the implication that it is your responsibility to figure it out says a tremendous amount in a few words. I know the genre, a narrative adventure game, and there is even a hint towards mechanics, the shapeshifting element. Personally, that's all I need to be convinced, but we'll dig deeper all the same.

A surreal game where you mostly help all sorts of freaks come to terms with the fact that god no longer exists.
and you'll get to know more about it it very, very soon.

DEMO COMING TO STEAM TOMORROW. WE WILL BE WAITING.

In the world of Burden Street Station, moments from the lives of mortals, be they good or bad, are taken and turned into sentient books, which in turn get sold to Gods for the same reason you and I read books, entertainment. Except in your particular world, the production of these books stops in its tracks, and its God vanishes. So you, alongside one of those sentient books, must talk to the people of this world to figure out what the hell went down.
</p><p>
There's an apparent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> influence here, and an overall '90s PC adventures game vibe, alongside more modern series like ENA. Mechanically, you can change different parts of your body throughout your conversations with mortals to produce different dialogue options, some of which look suitably irreverent and sarcastic, the epitome of '90s conversations.
</p>
<p>
Apparently a demo for it will be available tomorrow, December 2nd, so let's all agree to log on to Steam and give it a go, yeah? Or at least wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126340/Burden_Street_Station/">here</a> in the meantime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some good news for folks wanting an update on Sony’s previously announced <em>Helldivers</em> feature film. Justin Lin, best known for his work on the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">Fast &amp; Furious </a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">franchise</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">,</a></em> is set to direct the cinematic adaptation of PlayStation and Arrowhead’s massively popular online co-op shooter.</p> <p>On December 1, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported that Justin Lin is going to both direct and produce</a> the <em>Helldivers</em> movie via his Perfect Storm Entertainment media company. He’ll be working alongside PlayStation Productions on the live-action adaptation, which was first announced in January 2025.&nbsp;The upcoming Helldivers movie has a script written by <em>Annabelle</em> and <em>It</em> writer Gary Dauberman.</p>

 <p>Justin Lin is a perfect choice for <em>Helldivers</em>. He has experience working on big-budget action movies, having directed <em>The Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast &amp; Furious 4, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6,</em> and <em>F9: The Fast Saga.</em> He also directed <em>Star Trek: Beyond,</em> the third and presumably last film in the JJ Abrams-produced modern Star Trek reboot trilogy. While the Fast movies can be over-the-top nonsense, the action and visuals within the movies are top-notch notch and each one is fast-paced. This resume feels like the perfect fit for Helldivers, especially with a solid script that leans into the absurd space-facism of the series.</p>

 <p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> says that Lin isn’t a gamer, but used that fact to his advantage when pitching his take on <em>Helldivers</em> to Sony and PlayStation. He reportedly wants to focus on the humanity in the characters and feature a “timely” story as well as build up what could be a future franchise for the studio.</p> <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-ghost-tsushima-1851733809"> Sony has plenty of other PlayStation adaptations in the works</a>, including a <em>God of War</em> series, <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> movie adaptations, and a <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> anime spin-off. And let’s not forget the <em>Last of Us</em> series on HBO, which has proven to be a massive hit for all involved. Get ready, because this is just the start of Sony and other game studios digging into their vaults filled with old IP to find the next big blockbuster.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers Film Adds Fast and Furious Director, It Writer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-film-director-fast-and-furious-it-writer/</link>
            <guid>1369876</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Justin Lin, the director of several Fast and Furious films, has been announced as the director of the live-action Helldivers film. In addition, the writer of several horror films, like Annabelle and I,t wrote the script for the video game adaptation. </p>



<p>As one of PlayStation’s newer series, Helldivers didn’t seem to hit its stride until 2024, when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-brings-in-around-2-5-million-players-every-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it became a worldwide phenomenon</a>. The multiplayer sci-fi shooter was a viral sensation and still is in some ways. With constant updates and a recent port to Xbox, Arrowhead Studios’ hit felt primed for Hollywood. In January 2025, it was announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be brought to film</a> by Sony Pictures. Updates went silent for a bit until now, where it’s been revealed that a high-profile director and writer are attached.</p>







<h2 id="h-justin-lin-directing-helldivers-film-for-sony-pictures-written-by-gary-dauberman">Justin Lin Directing Helldivers Film for Sony Pictures, Written by Gary Dauberman</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the outlet revealed that Justin Lin has joined the Helldivers film as director. He will be adapting from a script written by Gary Dauberman. While additional crew and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting</a> have yet to be revealed, the report says that Lin plans to bring out the ‘humanity’ of the game with timely themes and a built-out world. It also seems like the story will revolve around a squad of elite Helldivers taking on various creatures and the Super Earth. </p>



<p>If you’ve watched any Fast and Furious movie from the 2010s, it’s likely been directed by Justin Lin. The filmmaker is a hit with action-film fans and a notable name in the genre. Currently, Lin is set to direct Keanu Reeves in BRZRKR and adapt One Punch Man into a film. For Gary Dauberman, the scribe has been behind some of horror’s recent hits like It (and its sequel, It Chapter Two), Annabelle, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a>. All that said, it’ll be interesting to see how Helldivers shapes up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel.</p><p>Per <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-1236262719/"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>, scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it's not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ <a href="https://gameinformer.com/series-review/2024/04/22/knuckles-show-review-a-low-stakes-climb"><em>Knuckles</em></a> series?&nbsp; Let us know what you think in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>[Source: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/paramount-announces-a-new-sonic-universe-film-for-holiday-2028]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Six years ago, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> was published by author Rachel Reid, the second novel in the popular hockey-rivals-turned-lovers series </span><i><span>Game Changers</span></i><span>. Now, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> is a Canadian TV series airing on HBO Max here in the US, and though it’s only been out for a few days, the internet is about to put itself in the penalty box with how openly horny viewers are getting about it.</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, which stars Hudson Williams as Asian-Canadian hockey player Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie as his Russian-born rival, Ilya Rozanov, is what some may consider a yaoi series. The Japanese term is used for a hyperspecific media genre focused on male characters in sexual relationships, also known as Boy Love, and the series certainly seems to be leaning into that concept. There’s a lot of loaded looks, barely there caresses, heavy breathing, and, eventually, very hot sex.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> premiered on November 28, and I have texted every single one of my friends about it over the course of the last few days (when describing the premise of “gay hockey men on rival teams” to my friend, she wrote back, “Did someone steal your diary?”). The show follows two players in the fictitious Major League Hockey league as they rise from ambitious rookies to superstars on the ice, all while navigating a searing hot attraction to each other. It’s currently sitting at an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, and it seems to be all anyone (read: women, gay men) can talk about.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I will admit that I am a huge hockey fan, so my algorithm may be slightly skewed, but both my TikTok and Twitter For You pages have been filled with people reacting to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>. Fans are posting their reactions to certain sexually explicit scenes (including one that takes place in the locker room) and others that are demure but filled with more tension than when two dudes have to sit in adjacent penalty boxes after beating the piss out of each other.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the only appropriate reaction to ilya in this moment <a href="https://t.co/EbH0UgQujx">pic.twitter.com/EbH0UgQujx</a></p> <p>— Rosie 💖 (@fangirl000777) <a href="https://twitter.com/fangirl000777/status/1995341190238249354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All you horny bitches keep tweeting about is Heated Rivalry or is my algorithm just very homosexual… the thirst is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before dear lord</p> <p>— Lushious Massacr (@LushiousMassacr) <a href="https://twitter.com/LushiousMassacr/status/1994989655993766396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there’s gonna be a lot of “no mom, I just love hockey” happening across the US family HBO Max plans</p> <p>— spencer (top 0.1% of spencers) (@hoddsuspenders) <a href="https://twitter.com/hoddsuspenders/status/1995251268059865542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">you’d have to put me in an involuntary psychiatric hold if i was hollander <a href="https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA">https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA</a></p> <p>— cooper (@marnieapologist) <a href="https://twitter.com/marnieapologist/status/1994806070544666766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/qhLPJBRjHL">pic.twitter.com/qhLPJBRjHL</a></p> <p>— CINEMA 505 (@CINEMA505) <a href="https://twitter.com/CINEMA505/status/1994491724761370840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That the lead actors are leaning into the show’s horniess is helping to increase the </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>hype.

		<p>Amazon’s TV adaption of Sony’s God of War games has landed an Emmy award-winning director for the first two episodes. Frederick E.O. Toye has signed up and should be familiar with historical violence having directed Shogun for Disney, and also The Boys for Amazon.</p>
<p>He joins Ronald D. Moore, creator of the highly acclaimed Battlestar Galactica remake, who will be the showrunner for the two seasons that have been ordered. The series was announced in 2022 with Rafe Judkins as the showrunner, but he left the project in 2024 due to creative differences.</p>


<p><em>“’God of War’&nbsp;is a compelling, character-driven franchise that we believe will captivate our global customers as much with its expansive and immersive worlds as its rich storytelling,”</em> Vernon Sanders, head of global television at Amazon Studios, said. <em>“We are honored to share in the adventure of exploring the&nbsp;God of War&nbsp;mythology in such a momentous way with Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Santa Monica Studio.”</em></p>
<p>Sony has a Horizon Zero Dawn movie in the works and a sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced years ago, but that seems to be dead in the water, perhaps due to Tom Holland’s busy schedule.&nbsp; Sony Pictures are also producing the Metal Gear Solid movie.</p>

            <p>
Around May last year, the one and only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/ron-gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curse-of-monkey-island">Monkey Island</a> fame announced an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that was meant to be some kind of mix between classic Zelda, and Diablo, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, that last one being another of the game designer's notable works. It never got a full reveal, or even a name, and unfortunately it seems it never will, as it's essentially been canned.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert recently spoke with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">Ars Technica</a> about his career, including his most recently released game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ron-gilberts-new-death-by-scrolling-rpg-about-never-ending-grind-and-the-absurdity-of-social-media-is-out-now">Death by Scrolling</a>, which just launched this October, but the interview kicks off by discussing his unnamed RPG. The designer explained that after working on adventure games like Thimbleweed Park and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-to-monkey-island">Return to Monkey Island</a> for a good many years, he was "thinking about something new."
</p>
<p>
That something new resulted in Gilbert hiring an artist and another designer, putting a year's worth of time into the aforementioned RPG. The problem? Not enough people, and as is the case with most of life, not enough money. "I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained. "You know, it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."
</p>
<p>
For Gilbert, bringing in funds was tougher than he thought it would be. He tried pitching the game to various places, but "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible." He continued, "Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn’t the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn’t look at it as ‘we’re gonna make $100 million and it’s worth investing in.' The amount of money they’re willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."
</p><p>
Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter don't work so well these days either, as Gilbert's Thimbleweed Park also went that route, and while it wracked up more than $600,000, the game dev noted that it still had private investors providing half of the game's final budget.
</p>
<p>
This is mostly just another reminder that making games isn't just hard because they're technically complex, but they have material necessities that can't always be met due to external forces. Would be nice if someone did something about that. Revolution anyone?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-director/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell Remake director David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft to finish what he started in 2021.</p>



<p>Announced on his LinkedIn profile, David Grivel announced that he’s rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as the project’s Game Director for the Splinter Cell Remake. </p>







<p>The Splinter Cell Remake originally started development in 2021 under the codename ‘North’, with not much else being said on the game since. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in 2024 that the game is currently in development on the Snowdrop engine, with a tentative release date of 2026. It’s likely given the projects (and Ubisoft as a whole) issues that this release date is no longer accurate, but we will update our readers when we learn more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming received footage of the project in early 2025, which showed Irving Lambert speaking to Sam Fisher in a superb cinematic. As it’s understood, the Splinter Cell Remake is a fully-fledged remake from the ground up, which will include being built around a modern audience from the ground up, rather than a simple graphic rehaul.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the game is in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>As for what Grivel’s return to the game means for the game’s immediate future is unclear, but the news that development continues on the game will be a warm welcome to those who were skeptical of the project’s future.</p>

This first-person shooter takes place in a universe where aliens came to Earth to use humanity as ingredients for intergalactic pharmaceutical drugs. Now, a new trailer for the game facetiously markets itself to alien consumers as it encourages them to use Humanzapro, a new wonder drug made from humans.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkTG28-CZbI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkTG28-CZbI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer is done in the style of pharmaceutical ads that typically run on American TV. All of the tropes of those ads are present, including the footage of happy aliens after they've taken the drug. Intriguingly, the ad warns humans that they shouldn't be taking Humanzapro because of side effects. That makes us wonder if this particular drug will be a power-up during the game.</p><p>High on Life introduced players to the Rick and Morty-esque talkative sci-fi weapons, which was fitting since the first game was produced by Rick and Morty co-creator--and Squanch Games co-founder--Justin Roiland, who also voiced a sentient alien weapon. Roiland was forced out of Squanch Games and Rick and Morty following <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/justin-roiland-abuse-allegations-what-we-know-1826967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a series of allegations</a>.</p><p>The sequel is introducing a new feature that will let players skateboard into battle and incorporate it into their offensive moves. Alternatively, players can use the boards to perform tricks.</p><p>High on Life 2 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 13, 2026. It's also slated to be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Outside of the game, it was reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-success-story-high-on-life-getting-a-tv-show-with-one-of-its-hilarious-voice-actors/1100-6525587/">High on Life animated series</a> is in development.</p>

<p>Note that this <em>isn't</em> the planned Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie, which is coming out in <strong>March 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>We have no other details right now, but there are a lot of opportunities to branch out in the Sonic universe, with tons of untapped characters and other video games the movies can draw from.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like a no-brainer to expand the Sonic movie universe — the first three films have all received warm critical reception, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie">particularly Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, and fans seem to absolutely love them.</p>
<p>Collectively, the franchise has made over $1 billion at the box office and spawned a TV show focusing on Knuckles the Echidna, so more movies surely means more money.</p>
<p>We at least have some idea of who will feature in the Sonic 4 movie, so we'll have to excitedly wait and see on what the Sonic Universe movie will bring.</p>

              <p>Extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> sells you the fantasy of being either a lone wanderer or part of a ragtag crew, rummaging through the wreckage of a fallen civilization to rebuild something better. Along the way, you can expect brutal gunfights with deadly machines and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">traitorous fellow raiders</a>. It <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">makes for a great adrenaline rush</a> as you exchange fire with man and machine.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I Keep Playing No Matter How Much I Suck</a></p> <p>But recently, I had the pleasure of chatting with a player who’s found a different role to play in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ post-apocalyptic Italy: that of a fruit salesman.</p>

 <p>Reddit user GrumbleGrits recently shared a video of this experience, putting down firearms in exchange for fruit and other harmless goods. Check it out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oxoism/welcome_to_the_fruit_shop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">here</a>:</p>   <p>This moment speaks to what I love about the extraction shooter genre and how it breaks open the expected routine of what we do in these kinds of games. The simple premise of getting in, grabbing loot, and getting out leaves a wide open space in between for unexpected emergent outcomes and creative playstyles, and that includes subversive ways of interacting with others. In a game where you can just as easily <i>not</i> shoot other players as you can otherwise murder them, why not consider peace? Why not find a new way to ascend the game’s meta?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Fans Have A New Tool For Revenge Against Assholes</a></p> <p>That’s what GrumbleGrits and others have done. We recently chatted a bit over DM on Reddit about his experience as a post-apocalyptic fruit farmer setting up shop in an abandoned newsstand.</p>

 <p>Though he was quick to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/wGr0f4vxfic">there are others in <i>Arc Raiders</i> setting up trade shops</a> (and many people coordinate on Reddit and elsewhere to arrange a trade for various hide-to-find pieces of loot) and insisted that he doesn’t want to receive any special credit for his efforts, setting up a fruit stand in the game certainly requires work.</p>

  <p>“I always try to have different stock each time,” he told me. “Sometimes I bring as many harvestable plants as I can, typically focusing on the materials needed to train Scrappy.” He’ll even trade non-edible goods as well, such as the many forms of loot that exist for no other reason than to sell to the in-game NPCs.</p>

 <p>But fruits and plants, which are needed to level up the player’s pet rooster that dispenses materials after every match, are important and, critically, often hard to come by. <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ typically unexpected and excessive violence can make holding on to these materials all the way to extraction hard enough as it is. That violence is something GrumbleGrits has to contend with when trading his goods.</p>

 <p>“It’s not all sunshine and rainbows,” he said, “getting to the chosen location for my storefront, clearing out Arc, and surviving any aggressive raiders along the way can be really difficult and occasionally results in tragedy. Once I reach the spot and get situated, I usually don’t have much issue with being attacked by other raiders.”</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>It’s a very different kind of fantasy than many are used to when it comes to <i>Arc Raiders</i>: venturing out not to just find what you can and keep it for yourself, but doing so with the intention to trade it with others, and putting in the work to establish a safe trading zone.</p> <p>It’s not the only way GrumbleGrits plays, of course. “Between working a real-world job and engaging with all the various other systems of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and collecting items to trade away in the first place, it can be difficult to find time to goof off and set up these little shops,” he said. While trading fruit makes for a unique way to interact with others and use the game’s loot system, GrumbleGrits isn’t throwing down his weapons permanently any time soon. Just recently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pb39k2/goodbye_big_lady_my_first_queen_kill/">he shared some footage of his first Queen kill</a>. But who knows, maybe the loot he’ll earn from this battle might show up on a store shelf soon.</p>

 <p>Of course, the experience is not without its theatrics. “I once had a couple of guys duel to the death with their melee weapons for a stack of mushrooms,” he said, recounting one of the more unique situations. “It was a violent and quick battle,” he said, “a testament to how sought-after mushrooms can be. They’re difficult to find if you don’t know where to look.”</p> <p>Thankfully, GrumbleGrits and other players not only know where to look for hard-to-find loot, but they’re also willing to share the wealth.</p>

Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA.</p><p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!" <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACOWhuwBwYrSgCaAXycFQL8Ess7nITKi_yU">Grivel's LinkedIn post announcing the news reads</a>. "A very special team and project to me," the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji.

Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting.</p><p>Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it's unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it's a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here's hoping we'll see a more concrete update sometime soon.</p><p>[<em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/game-director-david-grivel-rejoins-splinter-cell-remake-after-leaving-in-late-2022]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amazon's God of War TV series is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">set to start filming in March 2026</a> after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/">show was rebooted with Ronald D. Moore</a> now at the helm as showrunner. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a> reveals that Amazon has ordered two seasons of the show, and that the first two episodes of season one will be directed by Emmy award-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye of Shogun and The Boys.</p>



<p>Moore is still leading the charge on the show as its showrunner, writer, and executive producer, but Toye will take the directing reins for the first two episodes, the two episodes that, arguably more than the ones that will follow, will set the tone for the series.</p>



<p>Deadline's report also adds that, ahead of filming in March, the show has already started pre-production in Vancouver. It's currently unclear what elements of the God of War series the show will pull from, though we know that the show will pull from God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok, rather than the original Greek mythology-focused God of War games.</p>



<p>Casting for Kratos and Atreus is currently underway, as the big question around the show is who will be chosen to fill those iconic roles. Christopher Judge, who plays Kratos in the new rebooted version of God of War, has previously talked about throwing his hat in the ring, but also adds that he has no animosity towards whoever gets the role. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo revealed its Black Friday 2025 deals last month and there was no <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-is-on-amazon-pre-order-invite-usa-available-1851785835">discounted Switch 2 among them</a>. This was not surprising, given that the new hardware became the fastest-selling console launch ever this year. What is surprising is that Walmart decided to do its own discounted Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle for Cyber Monday, and Amazon followed suit.</p> <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-plus-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle/16422361549">Walmart</a> crashed the fake internet retail holiday with the best deal on a Switch 2 yet. It was $50 off the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle, which includes the $80 game and is usually priced at $500. At just $450, it essentially gave customers the game for free. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-Pok%C3%A9monTM-Legends-Switch-2/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon</a> then followed up with its own match, and at least as of the time of writing, I was able to get one in my shopping cart for the discounted price (the Walmart one wasn’t working).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle still available for $449 at Walmart (price in cart) <a href="https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g">https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g</a> <a href="https://t.co/eqFxtps9Kk">pic.twitter.com/eqFxtps9Kk</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1995527157121224954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s unclear how much longer the deal will last, or if it might sporadically come back throughout the holiday season. Is it an extremely limited discount, or are Walmart and Amazon just that desperate to get people through their online doors? Or maybe it was a last-minute decision in a hyper-competitive holiday season, as people get more discerning about their purchases while everything shoots up in price.</p>

 <p>The only other console maker doing big discounts this year is Sony, which took $100 off the price of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-black-friday-deals-dualsense-edge-controller-2000645182">PS5 Pro and standard model</a>, both of which had already been marked up due to recent tariff-fueled pricing adjustments. Nintendo, on the other hand, seems happy to have customers pay full price for most of its new games and even its old consoles.</p> <p>A Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle that had been a mainstay of the company’s Black Friday sale lineup for years <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413">was MIA this year</a>. I guess it didn’t want to be caught competing with itself. The Xbox Series X/S, more expensive than ever, didn’t get a discount either.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Split Fiction is a game from the same team behind It Takes Two. It features Mio and Zoe, two contrasting writers who have been trapped in their own stories and hooked to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. One world is sci-fi, and the other is fantasy, featuring everything from challenging a monkey to a dance battle, fighting an evil kitty, and riding gravity bikes and sand sharks.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The live-action God of War from Amazon Prime Video has found a director for its inaugural episodes in an Emmy winner. Furthermore, the show has already been greenlit for a second season.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s bloody God of War series has entertained players since 2005. While it has likely been attempted, a Hollywood adaptation has never been successfully done. In 2022, Prime Video announced that the reboot duology would be brought to streaming as a show, with many of the game’s crew helping with the production. While rumors of casting and filming have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made their way online</a>, it seems the show is already far into production.</p>







<h2 id="h-amazon-prime-video-s-god-of-war-gets-frederick-e-o-toye-to-direct-first-episodes-casting-and-pre-production-underway">Amazon Prime Video’s God of War Gets Frederick E.O. Toye to Direct First Episodes, Casting and Pre-Production Underway</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, the outlet revealed that director Frederick E.O. Toye has been tapped to direct the first two episodes of God of War for Prime Video. The acclaimed director has done many shows for Amazon like The Boys and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-release-date-when-is-the-new-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, but is most known for his Emmy-winning work on Shogun and the episode “Crimson Sky”. It’s unclear if E.O. Toye will direct any other episodes in the first or second season.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the show has already been renewed for a second season, as it was pitched to have a two-season order. Pre-production for God of War is already underway, with casting also currently going on. That means that, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the February film date is true</a>, fans may know who Kratos and Atreus are in the next two months. Many names for Kratos, like Dave Bautista and Winston Duke, have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kratos-actor-shortlist-outlined-by-movie-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">floated around</a>, but it seems fans will know quite soon. With a second season, it does look quite likely that it will adapt both God of War and God of War: Ragnarok.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-a-witcher-free-decade-cdpr-still-promises-three-sequels-in-six-years/</link>
            <guid>1369738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>It’s been over 10 years since the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-hunting-fiends-for-fun-and-forever/">the excellent <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a>, and nearly four years since <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/42167/a-new-saga-begins">the announcement</a> of “the next installment in The Witcher series of video games.” Despite those long waits, developer CD Projekt Red is still insisting it will deliver the next three complete <em>Witcher</em> games in a short six-year window.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">a recent earnings call</a>, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/the-witcher-will-return-as-a-triple-a-rpg-shifting-to-unreal-engine-5/">in 2022</a>. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/cd-projekt-red-offers-refunds-to-unsatisfied-cyberpunk-2077-console-players/">widespread technical issues with the console versions of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, which CDPR later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/cdpr-ceo-blames-in-game-streaming-for-cyberpunks-console-problems/">blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.”</a></p>
<p>“We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [<em>The Witcher 4</em>] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call. “In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time—as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between <em>TW4</em> and <em>TW5</em>, between <em>TW5</em> and <em>TW6</em> and so on.”</p>
<h2>Don’t start the clock just yet</h2>
<p>To be clear, the “six-year period” Nowakowski is talking about here starts with the eventual release of <em>The Witcher 4</em>, meaning the developer plans to release two <em>additional</em> sequels within six years of that launch. And CDPR <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-cd-projekt-q3-2023-sees-strong-sales-and-strategic-growth-93CH-3947581">confirmed earlier this year</a> that <em>The Witcher 4</em> would not launch in 2026, extending the window for when we can expect all these promised new games.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise is the absence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> from the top 40. Yep, despite the latest Kirby game almost squeaking inside the top ten last week, the Switch 2 sequel has unfortunately slipped out of the top completely.</p>
<p>The top ten is very similar to last week, with a few new (returning) additions. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> has seen the biggest jump in numbers, going from 24th last week to 6th this week; most of those sales have come from the PC and PS5 versions, but the Switch 2 release has pulled in a solid 9% of sales. Similarly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026 Edition</a>, a Switch 1 exclusive, has also made a huge leap, going from 27th to 9th this week.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067glxmvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> (With 21% on sold Switch 1, and 8% on Switch 2), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> have all retained their spots from last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has swapped places with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> for 4th. The Switch 1 and Switch 2 split remains close there, with 54% opting for the Switch 1 version, while the remaining 46% grab it on Switch 2. This obviously doesn't include those who buy the Upgrade Pack separately.</p>
<p>So, business as usual, then! Perhaps <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will shake things up next week, hm?

            <p>
I can only assume that Halloween's proximity to Christmas is the reason as to why there is so much winter holiday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> media. Perhaps it's even just as simple as the fact that people like it when Christmas is a little bit messed up! Either way, I do actually enjoy some Chrimbo horror, so I'm pleased to see the return of Haunted PS1's Madvent Calendar this year, which just so happens to have launched today.
</p>
<p>
For those that need the rundown on how the whole thing works, it's essentially a package of 24 different games, all vaguely horrory and Christmassy in one way or another. This year's iteration, Madvent Calendar 5: Post Mortem, is no different, bringing with it a gaggle of goodies that, I should note, are varying degrees of polished. Expect the kind of bits you might see in a game jam, basically.

You can play every single game on offer as soon as it's been downloaded, though that technically defeats the point of an advent calendar. Still, to give you an idea of what to expect, I'll run you through a few of the games on offer. Spoiler warning I suppose? Stand clear if you want to discover them for yourself!
</p><p>
Day one puts you in a fuzzy, pixelated world where you can do two things: rip, and knock. It throws you in with little context, making it genuinely quite unnerving. Sort of felt like I was being born at one point? Weird stuff! Another entry puts you in the role of a zombie girl who has been recruited by an eye-patch wearing Santa to help with the war on Christmas. This one's kind of a cross between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> and Spyro, and is just quite a little neat 3D platformer that with some extra finessing could feature some solid movement mechanics.
</p>
<p>
I'm always a fan of all the Haunted PS1 demo discs, their Madvent Calendars, and the odd one of projects too. It's a real boon of bite sized creativity, and well worth dipping into if the holiday season feels just a tad too cheerful for your liking. You can pick it up for free on itch.io right <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/madvent5">here</a>.

              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-film-sequel-confirmed-march-spring-2027-sega-1851744323"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</span></i></a> <span>is coming in 2027, but it looks like another live-action </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>movie is coming not too long after. Is this the rumored Shadow-centric spin-off we’ve been hearing about? It better be, Paramount.</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>, Paramount has added a new “Sonic Universe Event Film” to its schedule that will premiere on December 22, 2028, four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a> <span>debuted last December. </span><i><span>Variety </span></i><span>notes this movie will be a spin-off, which means it likely won’t follow the blue blur and his friends. There have been longstanding </span><a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/articles/sonic/rumor-shadow-movie-officially-in-development-at-paramount-they-want-to-do-an-amy-rose-project-r3181/"><span>rumors</span></a><span> that a spin-off movie about Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic’s black-and-red rival played by Keanu Reeves, was on the table if </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </span></i><span>did well, and it got around half a billion at the box office.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Shadow was the antagonist of most of </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>, and seemingly sacrificed himself to stop his original plan to destroy the world. The movie’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285"><span>final post-credits scene</span></a><span> shows him recovering his inhibitor rings that fell to Earth in the film’s climactic space battle, implying that he would return in a future movie or television series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What we know so far about </span><i><span>Sonic 4 </span></i><span>makes it sound like Shadow won’t be in the next numbered film, so a spin-off starring him would be the next best thing. Could this be when the film series finally introduces the other members of Shadow’s Team Dark: treasure hunter Rouge the Bat and Eggman’s estranged robot Omega E-123? Please, Paramount. I need Shadow to find his new family after losing everything in </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever this movie is, it will premiere just about a year and a half after </span><i><span>Sonic 4</span></i><span>, which is set for theaters on March 19, 2027. The fourth film will focus on newcomers Metal Sonic and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058"><span> Amy Rose</span></a><span>, who were teased in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775"><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>’s post-credits scene</span></a><span>, and seems to be a loose adaptation of </span><i><span>Sonic CD</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nightreign‘s Deadliest Field Boss Is Not Who I Expected]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreigns-bell-bearing-carion-draconic-tree-sentinel-2000649218</link>
            <guid>1369717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC, <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">is out later this week</a>. Ahead of its release, publisher Bandai Namco spilled the beans on which of the roguelike multiplayer game’s field bosses have killed players the most. Anyone who has played for any length of time probably expected Bell Bearing Hunter to be crowned the most deadly, but that honor has actually gone to the Royal Carian Knight. Quiet frankly, I don’t believe it.</p> <p>The newly released info graphic lists the “<a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-eye-of-the-storm-infographic">8 most deadly field bosses</a>.” Field bosses are the major enemies that exist at various points on the map during the day. Strong ones give players better loot and more levels. Also an early grave. Here’s the ranking according to Bandai Namco:</p>

 <ol> <li>Royal Carian Knight</li> <li>Draconic Tree Sentinel</li> <li>Erdtree Avatar</li> <li>Bell Bearing Hunter</li> <li>Pot-Troll</li> <li>Black Blade Kindered</li> <li>Death Rite Bird</li> <li>Ulcerated Tree Spirit</li> </ol> <figure id="attachment_2000649223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649223"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649223">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The top two aren’t completely out of left field. Both horseback bosses have tons of mobility, are brutal up close, and will wreck you with long-ranged magic attacks, especially if you’re trying to escape. Most of the times I’ve died to one of them, I wasn’t even trying to fight them, just climb up a cliff. Erdtree Avatar is a little more surprising to me. He’s brutal if you’re not ready to fight him, but pretty predictable and easy to avoid once you’ve got decent levels and equipment. So is Death Rite Bird at number seven. I always avoid the Bird at all costs.</p>

 <p>Speaking of avoiding bosses, that brings us to Bell Bearing Hunter. The unsuspecting field boss walks softly but carries a big sword. Many a <em>Nightreign</em> player has encountered him, though “oh yeah, I got this,” and then after landing their first attack and nearly being one-shotted in response, immediately realized “oh no, I actually don’t got this at all.” He’s become a meme in the community for being the one boss everyone knows to avoid. You can tell you’re playing with a new player if you encounter Bell Bearing and they don’t immediately keep running.</p>

 <p>So what’s he doing at number four? There are two possibilities here. 1.) He’s not actually the hardest, and despite his legendary status on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit and Discord, players have a way harder time with the Royal Carian Knight and Draconic Tree Sentinel. Or 2.) Bell Bearing has killed fewer players because they never bother fighting him to begin with. It all comes down to whether Bandai Namco is measuring total body count or averaging those proportional to the actual number of encounters. Carian Knight might have killed more players, while Bell Bearing actually has a higher win-rate against them.</p> <p>I’ve asked Bandai Namco for clarification. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">mythmaking around <em>Nightreign</em>‘s most legendary boss</a> is at stake. All I know for sure is that when <em>The Forsaken</em> <em>Hollows</em> goes live on December 4, I’m running past both Carian Knight <em>and</em> Bell Bearing.</p>
