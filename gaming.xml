			<p>Avowed, the latest roleplaying game by Obsidian Entertainment and the first they published under Xbox Game Studios, has been officially out for three days. The first real data on player concurrency will come in this weekend, as the game will presumably reach a new peak on Steam, but in the meantime, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tidbit as part of their interview with Game Director Carrie Patel: Obsidian is happy with sales so far.</p>
<p>In the conversation with Bloomberg, Patel went over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-has-had-a-reboot-of-sorts-and-may-be-further-away-than-anticipated-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reboot</a> that happened in 2021, when she took over from the prior director.</p>
<p><em>I feel like I've learned so much over the past four years that I wish I'd known at the start of this process. It's definitely been a job where the highs are really high and the lows are really low. Normally, if you're stepping back and reevaluating your creative direction, putting together a new vertical slice and revised production plans, you would do that with a very small team. We did not have a very small team at that point. A lot of lessons we learned as we were building Avowed, ideally we would've learned on a small scale with a true preproduction.</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest changes brought by the reboot was downsizing from a Skyrim-like open world to something more akin to the studio's previous productions. On this subject, Patel said:</p>
<p><em>With any game, you think, 'Ok, we can't climb every mountain - which ones are really worth the effort for us? We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with 'open zones', and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next.</em></p>
<p>Patel also ended with a seemingly hopeful sentence about potential sequels for Avowed:</p>
<p><em>Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it.</em></p>
<p>She previously worked on Pillars of Eternity, so it's likely she was referring not generally to the world of Eora but specifically to this action version rather than those cRPGs. Of course, whether she gets her wish will mostly depend on Microsoft's assessment of the sales and overall reception.</p>

As a reminder, Obsidian is also working with a separate team on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is slated to launch late this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

                <p>Avowed was originally going to have multiplayer components, similar to that of Destiny where players could walk around in a massive world.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MDE2MDg3MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwNzY1NjcyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUzFPT0xUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.FhUrXseBBb83k69Ovuo9PgY3sOuBdW-owuWeanAYc5o&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, director Carrie Patel said that Obsidian Entertainment pitched Avowed as a cross between Destiny and Skyrim to prospective buyers, which ended with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-acquires-fallout-new-vegas-star-wars-knights-/1100-6463175/" data-ref-id="1100-6463175">Microsoft purchasing the studio</a>. Avowed's development started in 2018 but went through two reboots, which led Obsidian to scrap its multiplayer component.</p><p>The second reboot occurred in January 2021, when Obsidian replaced Avowed's leadership as they were about to enter production. Patel initiated two major pivots to Avowed, the first of which was to focus on its story and lore from the Pillars of Eternity universe. The second was to replace Avowed's original open world with open-zone ones, similar to that of Obsidian's The Outer Worlds. The latter decision was made so that the development team could create more distinct and denser spaces.</p><p>As a result, the development team had to scale back in creating large and sprawling maps like Skyrim. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with 'open zones' and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player’s going from one environment to the next," Patel explained.</p><p>Patel also said that the team is happy with Avowed's sales numbers so far. Although Patel wouldn't reveal what her team's next project is, we do know that Obsidian Entertainment is currently working on The Outer Worlds 2. Initially announced in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-gameplay-trailer-debuts-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528439/" data-ref-id="1100-6528439">Obsidian released its first gameplay trailer at The Game Awards 2024</a>. The game is set for release sometime this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Avowed is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Game Pass. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/avowed-review/2300-6465692/" data-ref-id="2300-6465692">Avowed review</a>, we said, "Avowed's impactful and satisfying combat is undone by a widely unbalanced upgrade system and an uninteresting story that wastes its potential."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/617373/south-of-midnight-preview-interview-ahmed-best<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It was hard playing a preview of <em>South of Midnight</em> because, 20 minutes in, I just started bawling. The demo for the action-adventure platformer starts at the beginning of chapter three. The protagonist, Hazel, is working her way through a swamp trying to find her mother, who, along with their house, had been washed away in a hurricane. At the same time, she comes to learn her newfound powers as a Weaver — a person who can manipulate the metaphysical strands that connect all life — from the ghostly echoes of an enslaved woman who used her powers to escape to freedom and help others do the same.</p><p>With all that weighing on me, I held it together pretty well. But as I went through the double jump tutorial, a choir started singing a hymn in the background and I just lost it. It wasn’t that it was an emotional hymn; I didn’t even recognize it. But I <em>knew</em> the song was of me and for me even without having heard it before. That’s the kind of cultural weight the developers at Xbox studio Compulsion Games have invested in <em>South of Midnight.</em></p><p>The authenticity that oozes from the game was intentionally cultivated. Its story draws upon American Southern Gothic folklore, which itself is a mix of tales and characters from indigenous, African, Creole, and Cajun traditions. Nailing the tone of such a rich and nuanced tradition in a respectful way was important to the narrative team. “If we’re going to tell the story, we have to go to the source,” Zaire Lanier, a writer on <em>South of Midnight</em>, told me.</p><p>Lanier spoke of the reference trips the development team took to Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi. She and the other members of the narrative team drew on their own experiences growing up in the American South and consulted with experts versed in Black southern traditions, like award-winning children’s author and storyteller Donna Washington. They applied this principle not just to the game’s narrative, but elsewhere as well.</p><p>“Same thing with the music, our audio director and our composer, we went straight to the source,” Lanier said. She explained how the team consulted with blues and other southern artists and told me that the performance that ultimately caused my joyful breakdown was a Nashville gospel children’s choir.</p><p>Voice and motion capture performance also benefited from Compulsion’s quest for authenticity. “The thing that I really love about Compulsion ... is the fact that they were like, ‘we know what we don’t know,’” said Ahmed Best, director of <em>South of Midnight</em>’s voice and motion capture performance. Best is most known for his role as Jar Jar Binks in the<em> Star Wars </em>prequel trilogy but has spent decades directing films and teaching directing at the University of Southern California. <em>South of Midnight</em> is his first time in the director’s chair for a video game. </p><p>“I was very happy that they were looking for African American voices and direction,” Best said. </p><p>But hiring Black voice performers, as Compulsion did for a lot of the cast — including Hazel and her mother, with Best lending his voice to the project as well — is only half of the equation.</p><p>“Physical behavior is just as much of a storytelling tool as the script,” Best said. He spoke about working on bringing Hazel to life through her movements, right down to the specific way she stands. Nailing something as simple as how an actor stands is a detail most players will likely miss, but for Best, that’s okay. “That’s kind of the point,” he said. “The point is for it to kind of be invisible to everybody else. It’s the subtleties that you capture in motion capture, and it’s the subtleties you capture in voices that really put the authenticity over the top,” Best explained.</p><p>The reason Compulsion’s quest for authenticity comes off so well is a curious mix of humility and ambition. In my conversations with Lanier and Best, they each expressed the sentiment, “we don’t know what we don’t know,” regarding the team’s approach to <em>South of Midnight</em>’s storytelling. Compulsion is headquartered in Montreal, Canada — an area not particularly known for its gumbo, if you know what I mean.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> could have been about anything, but its team chose to tell a story rooted in a culture not often depicted in video games. Then, rather than relying on personal anecdotes and generalities to tell that story, Compulsion empowered its developers to go find and heed the subject matter experts. That effort shines so brightly and thoroughly that it got me sobbing on the strength of its 90-minute preview alone — I can’t wait for the full game to utterly destroy me.</p><p><sub><em>South of Midnight</em> launches on Xbox, Game Pass, and PC on April 8th.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-bond-franchise-sale-to-amazon-mgm-is-probably-bad-news-but-here-are-some-ways-it-could-work<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In landmark entertainment news that left James Bond fans feeling shaken, not stirred, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-mgm-takes-creative-control-over-the-james-bond-franchise"><u>Amazon MGM Studios has taken full control of the 007 franchise</u></a> from long-time producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. While there are plenty of reasons to worry here, the fact of the matter is that there are already spinoff books, games, comics, etc, etc, not to mention the original novels by Ian Fleming. Dozens of writers, actors, artists, and more have tackled James Bond and his extended cast. And with Amazon’s <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/james-bond-amazon-mgm-studios-deal-1236296104/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported ambitions</u></a> to turn James Bond into a “universe,” a la Marvel and Star Wars, and billions of dollars at stake, the Bond franchise has no time to die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, this was one of Broccoli’s concerns in giving up the rights, that Amazon MGM would try to expand too quickly or cast a name actor in the role of the secret agent. Will Amazon hold true to these ideals, or are we about to get Timothée Chalamet as the next 007? Likely not the latter (all apologies to Chalamet), but Amazon has already tried to create their own spy franchise with the Russo Brothers produced Citadel, and international spinoffs Citadel: Diana and Citadel: Honey Bunny. Those have generally lacked critical acclaim (except for Honey Bunny), and at least domestically haven’t really broken through to audiences in the same way as other Amazon hits like The Boys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">…Or more to the point, Amazon’s dudes with guns shows like Reacher, Jack Ryan, and Bosch. In fact, one could posit this is a large part of the reasoning behind Amazon shelling out a billion dollars more to own Bond: some of their most successful series have already been white men, with guns, their names in the title, based on book series. Unlike the money Amazon plunked down for Lord of the Rings (your mileage may vary on how successful Rings of Power has been), buying James Bond outright based on the data available is one of the safest purchases Amazon could make. Prime Video audiences already flock to shows about guys <em>like</em> James Bond, so why not James Bond himself?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One other detail you might not be aware of: Amazon already made a James Bond TV show. Seriously. Titled 007: Road to a Million, the reality game show streamed in 2023, was hosted by Brian Cox, and was picked up for a second season before the first even hit Prime Video. Only tangentially related to Bond by the idea that Cox is playing a pseudo-Bond villain while contestants race to win one million pounds, the series wasn’t a big hit but it does show that Amazon has already played in the TV space with 007. And as just one extra funny tidbit, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/brian-cox-joined-007-road-to-a-million-next-james-bond-movie-1235640137/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Cox thought he was signing up for the next Bond movie</u></a>. He was not, so maybe Amazon could do right by him in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, there’s more! Back in 1954, an anthology series titled Climax! aired the first-ever adaptation of “Casino Royale,” the Ian Fleming novel, before it was later committed to film multiple times. Point being, there’s not <em>much</em> of a history of TV for James Bond, but just as the franchise has had some of its most lauded installments in video games (have you ever played GoldenEye for the N64?), comics, and more, James Bond isn’t quite the sacred cow we think of, when it comes to adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mind you, there have been no announcements that Amazon is forgoing film entirely, and likely they won’t. MGM isn’t the studio it once was, but for every Red One that hits theaters, they still have the Oscar-nominated Nickel Boys. There’s plenty of reason to believe that even without the Broccolis, Amazon MGM will aim to do right by the Bond franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Spy Movies</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And frankly, is there anything that is out of left field about the idea of a franchise extension? While perhaps cutting Bond theatrically entirely and instead doing a TV streaming version of Bond might be the ultimate nightmare of cinephiles, there is a wealth of fascinating characters who revolve around Bond that often have far more chance of character growth than the main character himself. Bond, over decades, has remained relatively static – the recent Craig movies aside – while Q, M, Moneypenny, and even Felix Leiter always seem to have a lot more going on between the scene or two Bond spends checking in with them per film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Would a series where Q has to go out of the lab and use his own gadgets be so terrible? How about Felix having to deal with the fallout of Bond blowing up the latest supervillain plot on the American side? And given the wealth of villains and henchmen in the Bond universe who have inspired dozens of fanfics, tributes, and knockoffs, an anthology series that gave them each more time in the sun could be a lot of fun. Who hasn’t wondered how Jaws got those jaws?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also an opportunity here to flesh out the character of James Bond through a serialized TV show in a way that has not, for the most part, been afforded the character on the big screen. Aside from the rare instance where Bond suffers a sprained ankle at the beginning of the movie, the character has been functionally immortal, down to switching his face like a Time Lord. It wasn’t until the recent Daniel Craig films that Bond was allowed to have some sort of growth, though even then it was relegated to “bummed about the death of his girlfriend” for the majority of the Craig movies, and “old” in the last one.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/10/07/36190303jamesbond-lasttimeblogroll-1633478033903-1633635928198.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The lone exception is Skyfall, arguably the best Bond movie of all time… Because it truly challenged James emotionally and moved the series forward to almost a logical conclusion. The next movie reset things in many ways, but imagine being able to see that kind of arc over 10, 20, or even 30 episodes (we’re not going to go crazy and suggest a streaming show go a full 22 episodes a season or anything like that)? You likely won’t get 10 Skyfalls in a row, but if you can get some nods to the ambition of that film in there, viewers could be in for something truly special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The flip side is that Amazon could not look to the obvious – i.e. their dudes with guns shows – and instead take the route of Lord of the Rings, and deliver a prequel all leading up to the birth of James Bond. To that, perhaps they need look no further than Pennyworth, a goofy show with a host of loyal fans that nevertheless confused casual viewers as to why we were getting a show about Batman’s future butler. Or, for example, The Rings of Power, a show with a hot Sauron and virtually no rings in the first season that tested the patience of even the most loyal fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the potential nightmare scenario, that Amazon will think with their algorithm instead of their heart. Even at their worst, there’s a charm the Broccoli family and others managed to bring to the Bond franchise, with the same rhythms, the same big explosion, the same good girl gone bad and bad girl gone good, time and again. In the streaming era, we’re far from the place where you could deliver the poetry of a Bond movie on an episodic basis. To turn it into yet another serialized spy drama (or worse, a serialized prequel spy drama) risks making it lose that specialness and instead slot in with Netflix’s The Night Agent, The Diplomat, and The Recruit, or god help us Citadel, instead of being its own, unique thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the trick, really, and it is with any potential cinematic universe: what makes it different? In Bond’s case, up until now, it was that it existed mostly on the big screen, every few years, and delivered a level of action spectacle and plot comfort that TV has been creeping on for decades. If Amazon does want to turn the house Ian Fleming built into a multi-platform franchise, then they need to reckon with what makes Bond so unique. If they can figure that formula out, and perhaps build out that supporting cast, too (Ben Whishaw in a Q series? Come on!), then rather than the death sentence some fans have called this deal, the Bond franchise will die another day.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/netease-founder-reportedly-almost-canceled-marvel-rivals-because-it-didnt-use-original-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The canceled cancelation effort is said to have cost NetEase millions.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase's Marvel Rivals can't be described as anything less than a hit, netting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">ten million players in just three days from launch</a> and raking in millions for developer NetEase in the weeks since. But a new report suggests that NetEase CEO and founder William Ding nearly canceled the game due to a reluctance to use licensed IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comes from Bloomberg</a>, and describes the current situation at NetEase: Ding is actively cutting jobs, closing studios, and withdrawing from investment overseas. The goal, per the report, is a smaller, tighter portfolio that can stave off a recent growth decline and compete with rivals Tencent and MiHoYo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that shrinking, Bloomberg reports, almost included canceling Marvel Rivals. According to one source, Ding didn't want to pay for the use of licensed Marvel characters, and tried to persuade artists to use original designs instead. An attempted cancelation allegedly cost NetEase millions, but the game released anyway to its current success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the shrinking continues. Just earlier this week, we learned that the Marvel Rivals Seattle team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-director-and-entire-seattle-design-team-laid-off-netease-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-the-game">was laid off</a>, with the company claiming this was for "organizational reasons." And over the last year, Ding has ceased investment in overseas projects, having previously invested heavily in Japanese and Western studios like Bungie, Devolver Digital, and Blizzard Entertainment. The report suggests that Ding believes games that won't generate hundreds of millions per year are not worth the company's time, though a company spokesperson told Bloomberg that NetEase doesn’t set "arbitrary blanket numbers for determining the viability of a new game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Workers speaking to Bloomberg also painted a portrait of trouble internally at NetEase, centered around Ding's volatility as a leader. Per this account, Ding is quick to make decisions and changes his mind often, has pressured staff to work late, recently hired a number of recent graduates into prominent leadership roles, and has allegedly shut down so many projects that NetEase may not release any games in China next year at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase's withdrawal from games investment comes at a time of ongoing uncertainty in the games industry, especially in the West. <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2023" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple</a> <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">years</a> <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running</a> have seen mass layoffs, cancellations, and studio shut downs, alongside a number of expensive and high-profile games flopping despite high company expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

			<p>NetEase made waves in all the wrong ways when it decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lay off developers</a> at its Western Marvel Rivals studio despite the fact that the game was an absolute smash hit with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 40 million players to date</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a fresh report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Bloomberg</a> alleges that the Chinese company suffered many abrupt changes mandated by its founder and CEO, William Ding, who cut hundreds of jobs and suddenly pulled back its massive foreign investment. As a reminder, over the last few years, NetEase has invested in many studios based in North America, Europe, and Japan, such as:</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/behaviour-interactive-receives-strategic-investment-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behaviour Interactive</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/suda-grasshopper-manufacture-has-joined-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture (wholly owned)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-minecraft-studio-skybox-labs-netease-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skybox Labs (wholly owned)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-devs-defect-found-jar-of-sparks-new-studio-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jar of Sparks (founded by former Halo and Destiny veteran Jerry Hook)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-for-pc-console-in-development-at-jackalyptic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackalyptic Games (founded by former MMO veteran Jack Emmert)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-entertainment-is-a-new-netease-studio-founded-by-bioware-bethesda-mmo-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-Minus Zero (founded by former BioWare and Bethesda veterans)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Untold (founded by former Mass Effect lead Mac Walters)</a></p>

<p>Of these, Jar of Sparks and Worlds Untold already had their funding cut by NetEase a few months ago, and the heads are now desperately looking for another publisher and source of funding. Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was also shut down</a> despite the game's launch to positive reviews. And now, other Japanese studios like Nagoshi's have just been given the time required to complete current projects. There won't be any additional funding or time allotted by NetEase, and the Chinese publisher has no plans to spend any money on marketing or promoting the games currently in production in Japan.</p>
<p>Other NetEase-backed Western studios on that list are also reportedly seeking new publishers, including Jackalyptic, which is making a Warhammer MMORPG (which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to Jack Emmert</a> about after its announcement). This game was recently shown at a trade event to partners and received a positive response, so there's hope it will find a new home.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has become one of the most popular game releases of the past year, averaging over 250,000 daily players on Steam since its December release. But according to a new report from Bloomberg, there was a time where that might never have happened.</p>



<p>In a report on NetEase CEO William Ding, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg sources</a> told the outlet that there were discussions about Marvel Rivals being canceled ahead of its launch. According to those with knowledge of the situation, Ding was against paying Disney for the rights to use the Marvel characters. </p>



<p>Ding even had artists begin creating original characters to use instead. While it didn’t move forward permanently, the short-lived decision “cost the company millions of dollars and was emblematic of the abrupt changes ushered in by the CEO.”</p>



<p>For what its worth, NetEase denies the claims and says that they’ve “enjoyed a close partnership with Marvel since 2017.”</p>



<p>NetEase has been in the news quite a bit recently after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it laid off an entire</a> United States-based team. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-releases-statement-on-marvel-rivals-layoffs/">studio said the decision</a> was difficult, but that the company is committed to the future of the game.</p>



<p>“We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience,” NetEase said of the move.</p>



<p>“We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game.”</p>



<p>What do you think about claims that Marvel Rivals could have been canceled at NetEase? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

		<p>Sometimes you hear of a project that is so preposterous that you immediately dismiss it as it is never, ever going to come to fruition. I am not talking about climbing Everest or cycling around the globe – we know those can be achieved – I am talking about performing all of Shakespeare’s Hamlet in Grand Theft Auto Online. That barmy idea has made its way all the way through to now being available to <a href="https://mubi.com/en/us">stream on MUBI</a>!</p>
<p>How did this come about, though? As we entered the third Covid lockdown in January 2021, two out-of-work theatre actors Sam and Mark joined millions of others online and played<span> video games, specifically Grand Theft Auto Online. While exploring the map they stumbled across the Vinewood Bowl, a huge outdoor amphitheatre, and this backdrop planted an idea in their heads. They can’t act in real life, so why not put on a play inside Grand Theft Auto Online?</span></p>
<p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET | Official Trailer | Now Streaming on MUBI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OloHiBOMPm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>Hamlet was chosen, a decision which turned out to be more fortuitous than they could have imagined as they slowly discovered the world GTA Online, and how the perfect neon city hides a dark seedy underbelly of lies and deceit, themes that can also be found within play. “It’s got the same recognisability in theatre as GTA has to gamers,” said Sam “It’s glamorous but under the surface, there is a relentless focus on death.” Hamlet also has a play within the play, so staging a play within a game seems the obvious modern equivalent.</span></p>
<p>Sam brought in his partner, Penny, to document the entire process. Over 300 hours of footage were captured on PlayStation 5, shot completely within the game and without using the Director mode, so you can see the HUD, NPCs, and of course many players who have nothing to do with the film trying to murder the cast at every opportunity. The only thing that wasn’t done in-game was chopping it all up and editing it in Adobe to create the documentary film Grand Theft Hamlet.</p>

<p><span>“One major planning point was when the guys realized that they could do a promenade performance,” says Sam. “They didn’t have to stay in the amphitheatre they had found in the game. In fact, the whole of the game was a potential stage, and they could even utilize different vehicles to move between locations.”</span></p>

<p>The team start trying to recruit a cast for the play and gathered together not just actors, but full-time mothers, cooks, and an alien who offers to audition with his ass… but ends up reciting a passage from the Quran. It soon becomes clear that the documentary is not just about the play, but that so many of the cast across the globe are in the same situation, locked inside with no real human contact and we get to hear their personal stories of lockdown. It also shows just how positive video games can be, bringing a random group of people to create something new. “I do think there should be more films about the positivity of gaming,” said Penny, “I thought [gaming] was a negative place to begin with.”</p>
<p>There are some amusing moments when Sam, Penny and Mark meet an auditionee for the first time, but found the voice does not match the on-screen persona as the player has gender-swapped that avatar. I asked them if this was a help or hindrance when casting and they explained that made casting even easier. “We could do this gender neutral,” said Penny. “People’s flexibility in games meant it was easy to be flexible when casting.”</p>

<p>There are also many, many laugh-out-loud moments throughout Grand Theft Hamlet, something you don’t often expect in a documentary, but as the team had no control over NPCs or other players, they often found squads of police cars racing into their rehearsal space. A solution came in the shape of some volunteers players who acted as the play’s own security force, taking down any players who were encroaching on the scene. I’m not sure what Shakespeare would have made of his soliloquies being recited by Hamlet while a jet patrols the skies above, its chain gun thundering and blowing up incoming helicopters, but I loved it.</p>
<p>None of what the Penny, Mark and Sam have created makes any sense; Hamlet in GTA Online should not work, the idea should have been shut down before it was even suggested. Somehow it does, the documentary is funny and touching, but also shows that people with no existing connections whatsoever, people from different countries and all backgrounds, can work together and make something beautiful. Given what is going on across the planet these days it’s nice to be reminded that, even in murderous world of GTA Online, there are good guys.</p>

Team D-13's top-down sci-fi shoot ‘em up originally debuted on Steam as “Monolith.” The re-branding seems to be partly about giving the indie gem a catchier name, and also partly about avoiding potential legal trouble with Warner Bros. Games, who has the original title trademarked for its studio of the same name.</p><p>But for many, <em>Star of Providence </em>will essentially be their first introduction to the roguelike’s striking retro art style and vast array of enemies, weapons, and secrets.

In this game, Shotgun Cop Man must travel to hell and arrest Satan.</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man's main mechanic revolves around propelling the titular character using firearms across levels and platforms. Its simplistic and minimalist art style complements its chaotic gameplay, allowing players to keep track of incoming bullets while also leaving room for players to make last-minute decisions on how to evade them. Solo dev DeadToast Entertainment said that adding on extra visual flair only increased "cognitive load," leading to a decrease in gameplay flow.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWSNEN2mZH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I mentioned earlier the simplicity of the shotgun-propelling being something that spoke to me. And I wanted to stick with that word, simplicity, and try to make a game where I could strip away or minimize anything that wasn’t contributing to that core flowy feel and experience," DeadToast explained. "Hence the minimalist look and straightforward nature of the game."</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man also includes a level editor, which was one of My Friend Pedro's most-requested features. All of Shotgun Cop Man's levels are built with the same level-editor tools that players will have access to in the full release through Steam Workshop. There will also be No Damage and Speedrun modes for hardcore players.</p><p>The game will cost $10 when it launches on PC and Switch later this year, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">demo is now available on Steam</a>. It contains 17 levels for players to go through. It wasn't revealed whether Shotgun Cop Man would get PlayStation and Xbox releases, but My Friend Pedro eventually came <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-friend-pedro-comes-to-ps4-next-week/1100-6475317/" data-ref-id="1100-6475317">to all platforms</a>, so it's possible that Shotgun Cop Man will too.</p><p>It's also possible that Shotgun Cop Man will be playable on Switch 2, but it's currently unclear what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">upcoming system's backwards compatibility limitations are</a>.</p>
