			<p>Yet again, there are more layoffs. This time, Activision Blizzard are the ones responsible, and they will soon be laying off nearly 400 people in the mobile gaming divisions of their company, which are located in Santa Monica and Irvine. By doing this, it eliminates redundancies among the staff after their expensive merge with Microsoft last year, which cost $75.4 billion.</p>
<p>It's hardly surprising anymore when <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">Activision Blizzard lays off staff</a>, as they have already laid off 1,003 staff in the past year, with staff being from Novato, Foster City, and Southern California, as stated by filings with the Employment Development Department.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard has told the EDD that 140 jobs were to be scrapped beginning October 11 at the <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/irvine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blizzard Entertainment studio in Irvine</a>. The jobs that are being eliminated in Irvine cover a large variety of positions in the company, according to a letter filed by Leslie Campbell, who is the Director of Activision Blizzard's Human Resources department. The jobs being eliminated include accountants, software engineers, the Director of HR for World of Warcraft, artists, game producers, and many more. The jobs eliminated weren't exclusively junior roles either, as a Game Director and Vice President were also on the list of those being laid off from Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard spokeswoman Delay Simmons said that the company was unable to share additional details about "which teams were impacted and their locations," which she pointed to the slew of media reports on the two previous rounds of major layoffs.</p>
<p>January saw 1,900 layoffs made within the Microsoft Gaming divisions Activision Blizzard, Xbox and ZeniMax. Then earlier in September, Microsoft Gaming announced a further 650 layoffs.</p>
<p>Regarding the most recent layoffs, she states, "The 400 roles you're seeing in the system are part of the recent news and are not new; the roles that were impacted include mostly corporate and supporting roles and some impacts to gaming teams." The layoffs are said to be coming in waves, with the first happening at Irvine and Santa Monica studios on October 11 and Playa Vista layoffs happening in November. It's said that all layoffs at the three locations should be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>With Microsoft's current finances from their gaming divisions specifically, it's possible that there will be even more layoffs in the future, but it can only be hoped that this doesn't happen. There have already been an astounding number of layoffs this year, and there are still three months left in the year, which could see the number rise even higher.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-review-%E2%80%93-running-out-of-quarters.994965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-review-running-out-of-quarters<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> keeps inching up to being a great time. It has all the retro energy and pop of a retro arcade brawler. Its pixel art and style are pure Saturday morning cartoon cheese. But it's an energy and drive that can't be sustained. It leads to an experience that, despite having some novel replay value, lacks that extra something to make it stellar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=kz13sCSl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=D-3DPh__ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's decent in stills, but that's about it.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra Review</em> – Are You A Good Enough Joe To Beat Cobra High Command?</h2>
<p>The opening of <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> is a microcosm of the game's overall presentation. The intro cutscene is animated in the style of a 1980s GI Joe cartoon and features a brand new heavy metal theme song that is pretty awesome. But as the cutscene continues, it falls into a weird nostalgic uncanny valley. It starts with VHS distortion effects and bombastic military spectacle. Then it ends with some stiff animations that are less cheesy and more cheap. As for that new intro, it gets abruptly cut off by the main menu music.</p>
<p>The Story Mode is a tissue-thin Greatest Hits album of the cartoon. Cobra wants to take over the world, go stop them. You play as one of four characters: Duke, Scarlet, Roadblock, or Snake Eyes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-character-select.jpg?itok=1_BxX8b_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-character-select.jpg?itok=5Qa_pXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, time to go punch all of terrorism in the face.</figcaption></figure><p>Like most recent retro revivals, each character has unique attacks and a special super move. Duke has straightforward drop kicks and a devastating air strike. Scarlet can flip, power slide, and fire paralyzing crossbow bolts. Snake Eyes has wide-sweeping sword slashes and can summon his wolf, Timber, to help. And Roadblock has ground slams and can pull out a gatling gun.</p>
<p>As for the game feel, it is (sorry, not sorry) quite punchy. There's a satisfying amount of juice packed with each hit, punctuated better with just the right amount of gamepad rumble. Enemies are launched with strong hits and ping around the screen like ping-pong balls. Mini-bosses crumple and explode like robotic confetti.</p>
<p>If you can imagine a licensed button-basher developed for the Sega Genesis, <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> is what it would have looked like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-snake-eyes-on-cobra-ship.jpg?itok=e0WasKbC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-snake-eyes-on-cobra-ship.jpg?itok=lzSlLcjH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Conservation of Ninjutsu states these mooks are going to have a bad time.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> Review – Porkchop Knuckle Sandwiches</h2>
<p>There are twelve levels in <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra's</em> story mode. And for roughly half of those levels, I was having a good time. There was a steady stream of health items and weapon pick-ups: assault rifles, shotguns, and grenade launchers. Plus, the game's soundtrack is catchy thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sonic-mania-review-breaking-cycle" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sonic Mania</em></a> composer Tee Lopes.</p>
<p>Enemy encounters escalated naturally, introducing at least one new enemy type at each level. Each fight against Cobra High Command felt thematic and challenging. A personal highlight is that Tomax and Xamot share the same health bar.</p>
<p>But that forward momentum goes from a brisk sprint to a laborious hike. After it reaches a natural climax in a fight with Cobra Commander, the game goes for about four more levels. Each one feels like the kind of artificial difficulty designed to drain quarters in an arcade. Palette swapped enemies. Annoying, hard-hitting overlapping attacks. Uninspired “dark” versions of the Joes as boss fights. They're all here, and it all feels like killing time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-roadblock-shooting-mech.jpg?itok=jnbsSKT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-roadblock-shooting-mech.jpg?itok=IRiEUpQC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to break ol' Painless out.</figcaption></figure><p>As these later levels drag on, they draw attention to the small but crucial ways <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> treads water. Despite each level referencing memorable storylines from <em>GI Joe</em>, they're mostly set dressing; nostalgic wallpaper lining interchangeable corridors full of mooks. Fighting a bunch of Cobra Trubble Bubbles and Viper tanks happens the same way in Springfield as it does on Cobra's moon base. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the combat is satisfyingly simple, the overall presentation doesn't escalate or dramatically change. No vehicle or turret sections. No ticking clock escape sequences. No vertical elevator sections. It's just corridor fistfights end to end.</p>
<p>These criticisms may seem unfair. After all, there's not much you can do with a sidescrolling beat 'em up. Their simplicity is part of their charm. But with its appeals to nostalgia and modern spins on old gameplay, <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> compares unfavorably to another retro love letter: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-shop-screenshot.jpg?itok=NcJfoptN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-shop-screenshot.jpg?itok=r2HN3dYS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I would need help, but I wouldn't say no to this modifier.</figcaption></figure><p>The one silver lining to the game is it has unlockable extras. As you play, you will pick up floppy discs, which can be used in the game's shop to unlock new modes. These include game modifiers like a one-hit mode, an arcade mode, and a boss rush mode. You can even unlock two more playable Joes: Ripcord and Gung Ho.</p>
<p>But unlocking everything will take a while. I have played through the entire Story Mode twice and got enough floppy discs to buy two things. It's a grind, but the additional features do add some replay value to the whole experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-cobra-commander-boss-fight.jpg?itok=Hqnpqn5Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-cobra-commander-boss-fight.jpg?itok=wsTN1Hc- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of these days I'll learn to block.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> Review – Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The developers of <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> have stated they have plans to release free updates for the game after launch. Given how much the game loses its luster in the second half, I hope they can refine the game into something great.</p>
<p>But as it stands right now, it's a competent arcade throwback that runs out of steam, falls back on old ideas, and overstays its welcome. If you're in the mood for some classic <em>GI Joe</em> action, there are worse ways to spend an afternoon.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over the course of six hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review</em></p>

                <p>The Nintendo Museum is preparing to open in Kyoto, Japan, and it looks to be an incredible collection of Nintendo ephemera. But it is <em>also</em>, perhaps inadvertently, a way to settle age-old internet disputes, and it has already supplied a definitive answer to the question: Is Yoshi's Island (aka Super Mario World 2) a Yoshi game or a Mario game?</p><p>According to Dan Ryckert's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">impressions from a special press preview</a> of the museum, one exhibition room has space dedicated to specific franchises, separated into individual categories. The Mario franchise display was by far the largest, encompassing not just the plumber's solo adventures but also the various spin-offs like kart racers and sports games. But he also noticed that Yoshi's Island is not actually in the Mario display, and is rather included in a separate Yoshi franchise display.</p><p>So there you have it. According to Nintendo's official categorization, in a space dedicated to careful cultivation of its own history, Yoshi's Island is not a Mario game. If you had $20 riding on this very unlikely bet, now is your time to collect.</p><p>Granted, Ryckert also vowed to incessantly bother his Nintendo contacts until this so-called mistake is rectified, and we wouldn't underestimate his ability to annoy anyone into compliance. So it's very possible that Nintendo will recategorize, or just include Yoshi's Island in both franchises, as space allows.</p><p>Yoshi's Island stars Yoshi (or a series of Yoshis) as they ferry a baby Mario across colorful islands. It's available as part of the Super NES library on the Nintendo Switch Online service, so you can play it there to judge for yourself which franchise it best fits into.</p><p>For more on the Nintendo Museum, be sure to read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">detailed Nintendo Museum impressions</a>, and check out a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/behold-the-nintendo-museum-in-all-its-glory/2900-5804/" data-ref-id="2900-5804">gallery of the Nintendo Museum displays</a>.</p>

                <p>Red Candle Games has confirmed that its Sekiro-inspired metroidvania, Nine Sols, will be launching on PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox on November 26. The studio released a brand-new trailer, and the game is confirmed to be coming to Game Pass on release day too.</p><p>Nine Sols follows Yi, a hero who aims to overthrow the nine Sols, tyrannical rulers in the realm of New Kunlun. The developers have called the aesthetics of Nine Sols as "Taopunk," which combines futuristic cyberpunk elements with eastern fantasy and mythology. While the game features challenging parrying mechanics, there are options to modify damage dealt and damage received, making it much more approachable and less frustrating than the game it's inspired by.</p>

Luckily, things are a little less crowded now that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>has been pushed to February, but odds are you’re looking forward to at least some things coming out in the next few weeks. This is your last weekend to chip away at the backlog before inevitably adding something new to it. We have a few suggestions for how you can spend your off-time.<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X and S, PC<br><strong>Current goal: Make a handsome dwarf</strong></p><p>In the interest of keeping you all apprised of the goings on of my best friends and I, one of them took it upon themselves to buy the other two copies of <em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em> without prompt. Apparently, he saw it for himself and deemed that the others would love it based on the several days of game time that we previously dumped into a similar survival game about dwarves, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>. Rather than just return to that game, we are now spinning up new adventures in this one.</p><p>For those not in the know, <em>Return to Moria </em>is a first-person survival game set in the popular Tolkien fantasy universe. Set after the events of the books and films, it follows a party of dwarves who set out to reclaim the titular city, which previously fell to the Balrog that you see Gandalf fighting in <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>. In action, <em>Return to Moria </em>seems like a pretty straightforward survival game in which players mine through the dark tunnels of the abandoned city under the Misty Mountains, harvest resources to craft more advanced tools, and proceed through procedurally generated mines. Having sat in on a party chat when my buds were playing it, it seems like a fun enough time, but I’m going to finally check it out for myself when I find some time this weekend and see if the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>-ness<em> </em>of it all is a compelling enough hook. —Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S<br><strong>Current goal: Change the world</strong></p><p>Last month, I played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394">about four hours of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></span>, the upcoming fantasy RPG from the <em>Persona </em>team. Now, much of what I played is available to the public <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-free-demo-ps5-xbox-rpg-persona-6-1851657040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-free-demo-ps5-xbox-rpg-persona-6-1851657040">as a free demo</a></span> on your favorite online shop (though, you should read up on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-demo-stuttering-framerate-fix-pc-1851658147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-demo-stuttering-framerate-fix-pc-1851658147">some of the technical trouble folks are having on PC</a></span> before you download). This early slice of the game will take you through the fantastical world of the United Kingdom of Euchronia and your progress will carry over to the main game if you decide to jump in on October 11. <em>Metaphor </em>brings in a lot of the time management and social sim elements from <em>Persona</em>, as well as the smooth and stylish turn-based battle system that makes even the most complex fights breezy. While it’s built on the foundations of <em>Persona</em>, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> feels more grown up than its predecessors because it’s not about high school. The political drama seems pretty compelling in these early hours, and it seems to be planting seeds for a big meta reveal about the divides between fantasy and reality. These four hours had me hooked when I played them, and if you’re even vaguely interested in what Atlus is cooking, you lose nothing by checking out the demo. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Nintendo Switch</p><p><strong>Current goal: Make more bed bridges</strong></p><p>Sorry for being Mr. Obvious.

Um, well, I could tell the truth, I suppose, and admit that while I absolutely intend to play <em>Zelda</em> all weekend because I just spent a fortune on the game, the reality is I’m actually just going to play <em>Balatro </em>on my phone while feeling guilty about it.

It’s the way that, for each of its 50 games, there are three different goals to strive for. The easiest is usually earning a game’s “garden” item, an object that then goes into a garden where a little mascot character lives, puttering around in their house and yard and interacting with all the different items you’ve earned for them so far. Then comes earning a “gold” cart for the game, which typically happens when you beat it, and then there’s the highest achievement, earning the “cherry” cart, which usually demands you not only beat a game but do so with particular mastery or aplomb. For an arcade-style game, it might mean earning a certain number of points on your way to its conclusion, for instance, while in an adventure game, it may require snagging a particular item en route to victory. With so many games to swap between and so many goals to strive for, I always feel like I’m making progress toward <em>something</em>, even if some challenges still elude me.</p><p>In particular, this weekend I hope to make more progress in the dungeon-crawler <em>Valbrace</em> (I’m currently on floor 4), complete some more stages in the innovative sacrificial platformer <em>Mortol</em>, snag the cherry cart for the wonderfully summery arcade shooter <em>Seaside Drive</em>, and maybe complete my second escape from the planet in the resource-harvesting <em>Zelda</em>-like game <em>Pilot Quest</em>. <em>&nbsp;</em>An opening screen in <em>UFO 50 </em>shows the old machine for which these games were ostensibly released, captioned with the text, “PLAY FOREVER.” In the case of <em>UFO 50</em>, I think I just might.—Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>  <strong>Play it on:</strong> Steam, October 10<br><strong>Current goal: Win without using the aluminum bat</strong></p><p>The game that single-handedly kept me and my sister from losing our minds in childhood returns. <em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em> is releasing on Steam on October 10, but I’ve got an advanced copy, and boy, oh boy, am I just marinating in nostalgia. Sure, the ceaselessly repeated lines from the cast of kids playing pickup baseball get old <em>real</em> fast, and there are some <em>interesting</em> characterizations that are a clear reminder of how things were in the late ‘90s, but it’s an absolute blast playing <em>BB ‘97 </em>again.</p><p>The satisfying smack of the bat when you successfully hit one of the zany special pitches (like an actually wet spitball, a wild zig-zagging hurl, or a slow ball that temporarily freezes into an ice cube over the plate), the chaos that ensues when the fielders smack into each other when trying to make a play, the legend that is Pablo Sanchez—<em>Backyard Baseball</em> is still a total delight. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC (including Game Pass)<br><strong>Current goal: Keep political turmoil at bay</strong></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-should-be-playing-the-brutal-city-builder-frostpunk-1825656934&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-be-playing-the-brutal-city-builder-frostpunk-1825656934">I loved the first <em>Frostpunk</em></a></span>. It was an approachable city management sim that layered compelling and provocative story beats overtop an otherwise not too difficult-to-decipher resource balancing game.<em> Frostpunk 2</em> is much more complex, and taking me a lot longer to wrap my head around as a result. It’s a meatier and in some ways much more familiar settlement building experience, but it also has a fascinating and much more nuanced political sim operating in concert with it that adds a whole new set of opportunities and restrictions to navigate. I’m not sure if I’ll ultimately end up liking it as much as the first game, but so far it’s offered plenty for me to chew on and I still love the feeling of cozying up to its apocalyptic machinery amid an endless winter. —Ethan Gach<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following what could be the worst year ever for Ubisoft, the publisher announced it would delay Assassin’s Creed Shadows to February 2025. While the third-person action game is “feature complete,” they want to spend the next few months polishing the experience to ensure it’s the studio’s best launch. Unfortunately, for those excited to play as Yasuke and Naoe, it leaves a hole in the holidays. Here’s what you can play following the Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-new-assassin-s-creed-shadows-release-date">What is the New Assassin’s Creed Shadows Release Date?</h2>



<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the new release date for the third-person action game with stealth elements is <strong>February 14, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this means it will directly compete with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei in 2025</a>, along with a handful of major releases in February, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avowed</strong></li>



<li><strong>Civilization 7</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-games-to-play-after-the-assassin-s-creed-shadows-delay">Games to Play After the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Delay</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows promises a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive open world to explore</a>, full of unique locations, quests, and characters, alongside action-packed gameplay. As such, we tried to choose similar titles that could mimic that feel, so there are a few Soulslike in here, like Elden Ring, but it’s important to note that Shadows isn’t Soulslike.</p>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-odyssey">Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you fancy yourself a completionist, you can beat <strong>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</strong> in approximately 140 to 150 hours. If you start now, there’s a chance you’ll finish the entire story and side quests before the launch of Shadows in February. Of course, Steam’s Winter Sale will probably impede your progress.</p>



<p>In any case, the story of Alexios and Kassandra spans Greece, with mythological elements to shake up the chaotic action-oriented combat, stealth segments, horseback riding, and some of the franchise’s best exploration. You can lose yourself in Odyssey’s game world for much longer than it takes to beat the story mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring">Elden Ring</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I have spent many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-beat-elden-ring-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of hours</a> exploring The Lands Between, and I’m still in Limgrave (not really!). Some players spend thousands of hours in the game. With the recent expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, you could play the latest Soulslike from developer From Software for months without fear of running out of new dungeons to delve into or bosses to shed a tear over.</p>



<p>The sheer build variety, open-world exploration, and borderline addicting combat make for a memorable experience that draws you back month after month.</p>



<p>If you intend to hop into the expansion, know that it’s exceptionally challenging, first and foremost. Secondly, we have a guide to help you with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC’s boss order</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-2">Nioh 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Koei Tecmo</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you were excited to play Assassin’s Creed Shadows due to its Japanese setting, then Nioh 2 provides a similar world to lose yourself in, albeit one with far more yokai. The Soulslike, which combines elements of your favorite ARPGs, such as Diablo VI, proves to be one of the genre’s most satisfying yet niche titles. It’s a loot goblin’s heaven!</p>



<p>That said, it’s also the roughest recommendation I can offer. It’s a bit jank, a little complex where it doesn’t need to be, and relatively niche. But if you’re a fan of its setting, style, and challenging gameplay, you’ll find an RPG worth playing for hundreds of hours in the meantime!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins release date confirmed – watch 23 minutes of gameplay]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-%E2%80%93-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay.994863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has officially announced a release date for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>. The upcoming reboot, which does away with the series’ traditional numbering, will transport players back to ancient China next year on January 17th, 2025.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher has also granted fans an in-depth look at Dynasty Warriors: Origins during TGS 2024, uploading a 23-minute gameplay preview with producer Tomohiko Sho that shows off a slew of exciting new features. You can watch in full here:</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - TGS2024 Gameplay Footage" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yGIXY0AWFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A quick glimpse at Origins and you’ll realise that this isn’t some grand departure from the well-established Musou game template. “1 vs. 1,000” hack and slash combat is still very much the beating heart though developer Omega Force is looking to refresh its ageing battle system with some welcome tweaks and additions.</p>
<p>Battles strive for more of a cinematic feel, giving players more defensive and strategic options in between bouts of frenzied button bashing. As Origins’ nameless protagonist, you’ll be able to put ally grunts to use, activating tactical abilities to give you the upper hand.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll still spend most of your time cleaving through entire ranks of enemy soldiers, watching their lifeless rag-doll bodies flung across the screen. In doing so you’ll earn Bravery that can then be spent on unleashing Arts – special moves that change depending on which weapon you have equipped.</p>
<p>One change we’re particularly looking forward to is the increased threat from enemy officers. In Dynasty Warriors: Origins they’re looking more fearful, coated in a powerful aura that needs to be whittled down before you can finish them off. Some engagements will trigger duels that prompt all nearby troops to form an impromptu arena around the player and their opponent. The introduction of a parry move should also add a much-needed defensive layer to the Musou combat.</p>
<p>The last mainline game in Koei’s flagship franchise didn’t fare so well. 2018’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9</a> was meant to mark a radical change in direction that abandoned the conventional mission-based structure for a sprawling open world design. While it had some interesting ideas, the overall execution was poor and neglected a core part of Dynasty Warriors in need of improvement: its combat.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</p>

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPbmb?object_uuid=1f93be51-736c-40e2-8606-6790c3773696&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition</a> has just recently been released with a launch price of $209.99 and you can only get it at Best Buy. That is $10 more than the cost of a standard Switch Lite, justified by the fact that a 12-month Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership – which normally retails for $49 – is bundled with the console.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition (Best Buy Exclusive)</h2><div id="203239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition Is Now Available</h3></p><div><p>Includes 12-month Switch Online membership + Expansion Pass</p></div></div><p>The Switch Lite Hyrule Edition was announced during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced">June 18 Nintendo Direct</a> alongside the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. We originally saw it available <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-where-to-preorder-uk">overseas in the UK</a>, but Best Buy has exclusive rights here. </p><p>This particular edition is adorned in a gold colorway very similar to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-limited-edition-oled-nintendo-switch">Switch OLED Hyrule Edition</a>. It is a gorgeous metallic finish that looks even better than in the photos. Aside from the tiny Triforce logo, the front of the case is free from any busy embellishments. The rear sports a single large embossed Hyrule Crest. It's the best-looking Switch Lite so far.</p><h3>Differences between the Switch Lite, Switch, and Switch OLED</h3><p>The Switch Lite's major draw is that it's $100 less expensive than the Switch and $150 less than the Switch OLED. It's compatible with most Nintendo Switch games and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. </p><p>The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite are that: 1) the controllers are not detachable, 2) the console can't be docked and played on a TV, and 3) the display is smaller (5.5" vs 6.2" on Switch and 7" on Switch OLED). </p><p>If you were intending to use the Switch solely as a handheld console, you might be better off just getting the Switch Lite. Even though the controls aren't detachable, the Switch Lite does support wireless Bluetooth, so you can always purchase another pair of Joy-Cons, a Switch Pro controller, or a compatible third-party wireless Switch controller.</p><h3>What does the Switch Online membership offer?</h3><p>For many people, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Switch Online</a> is a necessary add-on for a complete Switch experience.

<p>Valve Corporation, tired of paying arbitration fees, has removed a mandatory arbitration clause from Steam's subscriber agreement. Valve told gamers in yesterday's update that they must sue the company in order to resolve disputes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement">subscriber agreement</a> includes "changes to how disputes and claims between you and Valve are resolved," Steam wrote in an email to users. "The updated dispute resolution provisions are in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#10">Section 10</a> and require all claims and disputes to proceed in court and not in arbitration. We've also removed the class action waiver and cost and fee-shifting provisions."</p>
<p>The Steam agreement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240807021027/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#10">previously said</a> that "you and Valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration." Now, it says that any claims "shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Steam's email to users said the updated terms "will become effective immediately when you agree to it, including when you make most purchases, fund your Steam wallet, or otherwise accept it. Otherwise, the updated Steam Subscriber Agreement will become effective on November 1, 2024, unless you delete or discontinue use of your Steam account before then." Steam also pushed a <a href="https://x.com/401authrequired/status/1839501542770057414">pop-up message to gamers</a> asking them to agree to the new terms.</p>
<p>One likely factor in Valve's decision to abandon arbitration is mentioned in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.337957/gov.uscourts.wawd.337957.1.0.pdf">pending class-action lawsuit</a> over game prices that was filed last month in US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The Steam users who filed the suit previously "mounted a sustained and ultimately successful challenge to the enforceability of Valve's arbitration provision," their lawsuit said. "Specifically, the named Plaintiffs won binding decisions from arbitrators rendering Valve's arbitration provision unenforceable for both lack of notice and because it impermissibly seeks to bar public injunctive relief."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Mandatory arbitration clauses are generally seen as bad for consumers, who are deprived of the ability to seek compensation through individual or class-action lawsuits. But many Steam users were able to easily get money from Valve through arbitration, according to law firms that filed the arbitration cases over allegedly inflated game prices.</p>
<h2>Valve sued lawyers behind arbitration claims</h2>
<p>Valve used to prefer arbitration because few consumers brought claims and the process kept the company's legal costs low. But in October 2023, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826.1.3.pdf">Valve sued a law firm</a> in an attempt to stop it from submitting loads of arbitration claims on behalf of gamers.</p>
<p>Valve's suit complained that "unscrupulous lawyers" at law firm Zaiger, LLC presented a plan to a potential funder "to recruit 75,000 clients and threaten Valve with arbitration on behalf of those clients, thus exposing Valve to potentially millions of dollars of arbitration fees alone: 75,000 potential arbitrations times $3,000 in fees per arbitration is <em><strong>two hundred and twenty-five million dollars</strong></em>."</p>
<p>Valve said that Zaiger's "extortive plan" was to "offer a settlement slightly less than the [arbitration] charge—$2,900 per claim or so—attempting to induce a quick resolution."</p>
<p>"Zaiger targeted Valve and Steam users for its scheme precisely because the arbitration clause in the SSA [Steam Subscriber Agreement] is 'favorable' to Steam users in that Valve agrees to pay the fees and costs associated with arbitration," Valve said.</p>
<p>Zaiger has a "Steam Claims" <a href="https://www.steamclaims.com/">website</a> that says, "Tens of thousands of Steam users have engaged Zaiger LLC to hold Steam's owner, Valve, accountable for inflated prices of PC games." The website said that through arbitration, "many consumers get compensation offers without doing anything beyond completing the initial form." Another law firm called Mason LLP used a <a href="https://www.masonllp.com/case/valve-mass-arbitration/">similar strategy</a> to help gamers bring arbitration claims against Steam.</p>
<p>There hadn't previously been many arbitration cases against Steam, Valve's lawsuit against Zaiger said. "In the five years before Zaiger began threatening Valve, 2017 to 2022, there were only two instances where Valve and a Steam user could not resolve that user's issue before proceeding to arbitration. Both of those arbitrations were resolved in Valve's favor, and Valve paid all of the arbitrator fees and costs for both Valve and the impacted Steam user," Valve said.</p>
<p>Valve's lawsuit against Zaiger was dismissed without prejudice on August 20, 2024. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826.29.0.pdf">ruling</a> in US District Court for the Western District of Washington said the case was dismissed because the court lacks jurisdiction over Zaiger.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Jumping into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> match is always a surreal experience, because any round of the battle royale juggernaut might include Lando Calrissian, Spider-Man, Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock from the movie Venom, RoboCop, Ellen Ripley from the 1979 horror film Alien, the Joker, wrestler John Cena, and pop star Lady Gaga. And those are just the skins my friends and I use.</p><p dir="ltr">In this way, Fortnite is as close to the online world imagined in Ready Player One as we have in real life. There's definitely something hilarious in watching Deadpool, Alien's Xenomorph, Geralt from The Witcher games, and Will Smith as Mike Lowrey from Bad Boys dance to NSYNC together. There's goofy, childish fun in random characters being mixed up and doing stupid things like forming a rock band or riding a cartoon train in between bouts of gunning each other down. It might be an incredibly one-note joke, but it's one that doesn't seem to get old.</p><p dir="ltr">But playing Fortnite always feels kind of gross for the same reason. It's a mosh pit of business interests--not a celebration of characters and stories so much as the gotta-catch-em-all collecting of Intellectual Property. As corporations come to own more and more media of all sorts, we see more and more of that Ready Player One blender of nonsensical appearances of various bits of pop culture, devoid of any real soul. Fortnite is a major offender but far from the only one. You can be Nikki Minaj and shoot Paul Atreides from Dune in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty</a>. You can beat on Bugs Bunny as Batman in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/multiversus/" data-ref-id="5000-543744">MultiVersus</a>. You can ride a Ghostbusters-inspired speeder bike in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375245-fortnitelocker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375245" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375245-fortnitelocker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375245"></a><figcaption>Do you not love IP?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375245-fortnitelocker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In all these cases, people and characters pop up in one game or another, but they don't add anything for their presence. Having Fry and Leela in Fortnite doesn't bring the spirit or creativity of Futurama into Fortnite; it just lets you purchase a few references from the show you like to see in the game you like. They're all stripped of meaning and stamped out as if from an assembly line.</p><p dir="ltr">Funny, then, that a game based on Funko Pop toys, which literally exist to squeeze characters from various properties into a single, easily reproducible form that can be stamped out on an assembly line, gives the strongest sense of the uniqueness this era of IP obsession could be good for, but isn't.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/funko-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-569178">Funko Fusion</a> is a third-person action game in which you play through a bunch of levels inspired by different IPs, not too different from something like the various Lego games licensing properties such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, and The Incredibles. Though I'm not really a fan of Funkos generally (although I admit to owning several--but <em>mine </em>are the <em>cool</em> ones, like the wendigo from Hannibal, BT-7472 from Titanfall 2, and a voxel Xenomorph from Alien), I found myself really wanting to like the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/funko-fusion-review-pop-til-you-drop/1900-6418292/" data-ref-id="1900-6418292">despite it getting frustrating to play at times</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">What I find endearing about Funko Fusion, despite the fact that it too is in the business of smashing various properties together, is that Funko Fusion is weird.</p><p dir="ltr">Funko has seven major levels based on IP from Universal movies and TV shows, and only some of those feel normal to be in a video game, like Jurassic World, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and Masters of the Universe. But several are interesting, unexpected pulls: Edgar Wright's '90s action movie send-up-slash-homage, Hot Fuzz; the Netflix series The Umbrella Academy; the TV series Battlestar Galactica from 1978; and John Carpenter's horror classic, The Thing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375194-funkofusionnope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375194" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375194-funkofusionnope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375194"></a><figcaption>I gotta say, I never expected any sort of video game adaptation of the movie Nope.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375194-funkofusionnope.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are also a bunch of secret levels and characters you can uncover, referencing all kinds of stuff. You can race against KITT, the talking car from the 1980s David Hasselhoff TV series Knight Rider; you can fight alongside Xena from Xena: Warrior Princess, Lucy Lawless's 1990s action show that spun off from Hercules: The Legendary Journeys; you can get attacked by serial killer-possessed doll Chucky from Child's Play and by M3GAN, the killer-robot doll from the eponymous movie. There are full levels based on Jaws, Shaun of the Dead, Jordan Peele's Nope, and the 1999 version of The Mummy. If you find enough collectibles, you can even unlock a playable Colonel Sanders--the guy from the fried chicken fast-food restaurant.</p><p dir="ltr">Funko Fusion represents a smattering of strange choices for things to bring into a video game, and for the most part, it renders them in pretty expansive detail. The Mummy level is full of puzzles and traps, culminating in a boss fight with Arnold Vosloo's fly-breathing version of the monster. There's a whole Back to the Future scene in Hill Valley where you have to put new tires on the DeLorean.</p><p dir="ltr">All this to say that it's the fact that Funko Fusion taps into IP that nobody is really tapping that intrigues me. It makes me nostalgic for another time: the 1990s, at the height of the Console Wars, during the fourth generation of gaming hardware. It was a time before corporations realized they could just jam a character from one thing into another thing, which would thus act as an ad for both, but would require little creativity.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the time of the tie-in video game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375211-topgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375211-topgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375211"></a><figcaption>I never once managed to land on the air craft carrier in Top Gun on the Nintendo Entertainment System.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375211-topgun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you weren't alive or playing games during the 1990s, you might not really understand what I'm getting at. Tie-in games still exist, of course: There are those Lego games, Ubisoft put out a game adaptations of Star Wars this year and Avatar last year, and in 2023 I played games I really enjoyed based on movies I love--Aliens: Dark Descent, RoboCop: Rogue City, and Starship Troopers: Extermination. The Harry Potter people are currently trying to convince us that Quidditch is cool with a game tie-in. Movies and TV shows still get video games made about them.</p><p dir="ltr">But especially in the '90s and even into the early aughts, when it was much easier to make a game based on anything that seemed like it might remotely draw interest from kids, <em>everything</em> had a video game. There were games based on everything from Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd and Cliffhanger to Addams Family Values, Hook, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Casper, The Flintstones, Home Alone, Home Improvement--even the Robin Williams movie Toys and the Noid, a weird little guy they used to put in Domino's Pizza ads. Read through the Wikipedia list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_based_on_films#:~:text=Atari%20Games.%20Mindscape%20%5B29%5D%20Tengen.%20Indiana" rel="nofollow ">games based on movies</a> sometime, because the old ones get pretty wild.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, most of these were absolutely cynical cash-grabs, and many felt like it. But occasionally you'd get something like Enter the Matrix, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, Disney's Aladdin and The Lion King, Blade Runner, Cool Spot (featuring the mascot for 7-Up)--or GoldenEye. Most tie-in games were just platformers or Doom clones, coming off as low-effort and low-interest by the people who were making them. But sometimes, you could get something really exciting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375195-ghostbustersnes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375195" data-ratio="0.56181818181818" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375195-ghostbustersnes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375195"></a><figcaption>I still have my copy of Ghostbusters for NES and that game suuuucks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375195-ghostbustersnes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The thing is, the fact that Funko Fusion has an entire level based on the movie Nope is just cool for the execution, because the time when you could find such a wide range of movies and TV shows rendered as games has long since passed. Sure, Galactica's Cylons or Nicholas Angel from Hot Fuzz could make their way into Fortnite, but they'd just be weird versions of the characters made to do TikTok dances. Their value begins and ends at "Hey, I recognize that."</p><p dir="ltr">What I hope for Funko Fusion is that it might lead to more games like it--more projects tapping ignored licenses and actually delving into their stories, characters, and worlds, at least a little. I want more RoboCop: Rogue Citys, more Starship Troopers: Exterminations, more Aliens: The Dark Descents. I want more doofus adaptations of barely family-friendly comedies and Robin Williams movies nobody liked. I want something more than $10 skins that remind me of things I previously enjoyed.</p><p dir="ltr">If we're stuck living in a world where all media is corporate IP anyway, we should at least get some weird games out of it.</p>

I often fall into long stretches where I pick up and play a lot of games for varying periods of time, but never finish them. Thanks to the job, I just rarely have the time to linger on a thing for too long outside of a professional obligation. Fortunately, the last few games I’ve picked up have been just the right size, allowing me to see them through to the end and marvel at their construction and ingenuity. I’m now more convinced than ever that we need shorter games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,192610,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On the most basic level, shorter games just <em>feel</em> better. Or rather, <em>I</em> feel better at their conclusion. Games aren’t just experiences to be had, but also things to be beaten. Finishing a game is supposed to be a triumph, and it can often be that victorious feeling that carries me from one to the next. Even if a title lacks any real story, we have our own narrative arcs with them, complete with rising and falling actions, climaxes, and a conclusion, and that’s a satisfying rhythm to have with a game. Your impression of a movie, book, show, or album is colored by the time you spend with it and how thorough an experience it is. Therefore, it’s kind of incomplete if you never listen to that last song, or see the final shot of a film. Similarly, games that I don’t finish remain this kind of half-formed image in my head. Since most notable releases have ballooned in size and now require dozens of hours to complete—time which, in my life, is increasingly hard to come by—I’m finishing less and less of them, but there are now more barely formed impressions of them in my head than ever. You know what that all means? It means I’m playing less than ever before, and experiencing fewer fresh titles as a consequence, and it’s as frustrating as it sounds.<br></p><p>The run I’ve been on the last few weeks flies in the face of the industry’s poorly conceived notion that bigger is unilaterally better. It started when I was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">reviewing <em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, a 3D platformer that thankfully takes all of about a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-astro-bot-guide-1851642040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-astro-bot-guide-1851642040">dozen or so hours to beat</a></span> and see through to 100 percent completion. Soon after that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/plucky-squire-review-zelda-pc-playstation-xbox-switch-1851648226&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/plucky-squire-review-zelda-pc-playstation-xbox-switch-1851648226"><em>The Plucky Squire</em></a></span><em> </em>was released, and I managed to beat that roughly 10-hour game across two back-to-back evenings. When I couldn’t sleep the other night, I booted up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a></span> and wrapped it within about three hours.</p><p>Even looking ahead at some of the games I’m excited to get to, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269"><em>Arranger</em></a></span><em> </em>sounds like a fantastic game that I can wrap up in a weekend and <em>Castaway </em>explicitly communicates how much of a bite-sized adventure it is. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308"><em>I Am Your Beast</em></a></span><em> </em>is a speedrunning first-person shooter styled like a comic book that is a few hours long, and <em>Arco </em>seems about as lengthy as most of the aforementioned titles. Look at what a wealth of different experiences I could potentially get around to without having to exhaustively give up whole days of my time.</p><p>I’m not just propping these games up due to their lengths, either. Each of the games that I’ve beaten over the last few weeks stands apart from the others, and they all feel like breaths of fresh air. <em>Astro Bot </em>is the feel-good, polished AAA 3D platformer that people have begged for, the kind that it seemed like only Nintendo and Sega were in the business of making anymore. <em>The Plucky Squire </em>is a loving homage to gaming’s past that’s perhaps <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126">a little <em>too</em> hands-on</a></span> with its guidance but frequently hops between genres and dimensions and sets you loose in its best moments. <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>sometimes feels more like a series of interactive comedy sketches stitched together than it does a fully-featured game, but it is also one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever played, and unlike anything I’ve picked up before it.</p><p>All three games feel like things that could only be made by smaller teams with clear visions that were unburdened by the industry’s tendency to fruitlessly chase trends. They eschew the previously outlined parameters of success, and yet I’d consider each one of them a resounding win. Crucially, none of them ever get stale or stagnant due to the premium bloat that is so commonly found in the lengthy blockbuster games often touted as the culture’s best work.</p><p>By comparison, many criticisms of a tentpole game like <em>God of War Ragnarök </em>found the game to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/god-of-war-ragnarok-cast-too-big&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/god-of-war-ragnarok-cast-too-big" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarkably, even distractingly, stuffed</a></span>. <em>Persona 5</em> felt like such a slog by the end that I had to shelf it for a month mere hours before its ending. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed both <em>The Witcher 3 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but eventually found myself dashing to the credits and forgoing the near-endless side content that either aimed to distract me with. This year’s <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-remake-mini-games-third-game-1851272221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-remake-mini-games-third-game-1851272221">bigger than it realistically should’ve been</a></span>, and its best moments are undermined by the inconsistent quality of its filler content, which is so frequently pushed to the forefront. There <em>is </em>such a thing as bang for your buck, but a lengthier experience with a game is not always a richer one. These games exhausted me, and their increasingly standardized framework feels like a prison for games and their developers. Only so many things can get made with such a specific and narrow vision before we start reproducing the same shit ad nauseam and it all risks becoming nothing more than slop. </p><p>The previously mentioned blockbusters are each great in their own right, but they are also all victims of the AAA inflation that leads to problems like scope creep, blown up timelines, rising budgets, and increased pressure from publishers and business partners to meet increasingly unrealistic expectations that promise returns from their huge investments. The idea that games need to be this big is a scam sold by marketers and executives who want to upsell you the same kinds of games over and over. These are the same people who birthed games-as-a-service to turn one-time purchases or installs into “forever” games squeezing you for your money for months, if not years, at a time. The same people who tried to trick you all into thinking they believed in <em>Concord </em>and then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">pulled it from physical and digital shelves within weeks</a></span>. These titles are victims of a failing system and vision for games.<br></p><p><em>Astro Bot, The Plucky Squire</em>, and <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, as well as other shorter games, aren’t the catch-all antidote to the industry’s ailments, but they sure do read like a damn fine blueprint for a possible future. There’s no good reason why these sensibly budgeted, mid-range, and creative titles should feel like outliers in this field. Even the safest of them, <em>Astro Bot</em>, feels like this bold experiment when it really shouldn’t. A family-centric platformer and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602">adorable brand icon</a></span> is a no-brainer on so many levels, but after a decade of pursuing prestige and mature audiences with increasingly bloated games and overly similar franchises, Sony breaking from its own tired formula reads as revolutionary when it’s just common sense.</p><p>I don’t want massive games to disappear. Sometimes, you need a three-hour epic of a film to rock your world and sensibilities, or a hefty tome of a novel to challenge you. I don’t know of a good double-album, but I’m sure there’s one out there that provides a sonic journey like no other, and similarly, there are worlds and stories in games that demand a certain size and investment to pay off. I just wrapped up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899"><em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span><em> </em>after more than 80 hours, and I’ve been championing it as one of the best things I’ve ever played. I <em>just</em> want us to break free of the trap that the homogenized vision of the big game has become.</p><p>That’s why we <em>need </em>shorter games. Yeah, I selfishly feel better being able to complete these diverse, brilliant, and bite-sized experiences, but it also feels like a healthier move for everyone involved. It frees developers to make a different mold of game than what the industry has deemed acceptable for the last decade. Hell, it could begin to <em>save </em>the industry from the ballooning costs and increasingly common failures of the service games bubble that has clearly burst. It’s something else, and more than ever, that’s what video games need.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror titles Detention and Devotion, has announced its equally well-received Sekiro-inspired action-platfomer Nine Sols is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 26th November.
</p>
<p>
Nine Sols, which released on PC back in May following a successful crowdfunding campaign, casts players as the cat-like Yi, as he embarks on a quest of vengeance through a dark fantasy world, melding sci-fi and Eastern mythology. His goal is to eliminate the realm's formidable rulers - the nine Sols of the title - and unravel the mysteries of an alien race.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, Nine Sols combines elements of a Metroidvania - insofar as it features a vast interconnected world, albeit one you'll largely be exploring in a linear fashion - and what Red Candle calls fast, brutal "Sekiro-lite" combat build around slashes and deflections. Oh, and it's also a lovely looking, gorgeously animated thing too.

<p>
Nine Sols (which I absolutely adored during my limited time with it earlier this year, and which has also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/">amassed an Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> on Steam if you're looking for a broader canvassing of opinion) will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch when it launches on 26th November.
</p>
<p>
And if you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate  subscriber, you might like to know Nine Sols is joining the service's game catalogue at the same time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-jacob-geller-ubisoft-assassins-creed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video essays are one of the few places you can go on YouTube to get substantial, well-researched commentary on a subject, as opposed to sensationalized yelling with a thumbnail where somebody looks like they just saw the face of God. But those video lengths sure do tend to balloon, don’t they? What’s going on there? One might be tempted to chalk it up to the YouTube algorithm, but this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a> guest, video essayist <a href="https://jacobgeller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Geller</a>, has a different take.</p><p>Geller joins us ahead of his 24-hour stream to raise money for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which you can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jacobgeller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tune into here</a>. We discuss video game criticism in the age of drive-by culture wars on social media and conclude that – despite how bleak things might seem – there’s a growing hunger for meaningful criticism. We also learn about the ins and outs of creating heady essays on YouTube, specifically: Why do they keep getting longer? How do you write for a specific audience without becoming somebody who pre-reacts to every bad faith YouTube comment?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to this week’s big news: Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/456349/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-star-wars-outlaws-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying the new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em></a><em> </em>following weaker-than-expected sales of its<em> Star Wars</em> game. Amid all that, as well as an ongoing campaign against <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for featuring a Black samurai</a>, Ubisoft also decided to issue a statement about how its goal is “<a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1838973833014895088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to push any specific agenda</a>.” Grimacing emoji. Lastly, Christmas comes early for me and me alone, because the mailbag is chock full of questions about <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goku</a> and karaoke.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make the longest video essay yet: one that never truly ends.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Jacob:</strong> I think if you go back and watch my early videos, the sound quality sucks and the editing is worse, but they’re not very different from what I’m doing now. They’re pretty close. Something that seems to happen to every video essayist is, videos just get longer. It’s something I keep thinking about, because anyone who’s been doing this for a long time, if you look at the trajectory of their videos, they get longer. And I don’t think it is simply to do with YouTube rewarding longer videos. I think that is the case, and people have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Rogers’ six-hour [<em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>] video</a> getting a million views and have thought “I can do that.”&nbsp;</p><p>But I have never tried to do that. I have never thought “This video isn’t long enough for the algorithm; it needs to be longer.” And yet, the average span of my videos just has crept upwards over the years. And I think part of it is, at least for me, [that] having a larger audience makes me feel more on the hook for “I need to do due diligence about this.” I now read, in general, multiple books per essay. And the more you take in, the more you have to say on any subject.</p><p>I read – I have here – this book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Torture-Democracy-Darius-Rejali/dp/0691143331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Torture and Democracy</em> by Darius Rejali</a>. The worst month of my partner’s life was when I was reading this torture book and was like “Guess what I just read about!” She’d be like “Please don’t tell me.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>David Grossman, my beautiful husband that I love so much, he has this really interesting biography of Hitler that’s that size. He was reading it around when the war [in Gaza] started, and he put it on our coffee table. And every time we had people over, I’d be like “Baby, you’ve gotta move the giant Hitler book with Hitler’s face on it.”</p><p><strong>Jacob: </strong>Shaking his head the whole time…</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> So people know he doesn’t approve of the ideas.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He’s like “OK, what you’re saying is, I can’t have it on the coffee table, so I should take it on the subway and shake my head the whole time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jacob:</strong> My guess is that if he was writing an essay about Hitler before he read the book versus after, the after would be way longer because he would be like “Even if I’m still condensing down information, I still have a thousand more pages to condense down.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, you have that urge to be comprehensive. I struggle with this sometimes too, when I’ve reported out a big story and talked to a lot of people. When you become really intimately familiar with a subject, then it can feel, if you really condense it down – or if you omit a lot of information – like you’re somehow failing the people who are consuming your work and yourself and, if you talked to people, the people that you spoke to. How do you balance that with “There’s got to be a cutoff point to this. I can’t just put everything in here.” Where do you draw the line?</p><p><strong>Jacob: </strong>I think it’s easier with art than with journalism. I have talked to classes before and people who write about video games, and my advice is always: Do not tell me about a whole game – especially if your job is not just writing a review. Pick one interesting thing about a game and see how far you can go with that one interesting thing. Make it as small as you possibly can; get specific and dig in. That is such a better way of finding what a game is doing than being like “The graphics are good, and then the audio I don’t like as much. And then the gameplay,” etc. It’s too much.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the reasons that my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eirR4FHY2YY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video on capital punishment</a> is specifically on execution methods and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPiL3-CYzWk&amp;t=363s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video on torture</a> is specifically about <em>Call of Duty</em> torture scenes is an attempt to narrow the scope of those things. To be like “Can I make the framing of this small enough that then there are specific things I can talk about, but people will know this is not the definitive take on torture?” It’s just everything you could say about<em> Call of Duty</em> torture. Well, not everything – not even. A tenth of the things you could say about <em>Call of Duty</em> torture.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it’s really kind of being rigorous with yourself about “The thesis of this video cannot be ‘Everything you need to know about torture.’” What are the things you’re using to support it, and thus, what are your pieces of evidence that are most relevant to those things – and not just everything that could possibly be interesting about this?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That’s very, very real. Scope is the most important thing about criticism, I think, because you cannot possibly answer everyone’s question in the entire world. You just can’t. You only have your perspective that you can rely on. You can only speak from yourself. If you remember that, then it becomes easier to pare something down to the most essential parts, because you understand your own fallibility. We are all influenced by the things that have come before us and the society in which we live.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Coconut, coconut, coconut!</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It’s a fucking coconut meme, right? But it’s true! I would not be the writer I am if my dad’s favorite class in college was not Anarchist Thought. There is a certain culture I was born into that shows me what my limitations are, what perspectives are native to me. It is difficult for me to think outside of that. So once you accept that you can’t please everyone, you can write something that is actually useful.</p><p><strong>Jacob: </strong>It is the YouTuber brain disease – and you can just see it happen in real time – of people forcing themselves to write into their scripts the objections that they can see coming from reading thousands and thousands of comments. And I can’t fault anyone for doing that because the human mind is not meant to read YouTube comments. If you’re going to read everyone take every sentence of what you’ve written in the worst-faith way possible, then you are consciously or not going to start adjusting your writing style to please the worst-faith readings of your work.&nbsp;</p><p>It just makes the writing broken, because for every claim you’re making, you have to say three things that are not the claim you’re making, and you have to make clear that you’re not saying those things. It really breaks up the flow of an argument. But I understand why people do it! I have that impulse too. I think “If I say this, people are going to think I’m saying that, so I have to make clear that I’m not.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pilot-quest-ufo-50-addictive-zelda-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started playing <em>UFO 50</em>, a game collection of 50 games meant to simulate a lost 8-bit game library, I felt I vaguely knew what I was in for. I assumed, wrongly, that it would simply be a series of retro throwback games that slowly unveiled themselves, that I would get addicted to a handful of them and call it a day. I did not reckon with game #44: <em>Pilot Quest Return to Zoldath</em>, which is brilliant and now consumes my every waking hour.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome back to Zoldath. Credit: Mossmouth.</figcaption></figure><p><em>UFO 50</em>’s fictional games are presented in chronological order, and <em>Pilot Quest </em>is far down the timeline. Having played the first six games, I decided to have my dessert first and picked it at random. In it, you play a little spaceman who has crash landed his ship on a planet and must repair his ship. You awaken in the middle of an alien town equipped with a yo-yo. In the middle of the town is a moon crystal that you can hit for moon shards. Moon shards are the game’s first level currency. Get enough shards and you can buy seeds from the Gumma Tree. Those seeds will ambiently produce shards in the background, turning the game into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cookie Clicker</em></a>-style game. In addition to this, you exchange shards for meat that slowly accumulates at the hunter’s lodge. Those slabs of meat can be given to the guard at the exit of town, who will let you out into the The Wild Zone, and that’s where the game gets interesting.</p><figure><figcaption>You gotta pay my man Slard if you wanna enter The Wild Zone. Credit: Mossmouth</figcaption></figure><p>When I saw that <em>Pilot Quest</em> was an incremental game I was initially annoyed, because many of those games are simply skinner boxes that infinitely dose out rewards with seemingly no end or point. But the overworld element to <em>Pilot Quest</em> is implemented brilliantly. Each slab of meat adds to the time that you can spend outside, but it also acts as your health. If you want to take anything back to the town, you need to make it back alive. Take a few hits and you may run out of time. This means that the more time you risk out in the The Wild Zone, the more you gamble. As you get the parts of your ship back, you start to gain not just shards but also resources like ingots or science that can be harvested by fixing buildings in your town for your friends to live in and work on. In effect it is <em>Farmville </em>mixed with a meta town builder like&nbsp; <em>ActRaiser&nbsp;</em>or <em>Soul Blazer </em>mixed with <em>Zelda</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>You need to strengthen your base in order to survive longer in order to strengthen your base. Credit: Mossmouth</figcaption></figure><p>What makes this game truly brilliant within the context of the collection is that, in the lore of<em> UFO 50</em>, <em>Pilot Quest </em>was the first game on the console to utilize the clock feature. This means that the game continues to collect resources as long as you are playing <em>UFO 50</em>. Like many incremental games, babysitting it yields diminishing returns. The game’s structure rewards you playing a little bit of it, quitting, playing a different game, and coming back later.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption> The history description of the game lets you know that the game actually mines resources while you're not actively playing it. Credit: Mossmouth</figcaption></figure><p>Despite being kind of mad at how addictive <em>Pilot Quest</em> is, it is<em> </em>one of the few incremental games that I respect. What it is doing in its place in the collection makes me want to play the other games more while constantly checking in ambiently between rounds of other games. I’m also glad that I played it early, and I would suggest you do too, because I am gaining more progress in it than if I had played it chronologically. It is a brilliant take on the form</p><p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some resources to farm.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/uk-class-lawsuit-against-sony-set-to-go-to-trial-in-march-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been officially confirmed that the class <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-to-face-7-9-billion-mass-lawsuit-due-to-playstation-store-pricing/">lawsuit against Sony</a> in the UK is set to go to trial on 2 March 2026. It's estimated that the trial will last for eight weeks in total. For those unaware of what this trial is about, Sony is being sued for the unlawful behavior of charging out-of-proportion prices on their digital content, including add-ons. This lawsuit has been created by Alex Neill, a person with nearly 20 years' worth of experience in consumer campaigns and trying to achieve change for UK consumers. Alex is a regular speaker at industry events regarding consumer issues and consumer rights across all sectors in the UK. She is the sole director of Alex Neill Class Representative, which is a not-for-profit special purpose vehicle that is being used for the specific purpose of pursuing claims against Sony.</p>
<p>While the trial may seem far away, Alex explains that the trial dates have been set considering the amount of time it takes each of the parties to share evidence and expert reports and prepare their cases. The court's availability also plays a role.</p>
<p><a href="https://playstationyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This case</a> is based on the claim of those who owned a Sony PlayStation between 19 August 2016 and 19 August 2022 and those who did own one, purchased digital PlayStation games, or made in-game purchases via the PlayStation store. This class lawsuit is going ahead as the claimant believes that PlayStation is occupying a dominant position in relation to the digital distribution of PlayStation games and in-game content and, as such, has been charging UK customers too much for the content on their consoles. While Sony is entitled to make a profit with their products, the claimant is alleging that they are in breach of UK/EU competition law, as they have a "near monopoly" on the sale of digital games.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sony has enforced strict terms and conditions on game developers and publishers, which allows Sony to set the price of digital games and charge a 30% commission on every purchase of digital games and in-game content. This leads to excessive and unfair prices for consumers. By having such high prices, the Class is alleging that customers have been paying too much, which has led to detrimental effects for consumers, including stifling competition, where the competition has to charge higher prices even to get an opportunity to compete.</p>
<p>With this class lawsuit, anyone can sign up as long as they are eligible. If the Class is successful in its lawsuit, it means that those who signed up may receive some compensation from Sony.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/apocalypse-unleashed-marvel-crisis-protocol-figure-and-terrain-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>En Sabah Nur, known more commonly as Apocalypse, has finally made his chilling debut in <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>. As one of the most powerful and ancient mutants in Marvel Comics, Apocalypse has been a bane to the X-Men for decades. Now, <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em> players can bring this iconic villain to their tabletop battles. Atomic Mass Games sent along a review copy of Apocalypse, as well as several terrain sets tied to the character, for review - so follow along to hear my thoughts!</p>
<h2>Apocalypse Character Pack</h2>
<p>Let's start with the star of this show, Apocalypse. Also known as En Sabah Nur, he's been a long-time antagonist to the X-Men, with the goal of pushing the world to evolve through extreme crises! And though <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/collections/crisis-protocol/products/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Apocalypse character pack</a> is the second most expensive single-character pack for the game at USD $69.99 (second only to <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/collections/crisis-protocol/products/marvel-crisis-protocol-dormammu">the $79.95 Dormammu miniature</a>), there's a lot of content in this little box o' Apocalypse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-high-gloss-image.jpg?itok=AOMxjac- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-high-gloss-image.jpg?itok=_6NFJCX- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First, we should look at his stats and abilities, and I'll go over how I think he can best be used in a game of <em>MCP</em>. After that, I'll speak a bit to list creation with him, and how his specific list restrictions open up some really fun options for building a Four Horseman team!</p>
<p>First, his stats across the board are pretty strong - which you'd expect from one of Marvel's biggest baddies! With 4's in all his defense stats, and 7 HP, he's very sturdy. Add to that his special ability "Only The Strong Remain," which is always removing 1 Damage every time he's hurt, and you're looking at a very, very tough customer here. But here's another interesting aspect to this character: he's a size 4. That means that most things you throw at him (or throw him into) aren't going to hurt him much.</p>
<p>This, thematically, makes a lot of sense to me! It's hard to imagine Peter Parker doing much damage to Apocalypse by flinging a telephone pole at the guy, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For attacks, Apocalypse uses his ability to transform his body into weapons (the model kit comes with a few alternative build options for his arms, giving him saws or guns. I kept it classic, as I'm want to do in all my miniatures). This ability is shown in the Biomorphic Arsenal attack, his builder with a whopping 7 strength.</p>
<p>En Sabah Nur's Judgment, his second attack which keys nicely with his You Will Be Remade Through Me special ability, really wants you to be inflicting condition types on your opponents. But talk about someone who can dish out condition effects but can't take them - Apocalypse is immune to all conditions when you flip him over to his injured side. I can't think of any other model for the game that can do the same.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apocalypse-healthy-and-injured-cards.jpg?itok=HYVq4oI0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apocalypse-healthy-and-injured-cards.jpg?itok=4hrxNIK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So, how do you play Apocalypse? A lot of that comes down to really using him as the leader of the Servants of the Apocalypse affiliation. But just straight up as a 6 Threat miniature on the board, I could see him being very useful at eliminating threats and targeting your opponent's priority models. He doesn't have very good range, but get him in close and let him pummel your enemies, and you should be in good shape.</p>
<p>Now what's all this about his affiliation: Servants of the Apocalypse? This is, by far, the best way to utilize Apocalypse in your games of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. With this Affiliation, you'll assign Apocalypse the 'Master of the Horseman' card.</p>
<p>But who are the horsemen? When building a roster of 10 potential figures to bring to a match, you'll want to make sure those ten models are eligible to one of Apocalypse's Four Horseman. Atomic Mass Games has a handy chart to consult:</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/servants-of-the-apocalypse.jpeg?itok=EW_M7Ni3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/servants-of-the-apocalypse.jpeg?itok=Xg6bZLXB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When building your roster based on the Threat Level of the encounter, you'll squeeze as many horsemen from your roster in as possible, and each will be assigned their relevant card for whether they play the role of Death, Famine, Pestilence, or War.</p>
<p>Each of these cards offers useful - but not game-breaking - boosts, from dishing out damage to draining energy from nearby characters, and they all work towards helping Apocalypse evolve into more. And Apocalypse gains the powers of every horseman card on the field.</p>
<p>There are untold synergies here between the innate abilities of the characters you can use as your four horsemen, Apocalypse's ability to serve as a storage bank of energy for characters and fun interactions on the board. I have a feeling this could end up being very competitive, with lots of different iterations on the most potent combo of characters and abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/four-horseman-cards-marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse.jpg?itok=SA8pyRKE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/four-horseman-cards-marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse.jpg?itok=aHqTVTA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All of this is why, as I stated above, I think there's a lot of game packed into a single character pack, and bringing Apocalypse to the table opens up a lot of new play options for the inventive MCP player. But now let's talk about the new terrain sets that are coming out alongside Apocalypse (but sold separately).</p>
<h2>Dark Future Terrain Pack</h2>
<p>The Dark Future Terrain Pack starts our trend of bringing Apocalypse-adjacent terrain into&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. Featuring an overall look that combines Ancient Egyptian construction and style with futuristic Celestial Technology, Dark Future is the first of three exciting new Terrain Packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-future-terrain-pack-glossy.jpg?itok=SKy3VNBc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-future-terrain-pack-glossy.jpg?itok=RXa67fWJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This pack features 2 Regeneration Vat Miniatures, 2 Energy Syphon Miniatures, 4 Sacred Flame Miniatures, 4 Illuminated Crystal Miniatures, and - most importantly - two different One-Shot cards. First, the "Teleportation Network" reduces the overall threat value by -1, and allows players to teleport between Crystal Obelisk (Illuminated Crystal) pieces of terrain by interacting with them (Fun note: nothing in the rules says you can't destroy these obelisks and shut down the teleportation network).</p>
<p>The second One-Shot included in this is "Celestial Healing," which lets a character interact with a regeneration vat to remove 2 damage and 1 special condition at the cost of gaining the stagger special condition. Aside from these fun one-shots - and INCREDIBLE new addition - the miniatures themselves really do a nice job of getting the game away from the classic NYC-style terrain.</p>
<h2>Shrine To En Sabah Nur Terrain Pack</h2>
<p>This terrain pack consists of two small chest miniatures and one large, chunky Shrine To En Sabah Nur (remember, that's Apocalypse's real name) terrain piece. Solid and easy to construct, this model offers great cover and comes with a One-Shot that adds +2 to the Threat of a game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shrine-to-en-sabah-nur-glossy.jpg?itok=Yw4ELDAn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shrine-to-en-sabah-nur-glossy.jpg?itok=8eM5ZxCH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That One-Shot, "Trial of Survival," allows characters overlapping with the miniature to gain a bit of the power of Apocalypse, copying his ability to remove 1 damage every time they take a hit.</p>
<h2>Rejuvenation Chamber Ultimate Encounter</h2>
<p>Finally, there's the absolutely stunning Rejuvenation Chamber Ultimate Encounter. This huge terrain model, which at the time of this writing is still up for pre-order, features a massive Rejuvenation Chamber model. And it comes with a full Ultimate Encounter, "Survival of the Fittest."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rejuvination-chamber-glossy-large.jpeg?itok=XZ9sRb8w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rejuvination-chamber-glossy-large.jpeg?itok=anPL90eV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This Encounter, for three players, sees two players serving as the Crisis Team, each bringing their own squards to battle. The other player takes on the role of Apocalypse (sold separately) and four minions. And while it's a little bit odd that this is for three players exactly (not a normal player count), the game is in desperate need of more multiplayer formats/scenarios!</p>
<p>In the Encounter, Apocalypse hibernates while his minions attempt to grow his power, and after a certain point in the game Apocalypse will emerge, ready to fight! Depending on how well his minions did, he'll enter with one of four different character cards based on his "Evolution Count."</p>
<p>We haven't had a chance to playtest this Ultimate Encounter yet, but reading through the rules it looks like a very fun asymmetrical PvP format, and there's even a sliding difficulty scale!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-miniature-closeup.jpg?itok=O-R8Qjl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-miniature-closeup.jpg?itok=MXC2AjeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Marvel Crisis Protocol </em>Apocalypse Miniature and Terrain - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is an absolutely astounding set of releases all tied around Apocalypse, and it just shows how much care and dedication the team puts into&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. For such an iconic villain as Apocalypse, this is the kind of miniature and release schedule the fans deserve. And though it helps build out the board, you don't have to go all in on the (admittedly pricey) terrain to get the most out of your experience.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of the game and are considering diving into Apocalypse, you'll be pleased to know the character is done justice by its interpolation in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>.</p>
