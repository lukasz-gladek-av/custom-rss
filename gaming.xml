			<p>Almost immediately after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct had players excited about the new device and the new games revealed, a dark cloud took shape above that excitement with Donald Trump's announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">steep tariffs</a> imposed on countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the time since, there's been plenty of speculation as to how these tariffs will impact the cost of the console<span>. Nintendo even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed pre-orders for the console in the United States</a> from the original April 9, 2025 date&nbsp;</span>to "<em>assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>That delay will now also impact Canada, as Nintendo confirmed to Canadian publication <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/">MobileSyrup</a> that pre-orders for the console have been delayed in Canada "<em>in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S.,</em>" the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date,</em>" the statement continued. "<em>The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged</em>."</p>
<p>It's unfortunate news for Canadians who thought they might've avoided the delay that their southern neighbors are dealing with, especially considering that they are only hearing it a day before pre-orders were meant to go live.</p>
<p>The fate of Canadian gamers' Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order hopes is now tied to that of United States gamers, whether they like it or not. In this case, it's safe to assume not.</p>

			<p>The PvPvE extraction RPG game from Wolcen Studio, currently known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">Project Pantheon</a>, just got a new teaser trailer revealed along with the announcement that Wolcen Studio is hosting a second closed alpha test that interested players can now sign up for.</p>
<p>The test will only last for a little less than a day, beginning on <strong>Friday, April 25, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT</strong> and ending the next day on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday, April 26 at 2:59pm PT / 5:59pm ET / 10:59pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Those interested in joining the closed alpha to get an early taste of Project Pantheon can <a href="https://pantheon.firstlook.gg/">sign up for the play test at this link</a>.</p>
<p>If you already participated in the first closed-alpha test for Project Pantheon, you don't have to worry about signing up for this new one. You'll automatically be granted access to it. For everyone else, all you need to do is make sure to register your interest in the play test before <strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>There's a number of new features that play testers will be able to check out, including the player sanctuary now being a "<em>fully 3D navigable hub where players can customize gear, track achievements, and craft runes</em>," the studio says in a press release.</p>
<p>There's also a new dodge roll mechanic, new weapon and gear customizations, new weapons like a new magic weapon simply called "<em>The Staff</em>," new dungeons, a new monster faction to fight in t<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">he Hamförir, and a structured gameplay tutorial to help newcomers get the hang of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Of course, there's also a slew of bug fixes<span>&nbsp;and new quality-of-life improvements. For example, a revamped health and shield system, abilities adjusted to feel&nbsp;<em>"snappier,</em>" according to Wolcen Studio, and the overall movement system </span>improved.</p>
<p>If you miss out on this closed alpha, Wolcen Studio currently has two more planned for Project Pantheon after this. The third closed alpha test will arrive sometime in summer 2025, with the fourth coming a bit later in the year in autumn.</p>

You know, I'm going to be very real with you right now: I thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-rumble">Sonic Rumble</a> was already out. It feels like I've been hearing about this thing for an eon now, probably because it was leaked a good while before Sega even officially revealed it. And yet here we are, with an announcement from the house of hog (sorry) saying that in actual fact, it's not out until May 8th, exactly a month from now! Perhaps this is a sign that I'm losing track of time, perhaps this is a game that Sega has been cooking in the kitchen for a bit too long. Who's to say!
</p>

<p>
This one's obviously a lot more geared towards kids that say to their parents "can you put Sonic on your phone" given that it'll be available on iOS and Android, but even though it does appear to be skipping out on a console release, it is coming to PC via Steam.

The skins-inclined amongst you - I appreciate this is the worst possible way to put this - might be interested to know that <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3Ddb045d06-e0f8-4d7d-8de3-69c167c330d2">the more wishlists there are</a>, the more goodies you get when the game arrives, like a movie Sonic skin, who honestly looks a bit terrifying.
</p>
<p>
I'm not easily won over by free-to-play games all that much, though I do think the kind of toy vibe Sonic Rumble has is cute. It looks like it's being quite smart about how it folds in that general Sonic feel to its more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque levels too. Seriously though, I like movie Sonic's design, but there's something not right about the Sonic Rumble skin…

<p>When asked about the sequel in a recent interview, the director of ‘A Minecraft Movie’ stated, “It seems like there’s already talk about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-director-would-have-a-blast-making-the-sequel-nbsp">A Minecraft Movie Director Would Have a ‘Blast’ Making the Sequel &nbsp;</h2>

Hess stated that the team enjoyed creating this movie; however, the game world is so expansive that “there were so many things” they couldn’t tap into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hess added that he “would have a blast doing the sequel” for the Minecraft movie before stating that he is excited because “it seems like there’s already talk about it happening.” The director added that it would be a lot of fun to dive back into this world, and the audience is also seemingly going ”wild” for their post-credits scene, which hints towards a potential sequel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hess already has a plan for the characters he will focus on in the sequel. <strong>Spoilers Ahead</strong> for those who haven’t watched the movie, as this references the post-credits scene.</p>



<p>In the post-credits scene of A Minecraft Movie, they teased Alex, an iconic character from the game’s universe. Hess has stated that “it’s Steve (Black) and Alex, and so that’s the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt” for the sequel.</p>

<p>The road to Room 46 is reached through one of several gaming platforms. Two of them are the PlayStation and Xbox, and we’re here today to let you know if Blue Prince’s journey can be explored as part of an Xbox Game Pass or PS Plus subscription.</p>



<p>Blue Prince is a game that wasn’t known by many at one point, but loved by those who did. It topped many early GOTY lists, and now that reviews are in, its Metacritic score is cause for some serious eyebrow raising.

                <p>One of the developers behind the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has clarified that the indie Metroidvania will launch on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 when it finally does come out.</p><p>Because we've waited so long for this game and most recently saw it in a Switch 2 presentation, that can make one wonder if Hollow Knight: Silksong is now a Switch 2 exclusive. "Just to clarify...Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming to both Nintendo Switch AND the Nintendo Switch 2," Matthew Griffin, a member of Team Cherry's marketing and publishing team, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1909395467945099502" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained on X</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv0f8mYemL4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rv0f8mYemL4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is infamous due to the long gap between its announcement and release. Developer Team Cherry first revealed the sequel to Hollow Knight at E3 2019 and even showed off extended gameplay during a Nintendo livestream. The game then disappeared for years before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-day-one/1100-6504333/" data-ref-id="1100-6504333">reappearing at Microsoft's 2022 Xbox Games Showcase</a>, where it was teased that it'd be out within the year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed/1100-6513963/" data-ref-id="1100-6513963">That didn't end up happening</a>.</p><p>We did not see Hollow Knight: Silksong in action again until April's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, when it briefly appeared in a third-party sizzle reel with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-releasing-this-year-according-to-nintendo-switch-2-direct/1100-6530562/" data-ref-id="1100-6530562">2025 release window</a>. That all seems to suggest that we'll finally get our hands on Hollow Knight: Silksong this year, and Nintendo system owners will be able to pick which version of it they want to play.</p><p>Thankfully, Hollow Knight: Silksong won't be a console exclusive. It is currently slated to be released sometime later this year on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo consoles.</p>

In hindsight, it was absurd to think I could plant myself in the middle of the CWA booth for a modest chat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My interview quickly morphed into a passionate roundtable with around seven workers, most of whom had simply clocked the fact I was here for a press interview and leapt at the chance to share their story. As more folks squeezed themselves around what I suspect might have been the smallest table in San Francisco, it became apparent just how ferociously passionate CWA union members feel about an industry that rarely seems to reciprocate that affection.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/epic-buys-ai-powered-3d-asset-tagging-technology-loci" target="_self" data-discover="true">Epic acquires AI-powered 3D asset tagging technology Loci</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We still have a lot of energy in us to help our industry be better than it is," says Brian Ostrander, a software engineer and CODE-CWA member, when asked about the motivations behind launching UVW-CWA. "We're excited about leveling up the organizing capacity at the conference over the last couple of days to get them on our level and get them fighting the boss as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">UVW organizing committee member, Kaitlin 'KB' Bonfiglio, explains unions are ultimately movements about "worker protagonism." The appeal of UVW-CWA is that you simply pay your dues to receive your membership, but that's merely the first step on a larger journey towards seizing control of your own fate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is a moment by and for all of us," says KB. "We've been answering a lot of questions such as 'what do I get by joining?' This movement is just beginning. If you think of IATSE and SAG-AFTRA—those unions have been around for hundreds of years. So if you think of this as the beginning of an industry-wide movement, you get to decide and vote on what we do and how our funds are used."</span></p><p>CWA union members begin a rally in Moscone West at GDC 2025 / Image via Game Developer</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right now, UVW-CWA is focused on protecting workers from the encroachment of generative AI and the corporate sledgehammer of mass layoffs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're wondering just how prevalent the latter issue has become, one organizing committee member explains that, during their founding meeting, every single person in the room had either been impacted directly by layoffs or knew someone who had.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/unity-promises-to-deliver-battle-tested-switch-2-support" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity promises to deliver 'battle-tested' Switch 2 support</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The emotion [in that room] was so palpable," they explain. "The sadness. The anger. The compassion. It's very clear that's the galvanizing issue. Everything else kind of flowed downstream from it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those sat around me believe fighting back means convincing others that collective power can overwhelm even the largest corporation—who they feel have grown far too accustomed to exploiting a workforce that has accepted a false status quo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real point of this movement is to engage people and to get them to understand that we have way more power than any corporation will ever have," says Yao. "These are issues that are deeply rooted in human dignity and self respect, and we are told so often to put that all aside for your career. I believe that is a false dichotomy. You can have both and you should have both. We are trying to teach people that you deserve both."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a sense within the group that corporate leaders across the industry view video games as shimmering golden goose. That might go some way to explaining the growing disconnect between the developers pouring their hearts and souls into their work and those cutting their paychecks.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-ll-be-showing-them-just-how-valuable-our-labor-is-zenimax-workers-vote-to-authorize-strike-at-microsoft" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Microsoft claims it has made 'fair' proposals to union workers after Zenimax staff authorize strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The C-suite, at least in my experience, are not from the industry," explains Ray, a unionized worker at Sega of America. "They don't have a background in gaming. They often come from different industries, but they see the video game industry as this huge cash grab."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It a sentiment that others around the table share. Ostrander notes how studios are frequently bought by private equity and "squeezed for all they're worth"—but also feels there can sometimes be issues at smaller, indie studios, where some bosses might be laboring under the auteur delusion. He reiterates all workers—at every level—make valuable contributions when bringing a project to market. So why are some still struggling to get the recognition they deserve?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want those workers to feel empowered as well—and not to be pushed around by bosses who think they have better taste," he adds.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Union members fear their passion and creativity is being 'crushed and destroyed'">Union members fear their passion and creativity is being 'crushed and destroyed'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fight for recognition and better conditions has also been hampered by union busting. When workers begin to organize, it's not uncommon for employers to undermine their attempts by deploying a litany of well-worn tactics.&nbsp;I'm told the playbook often includes misclassifying people who should be full-time workers as contractors to limit their rights, jettisoning large groups of employees post-launch to halt any organization attempts in their tracks, or siloing remote workers to prevent them from communicating with their colleagues and presenting a united front. It can make the fight harder, but not impossible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One member explains the CWA is now adept at spotting union-busting in action and is more then prepared to push back. The alternative to fighting—at least, for those sat around me—isn't worth thinking about.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can see where [the game industry] is going to go [without unions]," explains Taylor Welling, OneBGS union member and organizer at Bethesda Game Studios. "Replacing employees with AI. Replacing employees with outsourcing. Treating employees poorly. It's really heading towards an unpleasant working experience for workers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yao agrees. "I've already seen where this is heading within the multiple workplaces, where all the passion and creativity that goes into these games is just being crushed and destroyed," he explains. "We are experiencing burnout at an unprecedented rate—and the answer I keep hearing is 'stop caring about what you do.' We don't get into this industry because we don't care about video games. We absolutely care about this art form. So, to tell me the only way I can survive and have a career is to turn that side of my brain off and to stop caring about the art that I'm working on and the people I'm working with—that's impossible."</span></p><p>A digital version of the UVW-CWA informational zine handed out at GDC 2025 / Image via UVW-CWA</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The passion and empathy is palpable. There is also steely resolve and iron-clad determination forged in the fires of an industry that appears to believe its talented workforce is disposable. An asset to be depleted and discarded without mercy. Can unions provide a quick fix? No. This skirmish has been raging for years. In what feels like a battle for the very soul of the industry, it seems they do offer something in abundance: hope.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[I hope unions] can usher in a future where we don't look around and wonder where all of our older mentors have gone. Where we don't look around and wonder where all of the younger interns have gone, because it's an industry that's incompatible with having a family or taking care of a loved one when they're in the hospital," says Ostrander.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[I hope it becomes] an industry that's sustainable.

            <p>
Every now and then I abandon all of my responsibilities and go for a walk in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/book-of-travels">Book Of Travels</a>, a “tiny MMO” from Might And Delight. While a bit Orientalist in ways I’m still unravelling for myself, it’s one of the loveliest video game spaces I’ve ever inhabited: huge, picturebook horizons, molten shades of greenery, tiny wanderers keeping pace with beautifully combed clouds.</p>
<p>Might And Delight’s just-announced “cosy decoration game” Twinkleby doesn’t have quite the same magic, so far – it’s less mysterious, more wholesome. But I do enjoy its focus on antique dollhouses. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
In Twinkleby, you build cutaway houses on floating islands and decorate them with furnishings such as sofas and lamp posts. In the process, you’ll attract vagrant bobble-head people, who will arrive in astral sailboats and make requests you can fulfil for additional rewards. It reminds me of how you'd turn wild creatures into residents in Viva Pinata.</p>
<p>The campaign is a procession of these breezy pastelcore asteroid conversions, with map fragments to discover that unlock hidden islands. You can also collect shooting stars and spend them at a place called Molligan’s Antiques, which I’m hoping will turn out to be a proper vintage toy emporium born of some designer’s extra-curricular obsessions. There are, needless to say, no lose conditions and no game-overs: this is about tricking out dioramas as you please.
</p>
<p>
Every “wholesome” game needs its undercurrent of darkness, especially when the name has you picturing some kind of gerbil butler. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> has the concept of a mortgage; Twinkleby has the option of throwing everything and everybody away like a spoilt child. Just lob anything you're displeased with over the side of the island and it'll return to your inventory.</p>
<p>“Expand your collection, discover antique secrets, decorate, and when you change your mind – evict everyone and throw their furniture into space!” sings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362960/Twinkleby/">the Steam page</a>. The jarring choice of "evict" here makes me suspect that Twinkleby is some kind of Molleindustria black op. Perhaps the bobblehead people will eventually form a co-operative and depose you.
</p>
<p>
Look out for Twinkleby sometime in 2025. The only thing I outright dislike about the game so far is the familiar choice of sound effect when you place objects – that delicate "kiss pop" which, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-new-shores-is-the-follow-up-to-2019s-gentlest-town-builder">as I noted in my write-up of Islanders: New Shores</a>, has become ubiquitous in cosy building games, and which I now find repulsive for its dopamine-milking inoffensiveness. 
</p>
<p>
I didn’t know it was possible to feel patronised by a sound effect. It reminds me of those automated doors in The Hitchhiker’s Guide that were made sentient specifically so that they could sigh in satisfaction when you walk through them. We need a next gen of “kiss pop”, cosy game developers. Musical fart noises? The clattering of actual dollhouse furnishings?

                <p>Glover, the 1998 3D platformer starring a glove with four fingers who likes to roll around on a colorful rubber ball, recently received a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DW1MV5X9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new physical edition for Nintendo Switch</a>. Published by Limited Run Games, Glover initially sold out at Amazon when the retailer listed it a couple months back, but it's back in stock now for its normal $35 price.

You’ll roll through 30 levels and six different worlds, each one featuring the same retro graphics as the original game.</p><p>Just like the original, there’s also a bunch of power-ups and weird characters to encounter during your journey. Despite its flaws Glover has become something of a cult classic over the years--so if you’re interested in checking out the Nintendo 64-era 3D. platformer and like to own physical games, snag a copy while you can.</p></div>                      </div><p>Limited Run has noted that Glover is not a numbered release in the Limited Run Games Collection. Instead, the company is distributing Glover for QUbyte Classics. In other words, if you’re an avid collector of Limited Run games, missing out on this won’t ruin your collection.</p><p>Another way to play Glover on a modern console is with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Piko-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0CTKZNC4Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaze Evercade Piko Collection 4</a>. The collection includes 10 games (one of which is Glover) and can be played on Evercade Handheld, Evercade VS-R, Evercade EXP-R, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-alpha-bartop-arcade-review-the-best-and-most-versatile-home-arcade-machine/1100-6527595/" data-ref-id="1100-6527595">Evercade Alpha</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-reveals-two-new-super-pocket-handhelds-featuring-neo-geo-and-data-east-games/1100-6530501/" data-ref-id="1100-6530501">Super Pocket</a>. Beyond Glover, the $24 cartridge includes Street Racer, Risky Woods, Skuljagger, Star X, and more.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade EXP-R</a> is frequently sold out, but it’s available for close to retail price at Amazon ($105, five bucks more than MSRP). Bundled with Tomb Raider, the handheld retro console is a great way to take classic games on the road with you. Alternatively, one of the four Super Pockets is a more affordable companion for Glover. Each one comes preloaded with its own set of games, including hits like Double Dragon, Asteroids, and River City Ransom.</p><h2>Play Glover on Evercade Hardware</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade EXP-R</a> -- $105 (Third-Party Seller)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Retro-Gaming-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VYPWLH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade VS-R</a> -- $125 (Third-Party Seller)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Capcom-Super-Pocket-Atari-2600/dp/B0CB6DTMYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom Super Pocket (12 games built-in)</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Technos-Pocket-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DBLPWDLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos Super Pocket (15 games built-in)</a> -- $56 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Atari-Pocket-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DBLMM94B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari Super Pocket (50 games built-in)</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Taito-Super-Pocket-Atari-2600/dp/B0CB6DG8R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taito Super Pocket (17 games built-in)</a> -- $59</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Alpha-Bartop-Arcade-Atari-7800/dp/B0D5HQZ16W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade Alpha Mega Man Bartop Arcade</a> -- $250</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Alpha-Bartop-Arcade-Atari-7800/dp/B0D5HQQ34B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade Alpha Street Fighter Bartop Arcade</a> -- $250</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-is-first-switch-2-game-you-can-preorder-in-the-us/1100-6530662/">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Is First Switch 2 Game You Can Preorder In The US</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-lego-set-gets-rare-discount-snag-the-ornithopter-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6530648/">Dune Lego Set Gets Rare Discount - Snag The Ornithopter For Its Best Price Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-console-bundle-deals-still-available-at-amazon/1100-6529417/">Astro Bot PS5 Console Bundle Deals Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movie-steelbook-and-exclusive-crafting-table-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6530625/">Minecraft Movie Steelbook And Exclusive Crafting Table Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Delayed Due To Tariffs, Release Date Still June 5</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-here-are-your-options/1100-6530578/">MicroSD Express Cards For Nintendo Switch 2 - Here Are Your Options</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-four-mario-kart-lego-sets-for-the-best-prices-yet-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Grab Four Mario Kart Lego Sets For The Best Prices Yet At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-fans-can-preorder-shadow-labyrinth-secret-edition-for-only-60/1100-6528469/">Pac-Man Fans Can Preorder Shadow Labyrinth Secret Edition For Only $60</a></li>   </ul> </div>

But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/554062/path-of-exile-2-players-bully-elon-musk-during-eerie-airplane-stream">during the stream</a>, he was bombarded by messages from viewers bullying him for his work <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/644186/hands-off-washington-dc-protest-musk-trump-doge">dismantling the US government</a> and his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200141/elon-musk-shivon-zilis-twins-twitter">tumultuous personal life</a>.</p></div><p>The stream, which, as of this writing, <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1mrGmPleodQKy">is still available to view on X</a>, lasted for roughly an hour and 45 minutes, in which Musk himself rarely spoke. He stared silently and solemnly at the camera as he played through the early parts of the game, released in early access back in December. During the stream he died a few times, forcing him to create new characters as he played on hardcore (i.e. perma-death) difficulty. Here’s one of them.</p><p>A few minutes into the stream, Musk started to receive private messages from other players. Some were celebratory, calling him a “god gamer,” but the messages quickly veered into spammy, then abusive territory. One message asked him to “make it clap for daddy.” Another was a player claiming to be Ashley St. Clair, a former partner of Musk’s who is currently <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2025%2F04%2F01%2Felon-musk-ashley-st-clair-paternity-dispute%2F82760786007%2F" rel="sponsored">locked in a custody battle with him</a> for their five-month-old child. While yet more seemingly cut to the heart of Musk’s destructive ego trip with the American government, “Elon, deep down you will always be cringe no matter how much money or power you have.”</p><p>Some viewers tried to be helpful, suggesting that Musk use the command to disable messages, but he took no action. In the last minutes of the stream, Musk made a hardcore difficulty character he named Kekius Maximus, a 4chan-esque meme name he’s used as his display name on X. But Kekius Maximus was not long for the world. Musk died to one of the game’s tutorial bosses due to a bad connection, which subsequently concluded the stream, ending another sad, weird data point in the Elon Musk fake gamer saga.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders are opening up in various regions—not you, United States—today and tomorrow, meaning that, likely, millions of people are set to make the $450+ purchase on the new console. Unfortunately, however, there are plenty of others that won’t be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC</a>, which took place prior to the console’s pre-orders being delayed in the United States, Nintendo of America’s president Doug Bowser was asked about the console’s price and what players who can’t afford it should do. His response? Play the original Switch.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Addresses Nintendo Switch 2 Game Prices</a></h6>



<p>“As we look at Nintendo Switch 2 and you think about the feature sets that I talked about … we believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall,” Bowser said.</p>



<p>“We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford [the Switch 2’s] price point. That’s why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so [people] still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.”</p>



<p>While it’s not as direct as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_JVVUnCWnY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Don Mattrick’s response regarding</a> the Xbox One requiring a constant internet connection in 2013, it still isn’t something that’s likely to sit well with a lot of players. </p>
