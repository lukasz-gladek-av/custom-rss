<p>The "core visual identity" has been preserved</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It's a huge week for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> series with the arrival of the latest entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. For Switch 2 owners, this is one of the first <em>major</em> third-party releases to hit the platform alongside other versions, so how does it hold up? The talented team at Digital Foundry has now taken a look at the port for Nintendo's hybrid platform, and overall, Capcom has done a respectable job here, even if there are some shortcomings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Capcom has preserved the core visual identity of the game, delivered a pretty convincing mobile version and leveraged the hardware's not-so-secret weapon - DLSS - to make this conversion defy the console's necessarily limited specs. The missing piece is frame-rate discipline, something we'd hope to see Capcom look into with a future patch."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the specifics, Switch 2's resolution has been "slashed" to 540p in docked, but Nvidia's upscaler puts the image quality ahead of the Xbox Series S version. The UI is also fixed at 1080p on Switch 2. As for handheld mode, the game renders at "just 360p" but DLSS once again saves the day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On paper, a 540p image blown up to 1080p on a modern flat panel display doesn't sound great. However, DLSS (likely the full CNN-based variant, comparable to PC) looks surprisingly competitive...The handheld story is even more extreme, but somehow a 4x resolution upscale from 360p to 720p (likely with a basic upscale to the screen's 1080p) still manages to look fine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the performance front, the Switch 2 runs at an unlocked frame rate across both modes and targets 60fps. It doesn't hit this target "a lot of the time" but mostly runs in the 40s and 50s docked, with the lowest dips reducing the game to 30fps. In handheld, you can expect the game to "knock off a few frames in comparable spots".</p>

<p>As part of the Switch 2 experience, there are some minor cutbacks from a visual standpoint, but they apparently don't impact the run of play. Geometry is pared back, there are lower-quality textures, and Capcom has taken a different approach to character hair on Switch 2. Variable performance could also "use some work".</p>
<p>On the plus side, the level loading times are "very quick", and reloading a save is also relatively quick. For a more comprehensive rundown, be sure to check out Digital Foundry's full review.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The trailer for <em>We Are So Cooked</em>, a nice, cozy co-op physics stealth game about trying to hide a dead body with your friends, dropped today <a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/2018088867174203808">after the game went viral for its premise</a> earlier this month.&nbsp; The trailer does a good job of highlighting the particular challenges of trying to stealthily remove a dead body from a busy hotel, from abundant security cameras to the body’s floppiness. The game, which comes from indie developers Dwarven Brothers, premiered its trailer on <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2027075581406220756">Geoff Keighley’s X account</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DVOtmTwDOF5/">The Game Awards Instagram</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We Are So Cooked.</p> <p>First trailer for new indie co-op physics stealth game. </p> <p>You’ve accidentally killed someone, and now you have to get rid of the evidence. <a href="https://t.co/G34FieuScm">pic.twitter.com/G34FieuScm</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2027075581406220756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Though the game is technically playable solo, individual players will face extra challenges. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4258290/We_Are_So_Cooked/"><em>We Are So Cooked</em>‘s Steam page</a>, “dragging the body alone is slow and leaves a bloody trail,” and “You can hold an item, OR you can drag the body. You can’t do both. You’ll have to scream at your friends to open doors for you.” Co-op play doesn’t guarantee an easier path to victory, though: you’ll have to dodge security guards, dogs, and other hotel guests while trying to navigate down stairs and around corners with an awkward, heavy dead body that seems determined to slip out of your hands. You’ll have to come up with a solid plan and work together carefully to avoid dropping the body—the description warns that “if you pull left and your friend pulls right, you’re going to drop him down the stairs.”</p>

 <p><em>We Are So Cooked</em>‘s lighthearted approach to manslaughter is a nice respite from co-op games with heavier themes, like Hazelight Studios’ fun-looking but actually harrowingly grim divorce game <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-the-best-co-op-game-of-the-year-is-comin-1847973764"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>. At least you and your fellow players are on the same page in this one. <em>We Are So Cooked&nbsp;</em>is set to release sometime in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On September 8, Ash Ketchum’s final <em>Pokémon </em>episodes will premiere on Netflix. After 25 years and over 1,200 episodes, the anime has retired its long-time protagonist and is moving on to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-trailer-liko-roy-ash-pikachu-sprigatito-1850184012">new main characters Liko and Roy</a> as they embark on a journey throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> world. Depending on who you ask, this is either a bittersweet end of an era, or a necessity for the <em>Pokémon </em>TV show to move in new, exciting directions. But regardless of whether or not you think Ash and his quest to be a <em>Pokémon</em> Master should have been kicked to the curb years ago, a pillar of nearly every fan’s <em>Pokémon </em>journey is coming to an end.</p> <p><em>This story was originally published on September 5, 2023.</em></p> <p>For me, Ash was, and largely still is the quintessential anime protagonist from my childhood, beating out characters like Yugi from <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! </em>or Goku from <em>Dragon Ball </em>as the most formative character of my early years. His relationship with his partner Pikachu has embodied friendship and informed my internalized role-playing with my own Pokémon in every single game. But even so, my connection to <em>Pokémon </em>has changed over the years, and my viewership of the anime Ash starred waxed and waned.</p>

 <p>Even if I hadn’t watched the show in a bit, I, like many other fans, felt a great sense of pride for the kid from Pallet Town after he became a Pokémon world champion at the end of his final season. But that also probably meant his time was limited. Shortly after, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-and-pikachu-new-season-liko-roy-1849903499">confirmed it would be leaving him behind</a>. Even those of us who’ve fallen off the show often still view Ash as central to our own <em>Pokémon </em>journeys, and for a long time, it felt like he would be a fixture for every <em>Pokémon </em>fan, no matter when they started watching the anime.</p>  <h2><strong>For long-time fans, Ash’s departure is the end of an era</strong></h2> <p>“I felt unexpectedly emotional when I heard that Ash was finally being retired,” Keza MacDonald of <em>The Guardian</em> (previously of <em>Kotaku</em>) told me. “He seemed like one of those perennial characters, an ageless fixture. If my kids get into <em>Pokémon</em>—and I’ve shown them a few old episodes of the anime, we’ll see how it goes—they’ll be growing up with different aspirational trainers.”</p>

 <p>MacDonald echoed a sentiment I felt as a child. When I was growing up adults often talked down to us for loving <em>Pokémon.</em> What they didn’t realize was that it was a power fantasy for kids who felt trapped and beholden to their parents’ rules, and yearned to embark on their own journeys alongside their friends and determine who they wanted to be on their own terms.</p>

 <p>“There was an emotional core to <em>Pokémon</em> in the early days that’s still there,” she said. “To adults, it looked like this hyper-commercialized, manufactured phenomenon, designed to sell toys and lunchboxes, but to kids it meant something. Actually, <em>Pokémon</em> is a classic children’s story and Ash is a classic children’s character: the child out on their own, in a world where adults don’t get to call the shots, forming their own relationships and forging their own way.”</p> <div>  <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p>Even as Ash and Pikachu haven’t aged in their decades-long run, <em>Pokémon </em>fans have, and that means a lot of people grow out of the show at some point. As such, you can probably reasonably tell how old someone is by asking them what their favorite scenes from the series are. If you talk to a millennial, they’ll probably mention episodes like when Ash released his beloved Butterfree so it could stay with a pink-colored mate. That still sticks, because it was devastating for us as children. Hell, even going back and watching it as an adult, that shit hurts so good. Ash’s story revolves around perseverance, determination, and connection, but equally deals with letting go, facing loss, and picking each other off the ground.</p>

  <p>“I think the moment that sticks with me the most is at the end of the Indigo League arc, when he loses,” writer Sam Greszes told <em>Kotaku</em>. “I was a kid when I saw that, but I understood what kid shows looked like. And though <em>Pokémon</em> is by no means the first, only, or even best anime to do this, for me, watching that episode was my first experience watching a protagonist fail at his overarching goal. […] It felt nice. Made me think about what you achieve, learn, and discover along your way to a goal, and how making connections can help you through crushing failures.”</p> <p>Younger fans often see Ash as a cool adventurer who gets to go on all these incredible journeys around the <em>Pokémon </em>world, or you might view him as an overly optimistic kid with no real flaws, but for adult fans like streamer Josh Vasquez, his selfless optimism and heroics have taken on new, greater meaning. In the <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>season, there’s an episode called “Lumiose City Pursuit!” in which Ash and Pikachu are trying to subdue an enraged Garchomp, and in the struggle, the little yellow guy is knocked off the Lumiose Tower (think <em>Pokémon</em>’s equivalent of the Eiffel Tower in Paris), and Ash jumps from this height to save his friend.</p> <p>“[There was] no hesitation,” Vasquez said. “He is of course saved but when he jumped, he didn’t know he would be. He jumped to save his friend thinking he would likely die. Ash has done things like that before but I think at the time being a little older it really hit. I was living on my own and moved to a new state and was still getting used to being away from friends and family. So I think seeing that show of love and friendship really hit home for me in the moment.”</p>

 <p>This gradual, rediscovered appreciation for Ash is a trend among adult fans I’ve spoken with since The Pokémon Company announced the protagonist’s departure.</p>  <p><em>Pokémon </em>is a “kid’s first anime” that serves as a gateway into more complex stories within the medium, and that tends to result in a backlash toward Ash as a protagonist. He’s an easy character to sum up, best known for his enthusiasm and tenacity, so as we transition from an equally optimistic child into a jaded adult, Ash can feel like a boring, flat character. But part of growing up is learning that relentless positivity is often more bold or interesting than nihilism, so we may also experience a “softening” toward the character as we grow older.</p>

 <p>“In my later teens and college, I found the character trite, but as I’ve grown into adulthood, I’ve come to appreciate how pure the character is even more than ever, I think,” Greszes said. “There’s something to be said for someone who has one goal and wants to achieve it his way, through friendship and connection. It’s his one reason for being. One singular guiding star, one that never goes out. A purpose. We should all be so lucky.”</p> <h2><strong>Can Ash Ketchum stand tall alongside his anime protagonist contemporaries?</strong></h2> <p>But where does Ash stand in the grander pantheon of anime protagonists? When a character has been around for over 25 years and 1000-odd episodes there’s such a deep well of story to draw from and talk about, which is why anime fandom is an entire subcategory of the <em>Pokémon </em>community distinct from the video games, trading card game, or its <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-original-stitch-sitting-cuties-merch-center-1850507835">lifestyle-brand merchandise</a>. That gives creators like Tom Speelman and Tyler Gorman plenty of fodder for their long-running podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gotta-recap-emall/id1476705429" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gotta Recap ‘Em All</em></a>. After watching the early episodes and movies, Speelman disputes a lot of the criticisms that claim Ash is a less-than-compelling anime protagonist. On the contrary, he thinks Ash’s empathy and determination make him a great character, rather than just a symbol of <em>Pokémon</em>’s larger ideals of friendship and determination.</p> <p>“[He’s] far from the single-minded blank POV character many wrongly remember him as from hazy childhood memories,” Speelman told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Ash really is an amazing anime protagonist. Over and over again, even at the comparatively early stage our show is on, he sets himself apart from nearly every other Pokémon trainer by being empathetic, kind, and understanding toward people and Pokémon. […] Ash may be more devoted to battling than common sense, but it’s his compassion and determination that made him a hero to, well, generations of fans. Now that he’s ridden off into the sunset, it’s truly remarkable just how far he’s come.”</p>

 <p>Part of that dismissive attitude toward Ash as a protagonist can come from not watching the show for several years and misremembering the details. Sometimes when adults rewatch those episodes they find a deeper, more emotionally mature character than history gives credit for.</p> <p>“Watching the anime again and podcasting with my co-host Tom have given me a huge new respect for [Ash],” Gorman said. “Seeing him openly cry in moments of sadness and joy rather than trying to hide it has been one of my favorite details I’ve picked up on.”</p>  <p>Because Ash has been at the forefront of the franchise for as long as he has and has seen so many different sides of the <em>Pokémon </em>world, the character has moved through different stakes, drama, and even writing styles over the years. Those early seasons showed Ash as the determined, empathic, and brave hero he has always been, but amid a slightly edgier tone than more modern anime seasons have. There was a sass to the writing of Ash that lent earlier seasons a more all-ages humor that kept the anime fresh for even aging fans. Nowadays, Ash still has his feisty moments, but the cutting sarcasm and comedic timing have fallen off as the franchise has ironed out some of the hero’s characterization.</p> <p>A lot of those rougher edges have been more apparent in the <em>Pokémon </em>movies, which underwent a reboot of the continuity separate from the anime starting with 2017’s <em>Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!</em> (the one in which Pikachu <a href="https://kotaku.com/perhaps-the-most-surprising-thing-about-the-new-pokemon-1796974292">speaks a whole-ass sentence to his trainer</a>). Broadly, even as the weekly anime has become more of a slice-of-life show, the films Ash has starred in have depicted some of his closer scrapes with death, which probably explains why they made the movies’ timeline diverge and gave Ash new friends to meet and battles to face. But even before this, Ash was shown to be a character malleable enough to go from low-stakes 23-minute episodes to 90-minute epics in which he and Pikachu fought gods. As a protagonist, one of his greatest traits is that he believably exists in so many sides of this expansive world, but does the criticism that he’s just not that deep linger? Perhaps.</p>

  <p>“Ash Ketchum, with all his personality and boneheadedness, is about as standard of a shonen protagonist as you can get,” Greszes said. “He’s fueled by friendship, competition, and one single solitary brain cell, on a quest to Become The Best, Like No One Ever Was. It’s Deku, it’s Soma, it’s Luffy, it’s Ichigo, it’s a standard framework that was pretty rigid even in 1996. The thing that makes Ash special is the meaning we all found in him between the lines.”</p> <p>To fans like podcaster Luke Herr, Ash and the <em>Pokémon </em>anime’s necessity to facilitate a larger franchise has kept him stagnant over the years, which some believe has become more apparent as the anime’s gone on.</p>

 <p>“I’d give him a trophy for having a long career but a lot of the run time was kind of cookie-cutter to keeping the IP going,” Herr told <em>Kotaku</em>. “[This] is admittedly a little unfair, since it is a show for kids, but he didn’t need to change or evolve, as much as even like Gon from <em>HunterXHunter</em>—who changes more and is around a similar age—or Gohan [from <em>Dragon Ball</em>]. Like he did a great job at his job, but it didn’t require that much.”</p> <p>Vasquez, meanwhile, argues Ash has earned a spot in the conversation of great anime protagonists, at least. As much as some would claim he is an airheaded professional athlete with a cute mascot character on his shoulder, his arc—going from a bullheaded kid aspiring to some vague idea of being a Pokémon Master to someone who realizes that the connections he’s made were the real goal—is well-realized.</p>

 <p>“I don’t think he’s associated as much with the likes of say Naruto or Goku, but I believe the mark of a great anime protagonist is earned strength,” he said. “Not just through dedication and training but also strength of relationships and emotional maturity. Even the theme song went from wanting to be ‘the very best like no one ever was’ to ‘I’ll go anywhere if I’m with you’ in the final season. It doesn’t have to be all about the win. Ash learns that gradually through his journey. That’s what makes him the best to me.”</p> <p>That is the realization Ash finds <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-pikachu-final-episode-synopsis-1850261580">in his final episode</a>. After being asked by his original rival Gary if his championship win against Leon has brought him closer to being a Pokémon Master, Ash determines that the title isn’t what made him a Pokémon Master. No amount of training, gym badges, or trophies makes you a Pokémon Master, it’s about being friends with every critter you meet. Whether that be a Pikachu you got from your hometown professor, or meeting actual <em>Pokémon </em>god Arceus and helping him out.</p> <h2><strong>As Ash rides into the sunset, </strong><em><strong>Pokémon </strong></em><strong>has a new path to follow</strong></h2> <p>The conflicting feelings on Ash’s departure speak to a general conflicting feeling around him within the community. For over 25 years, the <em>Pokémon </em>anime followed the same hero who had the same goals. Greszes makes the comparison to the Greek mythological figure Sisyphus, who is forced to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity. Ash has been trying to reach the goal of being a Pokémon Master for all this time, and the need to keep him aspiring to the same things kept him in a “loop of failure.” Allowing him to win a championship and do something else frees him from this never-ending quest, but also gives the show a new place to go by seeking out new stories like Liko and Roy’s.</p> <p>“Ash Ketchum literally spent decades getting that boulder up the hill,” Greszes said. “This was, ostensibly, a way to make the character more interesting and extend his arc, but was also a way to enable his growth, enable him to pursue other adventures and other goals in pursuit of a goal that stood tantalizingly out of reach. And recently, after decades of adventures alongside friends and rivals, he got that boulder up the hill. There’s nothing left to do now.”</p>

  <p>When I <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947">interviewed Sarah Natochenny</a>, the voice of Ash since 2006, shortly after it was announced Ash would be walking into the sunset, she talked about how her journey as an actor has had parallels with Ash’s journey to become a Pokémon Master. For fans, myself included, Ash symbolizes learning about who you are in a world that feels vast and unknowable at a young age, and that the journey to learn about this world is best taken together. I don’t know many people who watched Ash’s story unfold in its entirety, but every <em>Pokémon </em>fan I know has taken that spirit with them as they’ve embarked on their own journeys. It is sad that the series is losing that universal constant that transcends age and time, but in its place, perhaps the <em>Pokémon </em>anime will find new stories to tell. Hopefully what Ash represented will stay with the series, even as he and his Pikachu walk into the sunset on a journey we’ll no longer follow.</p> <p>“I really hope that emotional core of <em>Pokémon</em> that Ash represented endures: empathy, determination and bravery,” MacDonald said.</p>

<h2 id="h-it-s-all-about-the-tricks-of-the-trade-in-mlb-the-show-26">It’s All About the Tricks of the Trade in MLB The Show 26</h2>



<p>This year, Sony San Diego is heavily promoting the brand new Trade Hub, which they’re calling a one-stop shop for all the deals players will make as Franchise general managers. The logic across all trades has been updated. Players will have access to a more complex system that takes into account several factors, including season standings, market size, rivalries, and more. They’ve also incorporated secondary positions into roster decisions. The hope is that this will lead to the most realistic GM experience yet.</p>

              <p>Well, folks, it seems like billionaire nepo baby David Ellison is probably going to get his way after all. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-paramount-trump-bidding-war-2000651372">throwing a hissy fit</a> because Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">sell its company to Netflix</a> instead of the Ellison-owned Paramount Skydance, Ellison launched a months-long campaign, including a hostile takeover bid that appealed directly to WBD shareholders, to get the company to reconsider.</p> <p>Netflix decided to put an end to Ellison’s aggressive posturing by allowing Paramount Skydance to submit a best and final offer for WBD earlier this month—and WBD’s board has now found that new offer to be a “company superior offer.” Netflix had four days to respond and raise their bid, but, in a surprise move just hours after Paramount’s superior offer news broke, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-declines-to-raise-offer-for-warner-bros-1236738005/">Netflix declined to raise its bid</a> and dropped out of the running. This has left the door wide open for a Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. Discovery merger.</p>

 <p>Paramount Skydance’s new offer of $31 per share for WBD’s entire portfolio, including its cable channels, puts the deal at roughly $111 billion. Netflix had offered $27 a share for only Warner Bros.’ film studio and HBO Max, a deal worth approximately $83 billion. In a press statement, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said, “…this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p> <p>The Netflix deal was also facing increased regulatory scrutiny from a group of <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-warner-bros-deal-bad-for-america-attorneys-general-1236735795/">Trump-aligned attorneys general</a>.&nbsp; A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. Discovery merger will likely have an easier path to approval, thanks to the Ellison family’s close ties to the Trump administration. Ellison’s apparent willingness to cave to Trump’s outrageous demands, as demonstrated by a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">$16 million lawsuit settlement</a> Paramount paid out to Trump, is a deeply troubling sign about the integrity of the person who will soon own Batman, among many other culturally significant properties. Read Netflix’s full statement below.</p>

 <p><em>Netflix, Inc. today announced that it has declined to raise its offer for Warner Bros. Netflix had earlier received notice from Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) that its Board of Directors has determined Paramount Skydance’s (PSKY) latest proposal constitutes a “Superior Proposal” under the terms of WBD’s existing merger agreement with Netflix. Netflix issued the following statement in response from co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters:</em></p>

 <p><em>The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.</em></p> <p><em>Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.</em></p>

 <p><em>Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program.</em></p> <p><em>We will continue to do what we’ve done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/paramount/" id="2941">Paramount </a>appears to have defeated Netflix in the bidding war for Warner Bros. On February 26, Netflix declined to raise its bid for the legendary entertainment studio, leaving Paramount as the frontrunner to purchase WB.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/netflix/" id="1142">Netflix </a>issued an official statement, citing Warner Bros.’s belief that Paramount Skydance’s latest proposal was “superior.” Per The<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-board-warms-to-paramounts-sweetened-bid-new-details-are-revealed-1236514073/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Hollywood Reporter</a>, Paramount’s revised offer includes a cash purchase price of $31.00 per WBD share, a daily ticking fee of $0.25 per quarter starting after September 30, 2026, and a $7 billion regulatory termination fee if the deal doesn’t close due to regulatory issues.</p>



<p>“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid,” read <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netflix-declines-to-raise-offer-for-warner-bros-302699059.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Netflix’s statement.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-netflix-seemed-like-a-lock-to-purchase-warner-bros">Netflix Seemed Like a Lock to Purchase Warner Bros.</h2>



<p>On December 5, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/">Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery reached an agreement v</a>alued at $82.7 billion under which Netflix would acquire Warner Bros.’ streaming and studio assets, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/warner-bros-games/" id="1770">Warner Bros. Games</a>. Meanwhile, Paramount made at least eight unsuccessful offers to buy Warner Bros., and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-sues-warner-bros-over-netflix-deal/">sued Warner in January</a>, but persistence ultimately paid off. </p>







<p>Warner has numerous immensely popular properties, including the DC Comics universe, the Harry Potter franchise, and Game of Thrones.  Now, that’s all seemingly heading to Paramount. Insider Gaming will report any further updates to this story.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, as of today, as temporally upsetting as it is to write this, is officially 10 years old. An entire decade! A far cry from being able to vote, but in the UK it could be convicted of a criminal offence, if such a situation were to arise. And to commemorate such an occasion, creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone shared a 22 minute long video showing some old builds of the game, shared some behind the scenes and tidbits, and revealed the new marriage candidates coming in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming</a> sims' 1.7 update.
</p>
<p>
One is Sandy, a villager who lives out in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/calico">Calico</a> Desert running a store called the Oasis. This is fine! Nothing to complain about here, I rarely think of Sandy when I think of Stardew Valley, but surely there is one person in this world who will be happy to explore such a relationship.In a complete 180 of such a possibility, the other person you can shack up with is Clint. Clint! The same Clint that is universally thought of as a bit of a creepy and most would sooner ignore, if not for the fact that he's the local blacksmith.

<p>
Now, I most certainly will judge you for going through with such a proposal, however, what supersedes this is the fact that out of everyone, this is absolutely the funniest possible choice. A trick and a treat all in one! And that is something I can abide by, even if I can't do the same with Clint himself. 
</p><p>
In any case, while this is arguably the headline, because we're all too deep in the trenches for anything else generally, the full video is worth a watch itself. Barone kicked things off with a look at Sprout Valley, the very first iteration of what we now know as Stardew Valley. It does of course look incredibly different, and yet what strikes is how little mechanically, locatively, and even spiritually changed. The game is there! Just rougher, uglier, perhaps even a bit less confident, but it's there. A neat insight into the development of the reason as to why every other game is a farming sim now.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-duos-matchmaking/</link>
            <guid>1447849</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is the big-time extraction shooter in 2026, looking to knock others off their perch, but the existence (or lack of) Solo, Duo, Trio, and Quad matchmaking could be a big positive or negative.</p>



<p>You could say that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>‘s success could bungie (pun intended), depending on how matchmaking goes. The game is designed with a particular team size in mind, but this might be off-putting to certain players or groups. All will be explained.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-queue-for-duos-in-marathon">Can You Queue For Duos in Marathon?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marathon does not have a Duo queue option, meaning you cannot specifically look and enter a match with just two players—depending on how your matchmaking goes.</strong></p>



<p>In short, the only conceivable way for you and a friend to enter a game of Marathon together is to party up and hope that a third player is not put on your team for whatever reason.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/factions-in-marathon-explained-how-to-unlock-new-factions-increase-rank/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Factions In Marathon, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This isn’t a big surprise, because extraction shooter fans will likely remember that the ever-popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> <em>also</em> didn’t launch with a dedicated Duos matchmaking playlist option.</p>



<p>Duos wasn’t present during the Marathon Server Slam Playtest, so the option will either be made available for launch or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> will add it in after launch as a fresh content option.</p>



<p>One thing’s almost for sure: If you ask for Duos, it will come.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marathon-matchmaking-options-explained">All Marathon Matchmaking Options, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Marathon has two default matchmaking options for you to trigger: Solos and Trios.</strong></p>



<p>If you choose your matchmaking to feature ‘No Fill,’ then no other human players will be added to your squad, and this is essentially <strong>Solos</strong>, without explicitly labeling it as that.</p>



<p>As we’ve established, there is no <strong>Duos </strong>playlist option whatsoever. Marathon’s default squad number is three, and the basis of the gameplay revolves around a three-man squad—so don’t see <strong>Trios </strong>leaving the matchmaking settings ever.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Finally, there is no <strong>Quads</strong> option as you physically cannot have four players in a team. Once again, this <em>might</em> be a thing well after the game’s main launch in March 2026, but there is no Quad setting for the time being.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters all have their own nuances. In this instance, it feels like Marathon is following in ARC Raiders’ launch boots. Does a lack of dedicated Duos or Quads put you off playing? Do you think Bungie will add one or more of these options in the future?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New look, new tools, same core gameplay.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The We Were Here series is the stuff of co-op magic, and at IGN Fan Fest 2026 we got to see its latest evolution. One look at the We Were Here Tomorrow trailer and it's clear the cult co-op series is taking a giant leap into new territory. Previously set in the labyrinthine rooms of an abandoned castle, We Were Here Tomorrow sets its perplexing puzzles in the raygun retrofuturistic looking Norcek facility. The core of the game – shouting at your friend through a walkie talkie as they prove to be dumber than you ever thought possible – remains the same, but there are other changes to go with the new look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a story that has some familiar characters and some totally new ones, and we've also done a lot with giving you new tools for puzzle solving and moving through the environment," said Martín Mittner, creative director at Total Mayhem games. "And we've done a ton of work on the walkie-talkies to keep you in the game instead of on Discord."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Sci-Fi or Fantasy Movie of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you've yet to experience the sometimes chaotic communication of the We Were Here series, there are two key roles: the Explorer and the Librarian. Usually the Explorer is the one faced with physically interacting with the puzzles, while the Librarian translates information only they can see through the walkie talkie that's key to the solution. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What I'm really excited about is accentuating the differences between the two players even more, introducing a bit more asymmetry and giving each player a really unique perspective [and] role in the whole playthrough," added Thijs Schippers, the game's design director. "Yeah, that's in the DNA of this new title, through and through."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both talked about how, as well as giving the designers a chance to work on something other than snowy castles, the change in setting allows for new environments and new setups for puzzles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you've played We Were Here Forever, we did this what we called 'mind-bendy puzzle,' where you're inside a D12 die and you're doing these weird warps between dimensions and getting different information and stuff," said Mittner. "We're doing some more of that, right? There are sort of capstone puzzles that we're presenting that are very mind-bendy. It'll be really interesting to see players play through that. And also there's like a unique aspect to the storytelling we're doing that I can't really talk too in depth about. But it's going to be very different in some ways from previous titles. And it will be interesting to see how the players interact with each other surrounding the story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We Were Here Tomorrow is coming to PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Head over to Steam and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315050/Where_Are_We/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the game to your Wishlist</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just the latest news from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-fan-fest-2026-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">IGN's Fan Fest 2026</a> – check the schedule to see what else is coming and to keep up to date on all the latest from the worlds of games and entertainment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/project-windless-chicken-protagonist-patrik-methe-2000674111</link>
            <guid>1447825</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During a career at Ubisoft that spanned more than a decade, Patrik Méthé worked on series like </span><i><span>Far Cry</span></i><span>,</span><i><span> Rainbow Six</span></i><span>, </span><span>and <em>Splinter Cell</em></span><span>. Now, he’s the creative director on Krafton Montréal’s</span><i><span> Project Windless</span></i><span>,</span><span> an upcoming action RPG in which you play as a big, beefy rooster. </span><span>If you’ve read the Korean fantasy novel series that </span><i><span>Project Windless </span></i><span>is adapting, Lee Youngdo’s <i>The Bird That Drinks Tears</i>, the choice of protagonist may seem odd, as Krafton Montréal could have chosen any of its other three main races, which are not chickens, for its lead role.</span></p> <p><span>In a recently published interview with </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/project-windless-creative-director-says-the-developers-chose-a-9-foot-warlike-rooster-goliath-as-their-protagonist-because-literally-every-candidate-interviewed-to-work-on-the-game-wanted-to-play-as-one-all-of-them-and-we-were-like-ok/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, Méthé revealed the reason behind the team’s choice of leading man/chicken: every single potential hire Méthé interviewed thought it would be cool. “When every candidate was leaving, they would say, ‘I hope I will hear from you, but one thing for sure, I want to be able to play that character.’ All of them. All of them—and we were like, ‘OK.'”</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, Méthé wasn’t certain that the team had made the correct choice until the first trailer for </span><i><span>Project Windless</span></i><span> premiered at <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291">Sony’s State of Play</a> on February 13. “We knew that the hero would create a shock, but I was surprised by the amount of people who were like, ‘<em>W</em></span><i><span>hat the f—huh?</span></i><span>,</span><em><span>‘</span></em><span> but then were like, ‘I’m in,’ before three quarters of the trailer had even played.”</span></p> <p><span>In a recent </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/former-assassins-creed-and-far-cry-director-says-ubisoft-became-very-allergic-to-new-games-which-contributed-to-a-talent-drain/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> interview, Alex Hutchinson, another ex-Ubisoft creative director who worked on </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed III</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Far Cry 4</span></i><span>, said,</span><span>&nbsp;“[Ubisoft] always had a history of sequelizing the franchises, but also having a couple of new things coming along. They became very allergic to the new things, and so they killed a bunch of our ideas, like when I was working on </span><i><span>Pioneer</span></i><span>. They had nothing new to come through.” Ex-Ubisoft employees have a habit of creating new and exciting games after leaving the studio; Sandfall Interactive, the developers behind 2025’s record-breaking awards darling <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i>, was founded by several former Ubisoft team members.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/he-directed-4-far-cry-games-but-project-windless-is-offering-its-lead-developer-a-chance-hes-been-waiting-for-his-whole-career-i-never-had-the-opportunity-to-work-on-a-medieval-fantasy/"><span>separate interview</span></a><span>, Méthé commented on his transition from working at Ubisoft for over thirteen years, starting with </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Conviction</span></i><span> in 2009 and ending with </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Extraction</span></i><span> in 2022, to working on a medieval fantasy game starring a cockerel. “It’s something that people can take for granted, but because I have a long career I know it’s a rare opportunity to create something new: not with a follow-up, not with a sequel, not with a copy of something else—to have the means and the support to say, ‘You know what? Here’s the universe, create something new.'”</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stage-tour-redoctanes-rhythm-game-revival-set-for-fall-2026/</link>
            <guid>1447822</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stage Tour is the official name of the rhythm game revival attempt from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/redoctane-games/" id="2851">RedOctane Games</a>. A reveal trailer states that the game will be out later this year.</p>



<p>There was a time when rhythm games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band ruled the industry, and living rooms were shapeshifted into grand stages. Now, RedOctane is ready for you to get the band back together with their upcoming game, and they’re not doing it alone.</p>



<p><a href="https://stagetour.com/blogs/news/redoctane-games-announces-stage-tour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A press release</a> states that the development studio reached a multi-year agreement with Gibson to bring more authenticity to the stage.</p>



<p>“For a generation of players, rhythm games transformed music from something you listened to into something you lived—inspiring countless people to pick up real instruments and explore their creativity,” says Taylor Berryman, Sr. Manager, Lifestyle &amp; Licensing at Gibson. “Stage Tour is the next evolution of that influence. We’re thrilled to partner with RedOctane to reimagine what rhythm gaming can be and to spark deeper connection, creativity, and a lifelong love of music for generations to come.”</p>



<p>RedOctane has also partnered with Epiphone and Kramer. The studio has already confirmed that a Gibson Kramer guitar controller will be part of the purchasable bundle when the game is released later this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-more-details-on-stage-tour">More Details on Stage Tour</h2>



<p><a href="https://stagetour.com/pages/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">An FAQ </a>on the official website for the video game notes that it will largely focus on Rock and Metal music. However, other genres may show up at a later time. Aspiring and established artists who want to be featured in the game can contact them and use a form to license their music. “Terminator Oscillator” by Static-X was featured in the trailer.</p>



<p>Stage Tour is also giving players the chance to create the band lineup of their dreams. The game can be played with up to four players. Players can mix any lineup of Lead, Groove, Drums, and Vocals. Each role has its own dedicated peripherals, and it’s fully compatible with gamepads and keyboards.</p>







<h2 id="h-redoctane-s-rhythm-game-roots">RedOctane’s Rhythm Game Roots</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/redoctane-games-launches-to-revive-rhythm-game-genre-with-guitar-hero-devs/">News of this project first surfaced in August 2025.</a> Major names tied to past rhythm game franchises are working on this project. Notably, Simon Ebejer, the Production Director on several Guitar Hero titles during his time at Neversoft, is tied to the project. </p>



<p>Also, Charles and Kai Huang, the original founders of the Guitar Hero franchise, have joined RedOctane’s special advisory board.</p>



<p>The game is currently scheduled to come to PC and a wide variety of platforms. No specific platforms have been announced, however. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor everything surrounding the release of the upcoming rhythm game and report any and all updates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Something in Marathon’s Server Slam Test was Censoring “ARC Raiders” in the Chat]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-was-censoring-arc-raiders-in-its-chat/</link>
            <guid>1447807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Marathon</strong>, the new first-person extraction shooter from <strong>Bungie</strong> is days away from launching at the time of this writing. It'll be out on <strong>PC, PS5, </strong>and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> on <strong>March 5, 2026,</strong> but you can play it right now if you want to on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/"><strong>Server Slam Test</strong>.</a></p>



<p>So far, the test seems to be going well, at least by its player numbers. On Steam, the test has so far peaked at <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/">143,621 concurrent players</a></strong>, and while we'll see how players feel about the game when the test is done, one thing that's already been called out is that, at least when it first launched, the in-game chat in the Server Slam Test was censoring the phrase '<strong>ARC Raiders</strong>.'</p>



<p>Per a report from <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-arc-raiders-censorship-beta-server-slam-2000674097">Kotaku</a>, the bug or whatever was causing this to happen has <strong>since been patched out.</strong> The official X (formerly Twitter) account for the Marathon development team shared that it had been fixed  and added "<em>ARC Raiders is awesome</em>" for good measure.</p>



<p>We've also tested it in the server slam test and can confirm that ARC Raiders is no longer censored in the chat.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We reached out to Bungie to see if we could learn why this happened, but we have yet to hear back. Whether it was a one-in-a-million kind of bug, or Bungie purposely taking a silly shot at the game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/">people have been connecting Marathon to</a>, since they are both extraction shooters, and ARC Raiders is currently one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">best-selling, most popular games in the world,</a> it's pretty weird.</p>



<p>It's also a little bit funny, but still mostly weird. Regardless, it'll be interesting to see how the rest of this server slam test goes, not just with regard to how people come away from it feeling about the game, but also with how effective Bungie's work to stop cheaters in Marathon are.</p>



<p>The studio has made it clear that it will not suffer cheaters. If you're caught, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-cheaters-will-be-permabanned-no-second-chances-says-bungie/">you are permanently banned</a>. You can try to appeal the decision, but any one-time offence will get you banned from Marathon forever, "<em>no second chances</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> isn’t out yet. But you can play a big chunk of it starting today via the “Server Slam” beta on PS5, Xbox, and PC. After completing the tutorial and a few runs on PS5, I’m happy to report that what’s here is better than the version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-arc-raiders-censorship-beta-server-slam-2000674097"><em>Marathon</em></a> we played last year via an early alpha. But I still have some issues with <em>Marathon</em> that have me concerned about its short- and long-term future.</p> <p>The <em>Marathon</em> Server Slam, which runs from today until March 2, features most of the playable runners as well as a few maps, some of the progression system, and a short solo tutorial. Bungie has been very clear with players that this isn’t the full experience, but a taste of <em>Marathon</em> intended to help the studio test server capacity and iron out any major last-minute issues. So let me be very clear also: This isn’t a review or even in-depth impressions about <em>Marathon</em>. This is my feelings and thoughts after a few matches, some of which ended in defeat and two that ended in escape.</p>

 <h2>What I liked in <em>Marathon</em>‘s server slam</h2> <p>First, the good: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheating-bans-marathon-exploits-2000673239">Marathon</a> </em>looks and plays great on PS5. The colorful, neon-futuristic art style and vibes seen in past trailers, marketing, and tests are still here and still awesome. Menus look sharp. Guns look rad. Every building, gun, and item is covered in tiny details alluding to some horrible techno-nightmare that the colonists of Tau Ceti were living through. It also ran perfectly on PS5, with no framerate issues or major performance hiccups. And so far, the servers are holding up pretty well.</p>  <p>The opening tutorial, which feels similar to what was available in the alpha, is also an effective introduction to both the world of <em>Marathon</em> and how this game works. I imagine a lot of people will die in that tutorial once they get into a big fight with some AI bots. I almost did. Some might find that annoying, but I think it’s smart for Bungie to frontload <em>Marathon</em> with an intro that makes it clear that death is just a second away at all times in this tense, high-stakes sci-fi extraction shooter.</p>

 <p>I also have to shout out the guns in <em>Marathon</em>. Each and every one of them sounds perfect. Assault rifles rip apart the air with aggressive blasts while laser-y pistols sound digital and mean. Shooting them makes you feel powerful. Getting shot at is scary as heck. Good stuff. And what else should I have expected? Bungie has always been good at making guns that sound powerful, like thunder in your hands, and <em>Marathon</em> continues that with some of the studio’s coolest-looking guns yet.</p>

 <h2>What I didn’t like in <em>Marathon’s</em> free open beta</h2> <p>Okay, now for the bad parts of the <em>Marathon</em> server slam. Right out of the gate, I was not a fan of how movement and aiming feel while playing with the default settings. Moving around the world and trying to look at items on the ground feels extremely clunky using the default stick options. I recommend changing those ASAP. Turning around to fight using the settings Bungie has chosen is going to be a pain in the ass on console. Increase look speed and decrease the deadzone for the thumbsticks to help make <em>Marathon</em> feel more snappy.</p> <p>It’s really surprising how off this FPS feels, considering it was developed by Bungie, the king of console shooters. I wonder how many will bounce off the game after just a few hours without ever tweaking the settings? Probably more than zero, and if I were Bungie, I’d be tweaking those default settings ASAP.</p>

  <p>Once I got the settings all locked in, moving around the world and getting into firefights with NPCs and other players became a lot more enjoyable. The initial map is a foggy swamp filled with high-tech buildings and dead vehicles to loot and explore. But watch out for the turrets. They can quickly take you down with a few shots, especially if you are limping away from a previous fight. And if you’re playing solo, which I did in a few matches, this will end your run in a frustrating way.</p> <p>Time-to-kill is short, and player engagement feels brief in a way that I’m not sure is going to work for fans of <em>Destiny</em> or <em>Halo</em> hopping over to check out Bungie’s latest FPS. Meanwhile, NPCs can sometimes feel a bit too spongey, especially when using low-rarity weapons. I need to spend more time with the game to really lock in on an opinion, but my knee-jerk reaction is that combat in <em>Marathon</em> is fine.</p> <p>At one point, I was able to escape even after I was downed by a random player. That felt great. I extracted with some loot, resources, and a big smile on my face. In that moment, <em>Marathon</em> clicked, and I could feel myself wanting to hop in and play more. Then the next match ended quickly after a player popped around a corner and downed me in less than two seconds. A teammate tried to help and was killed, too.&nbsp; The pull to play more <em>Marathon</em> lessened after that.</p>

 <p>At the moment, I’m not sure if I like this game or just want to like it. It looks great, sounds awesome, and when you can pull off a cool escape, it feels amazing. It also has an incredible style that is unlike any game out there. But clunky controls that took tweaking to improve, annoying turrets, and a short time-to-kill make it tricky for me to enthusiastically recommend <em>Marathon</em> at the moment. Do I really like <em>Marathon</em>? Or am I just in love with its world and visuals, and also nervous about another live-service shooter eating shit? More data is required.</p>

            <p>
When a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a>, with its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> creators and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-highguards-website-goes-dark-a-report-emerges-that-the-not-so-indie-shooter-was-funded-by-tencent">reported Tencent funding</a>, comes out and just kind of flops, you have to wonder what happened to get it to this point. Well, a new report from Mr. Scoop himself Jason Schreier over at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> appears to have shed a bit of light on the whole palaver through speaking with former Wildlight staffers. 
</p>
<p>
The story goes way back to 2021, when several devs working at Respawn decided to quit to start their own studio, partially for some creative freedom, but with this new report also claiming that part of the reason was simply about money. Specifically, Apex Legends made a whole bunch of it, and its makers felt they weren't getting an even share, so intended for their new studio to include a profit-sharing program, which is part of what helped to bring in several other Respawn staffers.
</p>
<p>
Apparently around two years into development, Wildlight knew that their game wasn't working and was too big in scope, so in January 2024 they began to refine it into what ultimately came to be. There were apparent hopes to develop single-player stories set within the same world, with Highguard serving as a starting point for expansion further down the line.
</p>
<p>
When it came to testing, it was quickly found that the game was only really fun with mics on, and Wildlight staffers said it was a much worse experience without voice chat. Members of the team did apparently suggest conducting tests from the game to start building a community, but management would always shoot this down, hoping to recreate the same success they found with Apex Legends, i.e. keeping it a secret and launching it right after announcing it. 
</p><p>
It's worth noting that the devs at Wildlight felt positive about working at the studio, until the last couple of months around launch, where morale struggled and many started to question the choice for the surprise launch. This launch ultimately didn't work, despite a pretty strong start, but despite the struggle staff believed there was enough money to allow them to keep working on the game to address any issues. But in mid-February, staff were told there wasn't any money, with many believing that the financial support from funders was based on hitting particular metrics the game had failed to meet, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">ultimately resulting in layoffs</a>.
</p>
<p>
A number of former staffers apparently pinned the game's more-or-less failure on the "hubris" of leadership believing they could repeat the success they found with Apex Legends. Now, apparently less than 20 devs are continuing to work on Highguard at Wildlight, with a new mode having arrived <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613785064243442?l=english">just today</a>. In the world of live service, however, 20 people does not seem like enough to keep a game like this going for particularly long. Good luck to those out of work, and those still in it.

		<p>Here’s a mouthful of a game title for you. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction has been given a release date by developer Bitmap Bureau and publisher Limited Run Games, with the side scrolling beat ’em up set to release of April 28th. To mark the announcement you can check out a new gameplay trailer below.</p>

<p>The description for He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction says, <em>“As Eternia prepares for the Royal Festival of Light, Hover Bots attack the palace, revealing the dastardly plan: Skeletor and his allies kidnap King Randor and Queen Marlena and steal the Dragon Pearl! At Castle Grayskull, Skeletor drains the Sorceress’ power into the Pearl, shattering it across the kingdom and leaving her weak. Our heroes, He-Man, Teela, and Man-at-Arms, pursue him across Eternia in this authentic 16-bit tale of sword and sorcery, one 40 years in the making!”</em></p>
<p>For She-Ra fans, worry not as she is an unlockable character that can be used in the campaign. Each character has their own fight style, and He-Man can even ride Battle Cat into battle to take on Skeletor’s minions. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction will feature 12 stages to play through with two player local co-op supported.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855222/qualcomm-hints-we-might-see-windows-gaming-handhelds-at-gdc-in-march">Qualcomm hinted to <em>The Verge</em></a> that it might finally bring its powerful Arm-based Snapdragon processors to Windows gaming handhelds at the 2026 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco — just in time to challenge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/867056/leak-nvidia-n1-n1x-laptops-lenovo-dell">Nvidia’s own first Arm gaming CPU</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857252/intel-handheld-gaming-pc-panther-lake-custom-cpu">Intel’s first dedicated handheld gaming chips</a>.</p></div><p>But plans have shifted, Qualcomm now tells me. It won’t announce any updates to its Snapdragon G Series gaming chips there, nor offer the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853851/qualcomm-snapdragon-x2-plus-elite-laptops-price-ces-2026">recently announced updates to the Snapdragon X line</a> for journalists to try or benchmark.</p><p>“Snapdragon X Series and Snapdragon G Series processors are pushing the PC, desktop, and handheld gaming device industries forward. Our commitment remains strong, and we can’t wait to share more information about these areas,” reads part of a statement to <em>The Verge </em>via Qualcomm spokesperson Cassandra Garcia-Bacha.</p><p>Qualcomm didn’t say why plans have shifted, but it’s not hard to imagine <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/880812/ramageddon-ram-shortage-memory-crisis-price-2026-phones-laptops">that RAMageddon </a>might have something to do with it. In Qualcomm’s February earnings call, president and CEO Cristiano Amon attributed a big dip in its chip business “100 percent” to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/880812/ramageddon-ram-shortage-memory-crisis-price-2026-phones-laptops#:~:text=likely%20to%20define%20the%20overall%20scale">likely define the entire scale of the phone industry</a> all year long.</p><p>In that same call, Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala testified that the company has already seen device manufacturers reduce how much they’re building. “We just wish there was more memory,” said Amon.</p><div><p>And we’ve already seen other impacts in the handheld gaming space. Valve’s Steam Deck is largely sold out; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/885012/the-steam-deck-is-missing-its-fourth-birthday-except-in-the-uk">it all but missed its fourth birthday,</a> February 25th, because it says the shortages are preventing the company from keeping it in stock. They will also impact <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/874196/valve-steam-machine-frame-controller-delay-pricing-memory-crisis">the Steam Machine</a>, and may reportedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/879668/sony-playstation-nintendo-switch-2-console-memory-shortage">impact the Switch 2 and delay Sony’s PS6.</a></p></div><p>But the Windows gaming handheld delay could also have something to do with Microsoft, which has worked very closely with Qualcomm on previous Windows on Arm launches and tightly controls partner announcements.

<p>The new beat ’em up game set in the world of He-Man now has a release date. Get ready to battle across Eternia when He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction releases on April 28, 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/limited-run-games/" id="3641">Limited Run Games </a>announced the release date in a new gameplay trailer during IGN Fan Fest. The trailer’s description noted that there would be 12 stages in the game. Players can choose between four playable characters: He-Man, She-Ra, Man-At-Arms, and Teela. Also, local co-op mode is advertised.</p>



<p>Check out the full trailer, which feels like it stepped right out of the ’80s, below:</p>

<p>He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction attempts to capture the gaming style of the late 80s and early 90s through its sprite work and mechanics. However, it is far from the only game resurrecting nostalgic IP with such a video game. Marvel Cosmic Invasion gave new life to Marvel Comics’ heroes with this game style in 2025. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind and G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra all take a similar approach.</p>



<p>Limited Run Games is also responsible for bringing back a lot of classic beat ’em up games. They recently released the Fighting Force Collection, revitalizing that PS1-era classic duology. Also, they recently announced the Marvel MaXimum Collection. </p>



<p>This forthcoming collection of games will allow players to purchase classic titles from the 16-bit era, such as X-Men: The Arcade Game and Spider-Man &amp; Venom: Maximum Carnage. Learn more about the upcoming collection <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-maximum-collection-includes-x-men-arcade-and-more/" id="180260">here</a>.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide any information regarding He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction leading up to its release. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/samson-a-tyndalston-story-plays-like-a-brawler-set-in-max-paynes-new-york-ign-fan-fest</link>
            <guid>1447747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I first took notice of Samson: A Tyndalston Story when its team of former Just Cause and Mad Max developers posted a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it <a href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1983169469804622067" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teaser</u></a> of Tyndalston itself. The fictional city reminded me of GTA 3’s Liberty City or Max Payne’s New York. My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ex-just-cause-devs-samson-aims-to-be-like-mad-maxpayne"><u>first look at proper gameplay</u></a> in a demo with the creative director only upped my interest, and now that I’ve had the chance to actually play Samson – albeit only for an all-too-brief hour – I’m officially amped for this gritty, grimy, run-down brawler with pseudo-open world freedom where your heavy punch can drop bad guys in one bloody shot and you pop painkillers to stay in the fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setup for this 1990’s-set crime story sees you as Samson McCray, fresh out of prison after eating a charge as a result of a robbery in St. Louis gone bad. Your sister, Oonagh, pulled some strings to help keep you safe while you were inside, and she cut a deal upon your release: you’ve got to repay the money lost from the failed heist to people that will absolutely kill you both if you come even one cent short. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s important to make clear up front is that Samson is not a AAA game. You’d be forgiven for thinking it was at first glance, because its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals are quite impressive, both in terms of Samson’s character model and the city of Tyndalston. Lighting has a very fluorescent-tinged yellow tint to it that you really had to live through the ‘90s to understand, vehicles look great, and the city itself looks very, very lived-in. But Samson doesn’t have the scope of a AAA game, and that’s not a complaint – it’s just important to properly calibrate your expectations. The opening cutscene is not a full-blown cinematic but a voiced-over motion-comic, voice acting is so-so at best, and this isn’t a 40+ hour open-world sandbox. You do plenty of driving around a neighborhood – perhaps more of Tyndalston unlocks the further into the story you progress – but this is not a massive playground full of chatty NPCs and side activities. </p><p>I really like the choices that Samson makes within its more limited scope. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, this isn’t a complaint, but it’s important to emphasize because when you first fire up Samson, it seems like it’s following a very GTA-esque playbook. But I really like the choices that Samson makes within its more limited scope. For instance, there are numerous little things around the world to take note of and interact with, from notes and photos in your apartment to sandwich-board signs you can knock over with your car in order to gain small bursts of nitro boost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It gets better: there is a progression system. The more bad guys you beat up and the more missions you complete, the more XP you earn that gets redeemed for a point in one of four skills: Instinct (boosts your adrenaline), Tactics (health), Aggression (power), and Cunning (finesse). This allows you to tailor your Samson to your preferred playstyle, whether you’d rather absorb and dish out maximum punishment in each fight or strike quickly and frequently in order to speed up the maxing out of your adrenaline meter, at which point you can click in both thumbsticks and enjoy a brief period of dealing extra damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay segments are split into days, and within each day are afternoon, evening, and night. Every time the sun rises, you have to pay back a certain amount of your debt. In order to do that, you’ll need to take various small jobs around Tyndalston. Fortunately, you’ve got choices each day; it’s not a linear mission structure. My first job involved finding the manager of a club called Chubb’s and, well, beating the crap out of him. Naturally, it wasn’t quite so simple. I had to worm my way through the bowels of the club first, fighting my way through his goons in the process. This mission functioned as a bit of a tutorial, allowing me to practice parries, dodges, light punches, heavy punches, and triggering my adrenaline meter after I’d built up enough adrenaline during fights. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Samson Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It didn’t hurt Samson’s chances of me loving this game when the <em>very first dude </em>I threw a heavy punch at dropped immediately, his face covered in his own blood. Most of the time in a game like this, guys can take an unrealistic number of hits. But not in Samson. Not everyone will hit the floor after a single punch, but the fact that it can happen not only made me feel like a badass, but it added to the underworld grittiness that is clearly oozing out of every square inch of Tyndalston.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, back to the missions: as I was saying, you’ve got choices at each segment of the day, but each choice takes a certain amount of time. Meaning, you can’t just do a dozen jobs in a single day in order to quickly pay down your debt and break the game. Every job, realistically, takes time, so when I was, for example, shadowing Dave the Bookie, that took all afternoon of in-game time. First I had to drive to where Dave had last been seen. Then, once I’d clocked him, I had to follow him from a safe distance (lest he recognize the tail and get spooked, triggering a mission failure) so that he’d lead me to evidence of what he was suspected of by the people that I took the job from: that Dave was playing both sides. Sure enough, I caught Dave red-handed, and then I had to square up against Dave and his associates. By the time it was done and I got paid, the day moved to evening.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Samson: A Tyndalston Story - February 2026 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some jobs can only be taken at certain times of day. And some jobs will cost you money. Like when I had to take out the cars of two guys who were avoiding my temporary employer. First I drove to where they’d last been seen, and then both cars came flying around the corner in front of me and the chase was on. The problem was, my car was already pretty beat up from the erratic driving I’d been doing in previous jobs. So the first time I tried the mission, my pursuit led us to a freeway onramp, where I was able to get behind the closest of the two target cars, and then nitro-boost directly into his rear bumper, slamming his car into the curving wall of the onramp and taking it out. Problem was, the bumper boost also took my pre-battered car out, and by the time I’d grabbed another car, the second of the two cars I was pursuing – who was already in front of me – had gotten away. </p><p>The melee combat system feels heavy in a really good way.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the retry, I stopped at a gas station repair shop first, spent some of my hard-earned cash (which, I remind you, I needed every cent of to try and make my daily debt payment), and was then able to keep my car intact while taking out both of my four-wheeled targets. I got paid, and headed home for the evening. But who was waiting for me? Two debt collectors, and so before I could crash on my own couch for the night, I had to bloody my knuckles one more time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/liquidswords-samson-01-1772065215823.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Both combat and driving were a lot of fun in my one-hour hands-on. I have no idea if Samson will ever introduce guns into the mix, but I kinda hope it doesn’t. The melee combat system feels heavy in a really good way, meaning that Samson takes shots just as hard as he dishes them out. I like the mix of punches, parries, and dodging. Sure, the Batman: Arkham combat arguably remains the brawler standard, but Samson’s fisticuffs are slower and more deliberate in a way I quite enjoy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving, meanwhile, also has a welcome weight to it. All of the (fictional) cars in Samson are ‘90s era at the newest, given the ‘90s setting. Samson’s own car is a ‘70s Chevelle-like two-door muscle car, and as such it’s no light Lotus. Are these simulation-style driving physics? Absolutely not. You have the aforementioned nitro boosts and there’s a side-slam button – and of course, the B button lets you pull off sick handbrake turns once you’ve got some practice under your belt. By the end of my hour I had really started to get the hang of the driving and was eager to zip my way around Tyndalston some more. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/liquidswords-samson-city-02-1772065237509.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably tell by now, I had a fantastic time in Tyndalston. If Samson can keep its mission variety fresh – which is no small thing, I recognize – it’ll go a long way towards making its campaign enjoyable over the long haul, versus the extremely fun hour I had with it. I’m curious to see if the city opens up more as the story unfolds, and I hope the story itself is engaging enough to keep me motivated to continue playing and isn’t just “keep doing jobs to pay down your debt until a big climactic mission happens at the end.” Samson is due out on April 8 for PC, so it won’t be too long before we find out if it can keep up the good stuff it’s got going for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

As the valley blacksmith, he's the one who upgrades all the player's tools and opens geodes for them, meaning visiting him regularly is pretty common. But players have wanted to romance him largely because of his awkward relationship with an existing marriage candidate, Emily. Clint has a huge crush on Emily that remains unrequited even the player doesn't marry Emily, but has a few scenes where he seems downright hurt if they do. Giving Clint more of a storyline that his current tactiturn, awkward lines is a much-needed change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandy has also been a requested marriageable villager. She's the manager of the Oasis in the Desert, meaning players don't usually see her until they've played for a while. And unfortunately she never actually leaves the Oasis, so there are fewer opportunities for interactions with her. However, she's kind to the player, leaving the fandom hungry for more Sandy storyline and more interactions with her, which they'll certainly get now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, ConcernedApe opened the video by showing off some old builds of Stardew Valley (then "Sprout Valley") along with his own commentary. The sequence begins with the game's original 2012 look, six months into development, when he had a "functioning game" that was very rudimentary, and similar to the original Harvest Moon game. Even so, you can see how much the basic design of the game looks very similar, right down to where things are located in Pelican Town, the bus, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stardew Valley 10th Anniversary Early Development Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, he shows off a 2013 build that looks a looooot more familiar. The art has been significantly updated to roughly the style of current Stardew Valley. ConcernedApe says this version of the game (now titled "Stardew Valley") was more sandboxy than the current version of the game and less RPG. Additionally, the mines were procedurally generated, and you had to mine into the walls to find ore and secrets. This ended up being too complicated, "too ambitious of a concept for the scope of this game. This should have been a whole game on its own", ConcernedApe said. He also showed off an underground Goblin Village that was totally scrapped. "Just because an idea sounds cool doesn't mean it's fun or the right idea in practice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, ConcernedApe said that nothing in these early builds should be considered "canon" in the Stardew Valley universe.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2014's build introduced the Community Center, but other staples such as Joja Mart and Hat Mouse hadn't been added yet. You also couldn't decorate the inside of your house yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And another build from August 2015, half a year from launch, shows "how much of this came together at the last moment." To my eye, this looks almost identical to launch day Stardew Valley, but ConcernedApe points out various changes like the location of the mailbox, the shape of the inside of the player's house, and the final look of the main character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a reflection on the game's launch, ConcernedApe talks about what the release of the game was like for him and meant to him, including sharing that the game sold just under 40,000 copies in the first day alone, at which point he knew it would be a success. He ended the video with a recap of the game's updates over the years, and by thanking the community for its support over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.7 is coming at a later date. ConcernedApe didn't reveal any further details as to what it might entail for now, but today's announcement should tide everyone over for a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today is Stardew Valley's 10th anniversary, and we celebrated earlier this month already by interviewing ConcernedApe about topics such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-uses-harry-potter-to-explain-why-there-isnt-a-stardew-valley-tv-show">why there isn't a Stardew Valley TV show</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-still-has-1-secret-players-have-never-found-creator-concernedape-confirms">one secret left that the Stardew Valley community has yet to find</a>.
