It wears its heart on its sleeve but keeps its cards close to its chest in the first of its two episodes, and I hope its final chapter will be as compelling as the first when it launches in April because I’m hooked.</p><p><em>Lost Records </em>follows a group of four girls in a fictional small Michigan town called Velvet Cove during the mid-90s. Swann, a socially awkward high schooler whose only friend is her camcorder, is about to leave town for the Great White North. But as her family is packing their lives into boxes, she meets a new group of friends: the straight-laced ice cream shopkeep Autumn, the no-thoughts-head-empty punk Nora, and the angsty writer Kat. The girls are brought together while confronting a local bully, find an abandoned cabin they make into their secret hideout, and create a punk band together. They’ve all got big dreams beyond this small town and even if their time together is short, they’re all more than eager to hype each other up.</p><figure id="" data-id="ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-recommend-id="image://ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-recommend-id="image://ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swann is one of the most compelling video game leads I’ve played in a while. She’s awkward, but spirited and passionate. All of that comes through in the dialogue choices you’re given with her. She can be shy and reserved, but she can also be a little bit of a freak who’s never gotten to let loose with other girls her age. So many of the prompts I got while talking to the rest of the group felt like, in choosing them, I was encouraging Swann to take up space. That can be as simple as letting out a joyful scream as the girls run through the woods, or as weighty as asking your friends if they even want you around.</p><p><em>Lost Records </em>is a nostalgic game that leans into its ‘90s setting, but it also recognizes just how much stays the same as years pass, or even gets worse. The ‘90s story is told through interstitial flashbacks as the girls reunite and reminisce in their 40s. Despite decades between both sides of the story, Swann is still largely the same. As an adult, she’s a bookish nerd who, even after everything the girls have been through together, still doesn’t seem confident they even want her there. That’s the double-edged sword of looking back. You think of the “good ol’ days” and realize that the insecurities you felt then are still around. Maybe you fell back into old habits after so long away from each other, or maybe this is just who you always were.</p><figure id="" data-id="428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-recommend-id="image://428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-recommend-id="image://428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Their time together revisiting the past isn’t all about warm recollections, though; it’s clear something happened in that fateful summer all those years ago that haunts the women to this day. That dark turn in the story begins with a scene in which Kat asks to recite lyrics she’s written for their group. The girls are sitting in a circle out in the woods away from anyone who might judge them, and I was surprised at how affected I was by the vulnerability of Kat just singing a song she wrote for her closest friends. I’m in my 30s, and I know that exposing yourself like that doesn’t get any easier with age. I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">moved to New York City</a></span> two years ago and I’m still painstakingly analyzing every word I say to new connections I make in this city, like it’s a negotiation for their time and attention and I’m trying to make my case. But when you’re a teenager everything you feel is so raw, and every request to be seen by those around you feels like the riskiest thing you’ve ever done. That’s the barrier Swann is pushing against throughout <em>Lost Records</em>’ first half.</p><p>In the present day, I see Swann is still friendly with her old group, but each dialogue option feels high-stakes, despite all the years they’ve known each other. Making a choice in <em>Lost Records </em>is accompanied by an icon of either a whole or broken heart, signifying each girl’s reaction to it. Swann’s awkward demeanor and her clear desire to be accepted by her first real, close friends made every broken heart icon sting. The paranoia of saying the wrong thing to someone you still don’t know that well but would like to can stay with you long after your awkward teenage years are behind you, and <em>Lost Records</em> makes this agonizing reality a game mechanic. It’s so well executed that I winced for Swann whenever I said the wrong thing and maybe made one of the other girls sad or uncomfortable. It ate at me until the credits rolled, not unlike remembering a dumb interaction with a new friend hours after it happened.</p><figure id="" data-id="c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-recommend-id="image://c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-recommend-id="image://c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swann feels most herself when she doesn’t have to talk at all and is instead behind her camcorder taping all the group’s shenanigans. <em>Lost Records</em> trades <em>Life Is Strange</em>’s superpowers for a <em>Pokémon Snap</em>-like mechanic of recording your friends, nature, wildlife, and the citizens of Velvet Cove. Looking for enough shots to complete different themed videos can become a bit of a tedious collectathon, but I liked bringing out my photojournalism schooling to line up good shots and see the final montage. The system Don’t Nod uses to recognize if you’re recording the right thing is forgiving enough that you don’t feel restricted and can be expressive with your cinematography. It’s a mostly fun detour on your way to the game’s more impactful moments, but the best parts of <em>Lost Records </em>happen when Swann puts the camera down and has to relate to her friends without a buffer.</p><p>The first half of <em>Lost Records </em>only gestures at the bigger picture until it nears the end of its roughly six-hour run time. Something unspeakable happened in the ‘90s, and even as middle-aged women, Swann and her friends struggle to talk about it. But as they trace their footsteps to how they all found themselves back in Velvet Cove in their 40s, they will have to confront the truth, as much as some of them seem hesitant to do so. Don’t Nod has been gradually lowering the number of episodes in its episodic adventure games since the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>’s year-long run in 2015. So at the very least <em>Lost Records</em> won’t take too much longer. I just hope the second half lives up to the first when it launches on April 15.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals players will finally be able to exchange their leftover Chrono Tokens from the battle pass into something more useful. After having to let those extra tokens go to waste earlier, players that complete the Season 1 pass can get rewarded for their extra efforts.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-adds-new-chrono-token-exchange-system">Marvel Rivals Adds New Chrono Token Exchange System</h2>



<p>In the developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> for the upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 update, the team at NetEase confirmed the new Chrono Token redemption system. Players that own the Luxury battle pass and redeem all the rewards can convert leftover Chrono Tokens into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Units used in the store</a>. “Luxury” just refers to the paid pass itself: you did not need to buy the more expensive version that came with extra Chrono Tokens to be eligible for the new redemption system. Any player who buys the pass and redeems all its awards will be able to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units.</p>



<p>This issue was a major community talking point during Season 0. The shortened season features a much smaller battle pass that could be completed rather quickly, but players were still completing daily and weekly challenges and earning Chrono Tokens that completely went to waste. With the new system, it should encourage players to continue playing and completing challenges even if they’ve completed the pass.</p>



<p>Potentially, this change could result in a little bit less spending of Lattice at the store. However, that all depends on what the ratio of Chrono Tokens to Units will be, which NetEase hasn’t revealed yet. Marvel Rivals fans should temper their expectations now, as it’s very unlikely that it will even be close to a 1:1 ratio. Season 1.5 officially goes live on February 21.</p>



<p>Inspired to complete the seasonal battle pass now? Let us know down below in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

This quest begins whenever you find a Fragment of Starmetal and requires you to reach the final map of the game to complete it. The Fragments of Starmetal are difficult enough to find, but having to potentially wait dozens of hours to find out what the metal does can be agonizing.</p><p>Fortunately, the quest is worth the wait, as you can score yourself an incredible weapon in Avowed with the Starmetal.

You can view the quest in your journal but the game offers nothing in the way of an explanation for what to do with the metal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png"></figure><p>You can find a Fragment of Starmetal as early as Dawnshore, but unfortunately, you have to go through every single map in the game until you can use it. If you speak to certain vendors across the three maps of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp, you can ask about the Starmetal. Specifically, asking blacksmiths about the metal will yield the most answers.</p><p>Regardless of who you speak to about the Starmetal, though, you'll get told the same thing: The Starmetal can only be worked by a smith in Solace Keep. Solace Keep is the main hub city in the final map of Avowed, called Galawain's Tusks. You can only reach this map by progressing through Avowed's main story. So, if you happen to find the Fragment of Starmetal in Dawnshore, you'll have to go through the events of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp before you're finally able to do something with the item.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_into_Solace_Keep_and_complete_Forged_of_Star_Stuff">How to get into Solace Keep and complete Forged of Star-Stuff</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585"></a><figcaption>Talking to Forgemaster Dela in Solace Keep</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png"></figure><p>When you finally reach Galawain's Tusks, you need to travel all the way north to Solace Keep.

This goes into the forge, where Foregmaster Dela is standing in front of a statue. Talk to Dela and show him the Starmetal you have in your inventory. He'll start to clamor over the metal and offer to make you a unique weapon from it. You have the choice between a Starmetal Sword or an Arquebus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584"></a><figcaption>The unique Moonstrike arquebus weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png"></figure><p>The unique sword is called Meteor Blade while the unique arquebus is called Moonstrike. Both are fantastic weapons, but the Moonstrike is a little bit better and more useful, in my opinion. However, if you find more Fragments of Starmetal, you can bring them back to Dela and he will make you more weapons with them, allowing you to possess several unique Starmetal weapons. You can also bring more Starmetal to Dela so he can upgrade your existing weapon.</p><p>Forged of Star-Stuff doesn't end until you find the location of every Fragment of Starmetal in Avowed, but once you have one weapon, the quest is essentially completed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png"></figure><p>So far, we know of four different Fragment of Starmetal locations, but there are certainly more on the map that have yet to be discovered. Here are the four locations we know of:</p><ul><li><strong>Galawain's Tusks</strong>: Right beside the Ash Forest in a meteor pit where the Revenant bounty is located (northwest of Solace Keep)</li><li><strong>Dawnshore</strong>: At the Godless Altar directly south of the gate to Emerald Stair on the eastern side of the map</li><li><strong>Shatterscarp</strong>: In the Abandoned Mines directly across from Ruanga's house (seen during the One Last Drink side quest)</li><li><strong>Emerald Stair</strong>: Right underneath the Damp Burrow text in the northern part of Emerald Stair on a rock (to the east of the Abandoned Farms and Rolling Crags)</li></ul><p>We'll update this guide with more fragment locations if they are discovered. All you really need is one to complete the Forged of Star-Stuff quest in Avowed, but like we said, a few more overpowered weapons surely don't hurt, right? Well, they don't hurt <em>you</em>, anyway.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

Sanza is missing one last cartographer somewhere in the fiery region and it's your job to find out where they are. Unlike the other cartographers in Mapping the Living Lands, however, the one in Galawain's Tusks is alive and well, and you have a decision to make regarding their fate.</p><p>To see where the Galawain's Tusks cartographer is located in Avowed and how to finally complete Mapping the Living Lands, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>Galawain's Tusks Cartographer location in Avowed</h2><p>Unfortunately, the cartographer in Galawain's Tusks is just about as far as possible from the starting position in the region. You have to travel all the way north to Solace Keep and then find a jail tower where the cartographer is being held prisoner. This jail tower is called "Soreena's Mercy" and it's located to the northwest of Solace Keep.</p><p>You don't have to enter Solace Keep or complete any additional story missions in Avowed to reach the cartographer. You don't even have to actively track the new Mapping the Living Lands quest. So, if you want, you can head straight there and find the cartographer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445557-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.06.10.54.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445557-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.06.10.54.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445557"></a><figcaption>The map location for the Galawain's Tusks cartographer in Avowed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445557-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.06.10.54.png"></figure><p>At Soreena's Mercy, head inside and travel up one flight of stairs. At the very end of the prison cells, you'll see an NPC standing outside of one of the cells. There's a person inside named Renato, who you can speak to through the cell.</p><p>Renato is Sanza's missing cartographer, and he was arrested by the Wardens at Solace Keep for stealing supplies so he could stay alive to complete his mission for Sanza. As you continue speaking with him, you'll be able to make a choice regarding his fate. You can either convince the Warden to release Renato, which isn't too difficult, or you can say you're going to take his map and leave him to rot in the cell for his crimes. The alternative is to fight the Warden and free Renato yourself, but that's mostly unnecessary unless you're playing a more aggressive character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558"></a><figcaption>Choosing to free Renato or leave him in the cell. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png"></figure><p>If you choose to free Renato, he will end up giving you his cartography map anyway. If you take his map and make him stay in the cell, the outcome is the same, as you can take the map back to Sanza in Paradis to complete the Mapping the Living Lands quest. This is the last of these quests in Avowed, so if you've completed the other three regions, you're officially done with this questline.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

The mid-season update will also add The Thing and Human Torch, along with a new map and balance update.</p><p dir="ltr">Shared in the <a href="https://youtu.be/FMPCzylKgc8?si=jxolri2w_qBGMha6&amp;t=189" rel="nofollow ">Marvel Rivals Dev Vision</a>, leftover Chrono Tokens, the battle-pass currency, will be exchanged for Units, an in-game currency used to buy cosmetics from the store, like hero skins. While the exact ratio wasn't revealed in the video, this exchange will be available to players who have purchased the premium version of the battle pass and redeemed all of the rewards in the battle pass. If you meet those two requirements by the end of the season, whatever tokens you have left will be exchanged at whatever the ratio is. It wasn't stated if the ratio will be revealed along with the patch notes for the mid-season update, or if it will be revealed towards the end of Season 1.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FMPCzylKgc8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Tokens are earned exclusively from challenges--daily, season, or event--so players cannot earn them endlessly. However, in Season 0 there were certainly far more tokens that could be earned than needed to unlock every item in the battle pass, and the Season 1 battle pass is tracking to be similar. Marvel Rivals battle passes don't expire, so this exchange offers a reward for players who finish a battle pass within the same season it's released.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 1 mid-season update drops on Friday, February 21, bringing a new Duelist and Vanguard to the roster, along with a new map and balance updates, like some much needed nerfs for certain Strategist ultimates.</p>

In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, senior game designer Daniel Holt talked about the collaboration and this initial look, which focuses on four major character cards and their associated pre-constructed Commander decks.</p><p>The revealed cards include Terra from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, Tidus from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, Y’shtola from (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">critically acclaimed MMORPG</a>)<em> <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></em>, and of course, Cloud from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> adds various new tinctures of wyvern, toad monster and arachnid to the fantasy creature chopper's vaunted eco-stew, but that additional variety isn't quite apparent from the weapon types. They're fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it's a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007.</p>
<p>Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4's Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it's more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"When we start development of games such as World and, recently, Wilds, we always consider whether or not this is the time to add another weapon type," Tokuda told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-wilds/new-weapon-type">PCGamesN</a> via translator in a recent interview. "It's not off the table for any particular reason, it's just that we never really decided that we wanted to for the recent titles."</p>
<p>The game's current arsenal includes 14 categories of large animal evisceration, from the relatively fool-proof Greatsword to the fussier Hunting Horn, aka Magic Murder Trumpet. It's tricky, Tokuda said, to envisage "a 15th weapon that would actually have a place in that lineup and feel equally as valid as the other weapon types while also not overlapping with them too much."
</p>
<p>
"It's a very difficult thing," he went on. "With each title we always adjust all the weapon types and maybe bring new concepts to them and their relationships with each other to make them feel fresh. We also bring new depth with new combos and moves. The resources and time that it takes to do that is something that, in every case since the last weapon was added, we've always decided were better spent bringing the whole lineup to a better place than to simply start adding another new one in."
</p>
<p>In the case of Wilds, Capcom have also had to wrangle with the problem of what to bring back from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>'s Iceborne expansion - the last home format Monster Hunter release, which was aimed at more proficient players. "People who were playing a given weapon in Iceborne were assumed to have mastered the basics and it was going beyond that with adding new combos and moves and abilities," Tokuda told the site.</p>
<p>
I haven't really felt the need for fresh weaponry in Munster Honker of late. I've been distracted by all the talk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ghastly-spider-monster-is-actually-key-to-the-games-more-approachable-design">atrocious pedagogic spiders</a>. But adding to and balancing Monster Hunter's arsenal sounds more intriguing than doing likewise for, say, Call Of Duty, because of course, every Monster Hunter weapon has to come from a monster.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered siloing off their monster design teams, feeding them a lot of fermented berries, and having them challenge the blacksmiths by putting together a menagerie that defies weaponisation. Here's a rare species of wyvern that consists entirely of balloons! Here's an insect monster made of nested triangles! Here's a dinosaur that's so thin it's only visible from the side! Let's see you make another Gunlance out of that.

                <p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> at some point later this year remains one of the biggest stories in gaming. It's not a question of whether it will be one of the biggest releases of 2025; it's about how big it can be at launch and in the years to come. Now, a new report suggests that Rockstar Games is going to expand GTA 6 even further by turning the game into a platform for user-generated content.</p><p>According to <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digiday</a>, Rockstar is in talks with experienced Roblox and Fortnite creators in addition to GTA mod creators about creating customized experiences in Grand Theft Auto 6. It's not that far of a conceptual leap, since there are already numerous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> mods, and because Rockstar purchased FiveM, which lets players take part in modified versions of the game with hundreds of other users.</p><p>The belief among some industry insiders is that Rockstar will follow the example of Fortnite and allow users to create customized locations and items that could be purchased by other players or accessed via subscriptions. Any money earned from these creations would likely include a sizable share for Rockstar itself, while also giving modders the chance to make money as well.</p><p>"It is my firm belief that is the reason that they purchased FiveM is exactly that--to spin up a metaversal universe of custom-built experiences, and potentially UGC items, with an attached UGC creator economy," said WPP agency Wavemaker's global and esports lead Pete Basgen in the Digiday report. "It will essentially occupy that adult-enumerated space at the top of the ecosystem; there's a very natural place there for people that graduate from Roblox and Minecraft."</p><p>While GTA 6 user-created content could be extremely lucrative, GTA Online players have been concerned that the game will be discontinued after Grand Theft Auto 6 launches. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA Online could continue to exist</a> alongside GTA 6, but he declined to outright confirm that. Zelnick also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">a PC port for GTA 6 won't be released at launch</a>. The game itself still doesn't have a firm release window, but since Take-Two has set <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4</a> for a late September release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">the drop date for GTA 6 may be coming into focus</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-nerfing-the-new-triple-strategist-meta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals competitive players have been embracing the triple-strategist meta, but the devs are not letting it dominate the higher ranks thanks to some upcoming nerfs. The new <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1891880359345950886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>, which will go in effect at the start of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 second half</a>, shouldn’t kill the triple-strategist meta, but will make it less “oppressive.”</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-loki-other-strategists-to-receive-ultimate-nerfs">Cloak &amp; Dagger, Loki, Other Strategists to Receive Ultimate Nerfs</h2>



<p>The triple-strategist meta has become very popular in competitive Marvel Rivals play. With three characters providing healing and support, vanguards (tanks) can absorb far more damage, making it hard to slow down attacking teams during convoy games. However, the devs have noted concerns that characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki can charge their ultimate abilities really quickly. Because of this, teams running triple-initiator always seem to have an ultimate ready to counter one from an opposing duelist or vanguard.</p>



<p>In the Season 1 mid-season update, the energy costs for “frequent ultimates” like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki’s will be increased. Certain ultimates will also receive targeted nerfs, and the devs have explicitly stated that Cloak &amp; Dagger will be one of the recipients. Further more, some vanguards and duelists such as Venom and Magik will also get a lower energy cost to their ultimates, allowing them to be used more frequently.</p>



<p>These changes will go hand-in-hand with some more announced hero balance changes:</p>



<ul>

<p>The game’s lead combat designer said the goal is not to get rid of playstyles like the triple-strategist meta, but only to encourage other playstyles and provide an appropriate amount of counterplay opportunities. These changes will officially go into effect when the second half of Season 1 begins on February 21.</p>



<p>Is nerfing the triple-strategist meta the right call for Marvel Rivals? Let us know down below in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>When Shuhei Yoshida stepped down as president of SIE Worldwide Studios to lead indie games in 2019, it wasn’t something he outright chose to do. In fact, Yoshida only had two options: go lead a the new initiative with indies or leave PlayStation altogether.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida said that despite only having the one option, it was something he was still excited to do.</p>



<p>“Moving from first-party to indies? Well, I had no choice,” Yoshida said. “When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company. </p>



<p>“But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose.”</p>



<p>Yoshida said that moving from first-party games  to indies was a bigger challenge for him than ultimately leaving the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year after 31 years</a>. He said that he feels lucky that the indie community felt like he could help their growth on PlayStation.</p>



<p>“I became an adviser for some of these companies,” he said. “I’m continuing to work with some of the indie publishers and developers I respect. The transition out of Sony to becoming an independent adviser is less of a change than moving out of first-party.”</p>



<p>Following up on that statement, Yoshida said that will continue to work with indies despite no longer being with PlayStation. He says that he loves working with younger, talented developers who “come up with amazing games every year.”</p>



<p>“Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies,” he said. “They’re bringing something exciting to the industry. It’s a lot of fun. That’s my dream job, to be able to help them.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshida saying he either took the indie leadership position or left PlayStation in 2019?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-channels-the-spirit-of-a-forgotten-god-of-war-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This past weekend saw the first round of network tests for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, the upcoming standalone multiplayer game spun out of FromSoftware’s magnum opus. Unlike last year’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, Nightreign resembles Elden Ring in name and appearance only, trading its parent game’s open world structure for a streamlined survival format in which three-player teams have to drop into gradually shrinking maps to fight off groups of enemies and increasingly challenging bosses. It’s a design that undoubtedly suggests the developers were inspired by the hugely popular Fortnite – unsurprising, considering Epic’s battle royale has been enjoyed by no less than 200 million players this month alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Nightreign bears an even greater resemblance to another game, one not nearly as famous and much more disliked: 2013’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ascension">God of War: Ascension</a>. And that’s a good thing. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/god-of-war-ascension-1739888453295.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Sony Santa Monica / Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Released between 2010’s God of War 3 and 2018’s Norse-flavored God of War reboot, Ascension was a prequel set before the original Greek mythology trilogy that followed Kratos as he tried to break his oath with his soon-to-be-predecessor, Aries. Unable to live up to the initial trilogy’s epic finale, and fueling desire to shake up a tried-and-tested formula, God of War: Ascension quickly became known as the black sheep of the franchise. A half-decent appetizer to an amazing main course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an understandable reputation, but also unfair. Although Kratos’ confrontation with the Furies in Ascension obviously didn’t reach the same heights as his five-stage fight with Zeus, this divisive prequel still had some truly jaw-dropping set-pieces, including the Prison of the Damned, a labyrinthine dungeon carved into the skin and bones of an immobilized, 100-armed giant. But, more importantly, Ascension also deserves credit for trying something the franchise had not done before, and hasn’t since: multiplayer. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Trial of the Gods, is cooperative PvE. And also basically Elden Ring Nightreign. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you make your way through the Prison of the Damned in Ascension’s story, you encounter a chained up NPC who lets out a premature “You saved me!” before being crushed by the level’s boss. Open up the multiplayer mode after reaching this point in the campaign and you’ll find this same NPC is now your player character. Having been teleported to Olympus seconds before your demise, you must pledge allegiance to one of four gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, or Aries – each of whom will provide you with unique weapons, armor pieces, and magic attacks. These are the tools with which you wage war across five different multiplayer modes, four of which are competitive PvP.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fifth mode, Trial of the Gods, is cooperative PvE. And also basically Elden Ring Nightreign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay previews of Nightreign posted ahead of the network tests by prominent “Soulsborne” YouTubers like VaatiyVidya and Iron Pineapple, as well <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-first-impressions-of-the-network-test-build">IGN’s own coverage</a>, have revealed the similarities between FromSoftware’s latest and live service games like Fortnite. Much like those games, Nightreign offers a cocktail of randomized loot, resource management, and environmental hazards that damage a player’s health and limit their area of movement, making runs more challenging as they go on. Nightreign even pays homage to one of Fortnite’s most iconic images, having players drop into the level from the sky, taxied by spirit birds to a position of their choosing. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/eldenring-nightreign-01-4k-1734054366417.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find any “where are we dropping?” action in God of War: Ascension, but go beyond Nightreign’s battle royale-like surface and you’ll find much more common ground. Both Nightreign and Ascension’s Trial of the Gods mode are co-op experiences where teams of two or more face increasingly tougher foes. Both grant players the unexpected but welcome opportunity to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">take on bosses from previous games</a>, be they Hercules from God of War 3 or the Nameless King from Dark Souls 3. Both have a countdown (although Ascension’s can be paused by defeating enemies) and both take place on maps that are either small or shrinking. And both are multiplayer games developed by studios known for their well-crafted single-player experiences, and were made without oversight from their series’ creators; Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki is working on an as of yet unknown project, while the directors of the original God of War trilogy – David Jaffe, Cory Barlog, and Stig Asmussen – had all left Sony Santa Monica at the time of Ascension’s creation to pursue opportunities elsewhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Above all, Nightreign appears to evoke the same response from players as Ascension’s Trial of the Gods did. Those who participated in FromSoftware’s network test invariably describe their runs as a frantic and exhilarating race against the clock. In contrast to the comparatively cozy vibes of the base game, where players are able to tackle every scenario in a variety of ways, using a variety of weapons and abilities and taking all the time they need, Nightreign forces players to act on instinct by picking up the pace and limiting their resources – constraints that, in <a href="https://youtu.be/7xjW5oGlcUM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VaatiVidya’s words</a>, were “made in the name of speed and efficiency.” To make up for the absence of Torrent, for instance, players now channel their inner spirit horse, being able to run faster and jump higher. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ascension’s multiplayer adjusted its single player blueprint for the sake of tighter pacing, using similar techniques to those adopted by Nightreign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascension’s multiplayer also adjusted its single player blueprint for the sake of tighter pacing, and even used similar techniques to those adopted by Nightreign: it increased the player’s run speed, extended their jumps, automated parkour, and provided them with a grapple attack they could use to pull objects towards them (a mechanic also used by Nightreign’s Wylder character). New moves like this are a lifesaver, because while the combat isn’t too difficult on its own – what with the franchise being a power fantasy and all – Trial of the Gods throws so many enemies at you that every second counts. As a result, you and your teammate find yourselves sprinting around like hungry wolves, or terminators, or, well, Kratoses, hacking and slashing your way through armies without calculated ruthlessness. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign’s resemblance to Ascension is unexpected not only because much of the latter has been forgotten, but also because the Soulslike genre Elden Ring is part of essentially started out as God of War’s complete antithesis. Where one lets you pretend to be a warrior so powerful he can kill literal gods, the other turns you into a nameless, accursed undead for whom even regular enemies pose a considerable challenge. One rarely shows its game over screen, the other beats you over the head with it until you start crying, laughing, and crying again.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet this challenge, so utterly rage-inducing in FromSoftware’s earlier games, has gradually decreased in recent years as fans “got good” and developers provided them with better weapons and spells, culminating in the numerous game-breaking builds that have been put together since Elden Ring launched. Without access to these builds, Nightreign promises to reintroduce a degree of challenge. At the same time, those that have indeed gotten good will be able to enjoy the same thing God of War: Ascension offered: the chance to feel like a vengeful Spartan short on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

<p dir="ltr">Spencer also mentioned State of Decay 3 as part of the same section, with the Xbox boss calling the series "one that I love." Later in the interview, Spencer said that studios like Rare are allowed more time to make long-in-the-oven games like Everwild because Xbox's current slate is already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-has-more-games-slated-for-ps5-this-year-than-sony-so-far/1100-6529489/" data-ref-id="1100-6529489">packed with games</a>. He also indicated that the next studio he's going to visit is The Coalition, the stewards of the Gears of War franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Everwild is one of those "missing games" that it's easy to forget about, given that it was first announced in 2019, even before the start of the current console generation. A 2022 report suggests that the project was internally rebooted following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-boss-resigns-from-rare-marking-another-high-profile-xbox-departure/1100-6483926/" data-ref-id="1100-6483926">the departure</a> of the game's creative director Simon Woodroffe back in 2020. Everwild's current director is Gregg Mayles, a Rare veteran who worked on games like Sea of Thieves, Viva Pinata, and Banjo-Kazooie. We still have no word on a potential release date for Everwild.</p>

			<p>Stockholm-based independent developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fellowship</a>, an upcoming 'multiplayer online adventure game' (MODA), will be playable in a Public Playtest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available </a>during next week's Steam Next Fest from February 24 to March 3.</p>
<p>For the Public Playtest, there will be servers available in North America, Europe, and Asia. In this preview build, players will have the chance to experience six heroes (two Tanks, two DPS – including a new DPS, Tariq, and two Healers) that will be in Fellowship's roster, go on dungeon runs (both Ranked Dungeons and Quick Play Dungeons), take on challenging enemies and acquire epic loot.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Public Playtest, Wccftech was invited for a private play session with the developers. The best analogy really is dungeons from massively multiplayer online roleplaying games (MMORPGs), played after selecting a roster of predefined heroes, each in a specific role of the so-called Holy Trinity (Tank/DPS/Healer). Fellowship strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like. The replayability is also enhanced by Curses, which are gameplay modifiers on the dungeons that are mechanical extra layers that you have to deal with, and these keep rotating for each difficulty and each dungeon you do.</p>
<p>As someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time on MMORPGs, the core concept definitely has a lot of merit. However, I found the execution lacking, mainly because it sticks way too closely to what MMORPGs have been doing for over twenty years. I'm referring particularly to the tab-target combat system, which felt very static and somehow even worse than World of Warcraft's in this regard. The dungeon mechanics I've seen, while introductory, are interesting; but it won't be enough if the combat itself is too stale. In short, yes, I would have attempted action combat, or at least a hybrid system like those featured in games like Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>The graphics are also not at all impressive for a game that's made with Unreal Engine 5. It obviously follows the Blizzard mandate to deliver stylized graphics and ensure maximum compatibility, but one thing's for sure, you won't be playing Fellowship because of its visuals.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's my conversation with Chief Rebel during the play session. The studio was established in 2018 by developers who previously worked on games like World of Warcraft, Diablo, Helldivers, Battlefield, Tom Clancy's The Division, Just Cause, and more.</p>

<p><strong>What's the core premise behind your game?</strong></p>
<p>In many MMOs, this high-complexity PVE content is gated behind hundreds of hours of leveling up. We want to make sure that Fellowship is approachable for newer players and something quick to jump in for veterans.</p>
<p><strong>I see there's a kill score count. Can you explain what it does?</strong></p>
<p>The kill score kind of totals the amount of enemies that we should kill in a dungeon run, so we can't just find some clever route to skip to the bosses. If you hit M on your keyboard, by mousing over enemies on the map, you can kind of see what percentage of the kill score they fill. As a tank who's kind of leading the direction we're going, I can pick out which routes I want lead the party through. But you have to fill the kill score to 100% and kill all the bosses to complete the dungeon, but there's a lot more enemies than 100% in the dungeon.</p>
<p>The intention is, especially when you get to the higher tier and the leaderboard chasing, part of the strategy is finding a good route through the dungeon, what paths should the party skip, what are more dangerous or maybe worth taking, even though they're dangerous using pull downs and all that.</p>
<p>When the timer gets turned on, then you also have to beat the dungeon within the timer to get to the next difficulty, but you're still gonna get all the loot that you would get from the dungeon, regardless of whether you beat the timer. We don't activate the timer until difficulty 4, though.</p>
<p><strong>I assume the timer is going to be a key factor in climbing the leaderboard.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. The timer affects the score as well, so when players start to get to the really high difficulties, it's gonna be a matter of practically milliseconds to determine who's number one on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>By the way, as you can see on the left, we have all kinds of metrics for players to look at just to be able to see how they are improving and how different talents or stats on their gear is affecting their damage or damage mitigation or healing.</p>
<p>You can see each of us there above the action bar. You see our health bars (I'm the purple dude), and you can see on the damage meter how we're doing on that damage, and then, if you mouse over those, you can actually view a breakdown of what abilities are contributing to your damage.</p>
<p>This is also really important if you're going to get into optimizing your gameplay and being competitive and learning how to complete dungeons at really high difficulty, but it's not as important when starting out because, of course, we tune the game to be very forgiving in the beginning.</p>
<p>One of the barriers for a lot of players in some of these types of games is stuff like the DPS meter isn't built into these MMOs. It's something that you have to go online and search for and you gotta download add-ons and all that. As a player trying to find your role in the community, it can be a bit difficult to find your footing.</p>
<p>So, we don't really have any intentions of allowing player-made addons in Fellowship. Instead, we want to make sure that we're providing everything that veteran players want and expect in the game itself to ensure a level playing field for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Aren't you worried about online toxicity? Some MMORPGs have tried to move away from DPS meters mainly because of that issue.</strong></p>
<p>I think that toxicity is always something that there's work to do with. I think that the solution is not to remove the ability for players to understand how to get better. I mean, there's different types of games. In some, your performance doesn't really matter, but in a game where your performance matters, you need to have information to be able to know what to change to improve, or you'll just start to hit your head against the wall.</p>
<p>If there's any kind of competitiveness, just removing data, I don't think that's the solution. I think that needs to be worked with in other ways. We're trying to find lots of other ways of getting ahead of that as well.</p>

<p><strong>How do you plan on dealing with the 'meta' situation in your game?</strong></p>
<p>In a lot of the MMOs or games where you're playing with a group, inevitably, a meta is going to be established. One of the reasons why you may choose one character or one class over another is because they have a utility ability that's really important to have at high levels of difficulty. In Fellowship, we've moved a lot of those big utility skills like mass dispel to equippable items that you unlock in higher difficulties so that anyone can bring a battle resurrection or a dispel or stuff like that to a party.</p>
<p>One thing you might notice as well is that we're trying to look into how we can handle some nonverbal communications. If you target one of these buccaneers and you hit V on the keyboard, you'll put your hero portrait next to their name. If you put your marker up and interrupt the enemy, you can see when we interrupt ours, meaning you'll know the cooldown on our interrupt skills so we can more easily manage the cooldowns of the whole group. This is another example where, at low difficulties, interrupting is not that important, but when you start to get to very high difficulties, not interrupting might get you one-shotted. So, it's really important for players to be able to coordinate and work together to ensure they have all the interrupts ready.</p>
<p><strong>How many skills is each hero going to offer?</strong></p>
<p>We're going to have 15 abilities available for each of the heroes. You unlock more and more abilities as you reach higher difficulties. What you're starting out with is just the interrupt, the movement skill, and some basic core kit, but then a lot of the abilities that come are CCs, utilities, cooldowns, and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the various dungeons and boss fights?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. As the difficulty rises, bosses and enemies in the dungeon learn new abilities. What we're seeing here is this boss's base kit and then, as you get higher, she'll get some new tricks that make the boss a little bit more interesting for when you're ready for the increased challenge.</p>
<p>In Fellowship's dungeons, we have 3 bosses to kill. They take around 20 to 30 minutes to complete, depending on gear, difficulty, skill level, et cetera. And then we also have Adventures in the game. These are single-boss dungeons that take about 10 to 12 minutes to complete. You can compete in both formats for the leaderboard score. To get higher on the leaderboards, you need to improve the average score of all your dungeons. But if you're someone for whom half an hour is a bit too much of an investment to put in, you can just jump in and do the 10-minute ones and still get the full conversion and all that.</p>
<p><strong>Does Fellowship include some sort of crafting?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have a bunch of different progression systems. Firstly, there are talents that are hero-specific, where you'll unlock ways to customize your hero.&nbsp;There's also the gear itself that has different types of stats, like Crit, Haste, Expertise, and more.</p>
<p>Once you get a little bit higher in difficulty, you'll start to obtain the transmutation resources. This is kind of a crafting system where you can use transmutation resources and some of the gold you earn to transmute items that you've gotten that you don't need. It kind of functions like a bad luck protection thing for loot. If you keep getting the same cloak all the time, you can transmute those cloaks and if you're lucky, you can reroll them into something you actually need.</p>
<p>Then we also have scrapping loot, which gives you resources, and you can upgrade loot as well. One of the bigger systems is also once you get gems and sockets unlocked. We're doing a lot more with gems and sockets than most RPGs do, so it's not just stats on those gems. The gems also unlock new defensive abilities and offensive abilities, passive ones, props and stuff, and do some cool stuff with your character as well.</p>
<p>At the end of a dungeon, you get your loot for completing it. If you right-click on the chest, but you can click on your items to collect them, and on the right side, you can see what everybody in your party got.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that. One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Is there any way to trade these items if you don't need something and your friend does?</strong></p>
<p>No trading yet. That'll be something we'll potentially look into as part of the live service.</p>
<p><strong>How many heroes will be playable at launch?</strong></p>
<p>We haven't set an exact number. It'll be somewhere around 8 or 9, maybe, at launch. Of course, we are planning to regularly release new heroes in live service as well as dungeons and adventures and other types of formats of playing as well eventually.</p>
<p><strong>They are all limited to a single role, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes. Like, we could have a character that's a slime blob that clones into other heroes and can use their abilities for a while or any kind of stuff that we want to explore eventually. But we will be starting off with a good, strong foundation of heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you settle on a 4-player group format?</strong></p>
<p>We even experimented with 3, but what we noticed is that when you go down to 3, you only have 1 because we really want to lean into the Holy Trinity, which is the tank healer DPS roles. When you have a party of 3, you're really losing like an X factor, a permutation of the kind of setups you can do with your team.</p>
<p>So, 4 felt like a good number, and just from playtesting, we felt like we're not missing anything with a group of 4 instead of 5. It still feels like we're able to give the same complexity. There's a sweet spot in terms of mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Is this going to be a shared world hub with more players than just your group?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub. If someone else logged in now, they would spawn here with us until we hit the cap for the stronghold and then a new one spins up.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss what the post-launch would look like for Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>There's lots of stuff we could explore. We really want to build this game with our community. Part of us wanting to get it into the players' hands as soon as possible is for them to help us feel out, hey, what do we want? How do we make the best game for you? We're hoping to have a really close connection there.</p>
<p><strong>What about monetization?</strong></p>
<p>The plan is to be a premium game. It's not free to play; it's not subscription-based. It'll be premium. We're not in a rush to unravel a huge microtransaction plan from the very beginning. We're going to take it a little bit slow. We're not going to be selling anything that is content, so no dungeons, progression features, heroes, or anything like that.</p>
<p>We want to work with our community to understand, if you love this game, what makes sense for you all to spend money on so we can keep making this. The obvious stuff at the top of our list is skins, mounts, and little pets that follow you around.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're intentionally going to double down on PVE coop. Not doing PVP allows us a lot more creative freedom and balancing. It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Will there be any cosmetic customization of the heroes?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have a mirror behind the tree. This is just turned off right now, but of course, we will allow you to cosmetically change the way you look, which will probably be things you can get through microtransactions, but also, of course, the things that you're actually collecting, like the dungeon loot and all of that. We talked about hairstyles and stuff like that. I think there's more to explore there, but nothing final yet.</p>
<p><strong>Would you add a dueling feature to Fellowship?</strong></p>

It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.</p>
<p><strong>What about asymmetrical PvP, like doing simultaneous runs of the same dungeons to see who completes it first?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that kind of stuff, we're super interested in. We've talked about maybe a ghost mode where you can play even asymmetrically offline against other people's runs.</p>
<p>We talked about a live Tournament mode thing. We've talked about special game modes where you might be in the same map racing towards a boss. There's lots of cool stuff that we might do.</p>
<p><strong>What about launching on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>I'd say that's definitely very intimately connected to the gamepad support. So yeah, first, we would implement gamepad support. We don't have a date for when we would explore that, but we would do that first and then look at consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Would you add story-based content to Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>That's a really good example that I consider not something that we would do unless the community clearly shows that that's what they would like.</p>
<p>If the community is like, hey, we really want a story adventure that focuses on letting us know more about our heroes, then cool, but initially, we're just really focused on the dungeon loop.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What about larger group content, like raids?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. When we had our Closed Alpha in August, we forgot to remove the raids tab from our mission table. We're talking about raids. I think it is a natural step. It's the same there, though. It's not something that we're going to roll out from the very start. It's, I would say, one of the features that we're eyeing very intently.</p>
<p>But again, for the health of Fellowship in regards to balancing, I think it's really good to start with getting the 4-player format of dungeons out into the player's hands in the wild for a while so that we can make sure that we get all of the balancing and tuning knobs right and the progression systems starting to add those before we increase the complexity.</p>
<p>Increasing the amount of players you bring to a raid, maybe it's 8 players, maybe it's 12 - we want to do something a little bit smaller than the classical huge 40-man things because they're a mess to manage. But there's some added complexity even for 8 to 12 players, so I think it's healthy for us to make sure that we're delivering top-notch 4-player content before we get into that.</p>
<p><strong>Will you add a guild system, too?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a pretty natural connection. There's nothing planned at launch, but we're going to listen to our community and figure out what kind of social tools they want. The way we approach what happens after early access is that we have a lot of ideas. We also have a lot of designs pretty fleshed out for various features. We've talked about raids, we've talked about guilds, there's a whole bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>I think it's important to have some kind of discourse with the community about exactly how we want to roll that out rather than us making up the next couple of years of features and then being kind of stuck delivering on that, and maybe after two weeks the players are saying we want something else. So, we're keeping things open. We really want to do this together with the community.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
