The shop updates with new items as you increase your player level, and that includes new characters. <strong>Every unlockable fighter should be in the shop once you’ve reached Player Level 20</strong>.</p><p>One of the quickest ways to increase your player level is to wish for it when using a Shenron summon. This boosted me up to level 8 and updated the Shop quite a bit. You can also wish this with a Super Shenron Summon for an even bigger boost, but there’s arguably a better use for that dragon that I’ll be going over soon.</p><p>I also want to reiterate that although you can just buy them all in the shop, there’s always an alternative. Aside from the eventual DLC characters and Goku (Mini), the latter of whom is exclusive to the pre-order pack, you can unlock everyone through other means.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-recommend-id="image://3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-recommend-id="image://3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you don’t want to grind out money for the shop, your next best option is to unlock them through the Episode Battles. That’s right,<strong> you can acquire a bunch of these fighters for free just by playing through <em>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</em>’s version of story mode.</strong><br></p><p>This is certainly the most efficient method to get more characters. You’ll unlock them naturally as you progress through the story, all the while increasing your player level and earning Zeni to use at the shop for even more characters. Unless there’s someone you immediately want to unlock and use, I suggest getting most of your roster this way. It’s better to save your Zeni for any extra Costumes or Ability Items.</p><p>Be prepared to dive into some branching path fights as well. What-if battles have been a hallmark of this series for a long time so of course they’ve returned for this entry. Aside from seeing the creative alternate scenarios, some of them will reward you with a character for completing the episodes.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9b58b9b9bcee20f880a4baa6a1f295ea" data-recommend-id="image://9b58b9b9bcee20f880a4baa6a1f295ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A victory screen showing off that Super Gogeta (Z) has been unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A victory screen showing off that Super Gogeta (Z) has been unlocked." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b58b9b9bcee20f880a4baa6a1f295ea" data-recommend-id="image://9b58b9b9bcee20f880a4baa6a1f295ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A victory screen showing off that Super Gogeta (Z) has been unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Running through Episodes Battles isn’t the only offline mode that will unlock characters. <strong>Completing most of the Offline Tournaments will unlock a character based on their theme.</strong> Here is who you can look forward to:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Beating the World Tournament unlocks Goku (Teen).</li><li>Beating the Cells Games unlocks Cell Jr.</li><li>Beating the Other World Tournament unlocks Super Gogeta (Z).</li><li>Beating the Tournament of Destroyers Unlocks Frost.</li><li>Beating the Tournament of Power unlocks Anilaza.</li><li>Beating the Yamcha Games unlocked Saibaman.</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17997e220c5a948592fea68e23494745" data-recommend-id="image://17997e220c5a948592fea68e23494745" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Yamcha and Whis talking at the end of a Bonus Battle, with a column of reward notifications on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yamcha and Whis talking at the end of a Bonus Battle, with a column of reward notifications on the right side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17997e220c5a948592fea68e23494745" data-recommend-id="image://17997e220c5a948592fea68e23494745" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Yamcha and Whis talking at the end of a Bonus Battle, with a column of reward notifications on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I mentioned the importance of what-if battles earlier, and <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> takes it a step further with Custom Episodes. These allow players to create their own stories with simple dialogue cutscenes and special rules for battles.<br></p><p><strong>There are also a bunch of developer-made Bonus Battles, and quite a few of them will unlock more characters.</strong> Do these to unlock the likes of Caulifa, Future Gohan, and Gogeta (Super). That last one’s especially important if you didn’t pre-order (good for you), and get early unlocks for the character.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="43636e0483f6dfe0b0412cda5703757c" data-recommend-id="image://43636e0483f6dfe0b0412cda5703757c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Various challenges are shown on the Zen-Oh’s Orders page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Various challenges are shown on the Zen-Oh’s Orders page." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43636e0483f6dfe0b0412cda5703757c" data-recommend-id="image://43636e0483f6dfe0b0412cda5703757c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Various challenges are shown on the Zen-Oh’s Orders page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a lot to do while playing <em>Dragon Ball: Sparkling Zero</em>, and nothing proves that more than Zen-Oh’s Orders. This giant list of challenges can be browsed on the main menu, and you’ll unlock plenty of Zeni and Titles from doing all of these. But I bring these up because a handful of characters can also be unlocked by completing them.<br></p><p>If a character is available as a reward, you’ll see an icon of them with the challenge. A majority of them show up as the second reward, for using a character a certain amount of times.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ebf590ac87b53fce098c5e3d103d6d0c" data-recommend-id="image://ebf590ac87b53fce098c5e3d103d6d0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A giant golden dragon offering a choice between two characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant golden dragon offering a choice between two characters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebf590ac87b53fce098c5e3d103d6d0c" data-recommend-id="image://ebf590ac87b53fce098c5e3d103d6d0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A giant golden dragon offering a choice between two characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The last method allows you to unlock two characters early. <strong>When making a wish from Super Shenron, you can choose to unlock Goku Black or Future Zamasu.</strong> Both of these fighters are eventually added to the Shop, but only when you reach a Player Level of 20.<br></p><p>Considering how long that can take, no one would blame you if you used a Super Shenron wish for one of these characters. You could also wish for a million Zeni that can then be used towards buying more characters! Another potential wish is to increase player level, which will take you pretty close to level 20. The choice is yours, and depends on how far along you are.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> Previews Suggest That We Are So Back, Y’all</a></span></p><hr><p>Although I wish it was all better explained or at least hinted at, I think spreading out character unlocks is a great motivator for exploring <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746">every aspect that people love about it</a></span>.

That can only mean one thing: It’s October, the spookiest month of the year. And soon Halloween will arrive and, as in past years, that means creepy characters, horror icons, and other villainous baddies will be arriving in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1844747650731479348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1844747650731479348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On October 11</a></span>, Epic posted a new trailer for Fortnightmares 2024, showing off some of the new skins, locations, and items that will be a part of this year’s spooky event. Here’s the trailer: </p><p>Some of the characters in the new trailer, which leaked earlier today, had previously been datamined and reported on before the official reveal. For example, we knew Leatherface and Billy The Puppet (from the <em>Saw </em>movies) were coming to <em>Fortnite </em>as Epic had teased them before and leaks had indicated such earlier this month. </p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844654208730943909&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844654208730943909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Scissorhands</a></span> was a surprise. The eponymous star of Tim Burton’s classic 1990 film is seen briefly in the trailer carving some ice, indicating that they will be available to buy and play as in the update. </p><p>Also new this year are the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844643370141979053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844643370141979053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playable chainsaw</a></span>s. These appear to be melee weapons that can also be used as pseudo-vehicles by carving into the ground and scooting around at high speed. The chainsaws will go perfectly with this year’s new Leatherface skin. <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> killer loves a good automated chain with saw blades. </p><p>This trailer also gives us our first real look at three Disney villains appearing in <em>Fortnite</em>: Cruella DeVille, Captain Hook, and Maleficent.

The law comes as questions have arisen in recent years regarding what "ownership" means in a world increasingly dominated by digital products.</p><p>"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," California Assembly member Jacqui Irwin said <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing" rel="nofollow ">in a press release</a>.</p><p>California's law is set to go into effect in 2025, but it appears Steam is getting ahead of it by issuing the disclaimer now. Presumably other digital storefronts for games will follow at some point in the future.</p><p>The new law aims to help consumers better understand how digital licenses operate--but it doesn't prevent companies from yanking access to content people already purchased. For example, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed The Crew from players' libraries</a> after the servers shut down.</p><p>Developers often close servers for older games as player populations fall, but it's less common for games to be removed from libraries entirely.

Directed by Sam Crane and Pinny Grylls, the film follows a duo of struggling actors as they attempt to stage a production of Shakespeare's Hamlet during the middle of the COVID pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">The film consists of nothing but in-game footage from Rockstar's award-winning 2013 classic, and interestingly enough, it's winning awards, too. Grand Theft Hamlet won this year's documentary film competition at <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/festivals/film/archive/" rel="nofollow ">SXSW</a> and has been <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/03/grand-theft-hamlet-review-to-be-or-not-to-be-shot-while-staging-a-shakespeare-classic-1235855879/" rel="nofollow ">praised by critics</a> throughout its film festival run. The 89-minute genre-bending flick is set to arrive on the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mubi-acquires-grand-theft-hamlet-us-global-streaming-1236029112/" rel="nofollow ">Mubi</a> streaming service sometime in 2025.

The UK has just entered its 3rd lockdown and all theatres remain closed. For actors Sam and Mark, the future looks bleak," reads <a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/" rel="nofollow ">the film's official website</a>. "As the pandemic drags on Mark who lives alone is increasingly socially isolated, while Sam is panicking about how he is going to support his family. They channel their midlife frustrations by immersing their avatars in the horrifically violent yet beautifully rendered virtual world of Grand Theft Auto Online. They steal cars and shoot strangers, but also find moments of calm reflection walking through meadows of wildflowers. In one gaming session they stumble across a theatre and have an idea. Why not stage Hamlet inside the game?"</p><p dir="ltr">"[Grand Theft Hamlet is] groundbreaking and necessary--especially at a time when more and more of our lives (even a cultural artefact as ancient as live theatre) move online," the film's creators shared in a statement on its website. "The documentary asks what is this space? How do we use it now and what else is possible inside it? Can we transport this ancient story inside a brand new one? And will it still make sense? The cinematic potential of Los Santos is immediately apparent, with its glittering, mind-blowingly detailed cityscape and surrounding countryside, the ray-traced rendering of light, ever-changing weather systems and intricate sound design."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4383219-goodnightsweetprince.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4383219-goodnightsweetprince.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383219"></a><figcaption>'Wasted'?

GTA 5's in-game cell phone, naturally.</p><p dir="ltr">"By using the in-game phone camera we were able to get intimate close ups and cinematic pans across landscapes--enabling a more cinematic visual language and moments of pathos, emotion, and lyricism to exist within the chaos and violence of this undiscovered country," Crane and Gyllis explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Mubi has not announced a specific release date, though it has confirmed the film will arrive on the streaming platform and in theaters early next year.

        <p>With a worker's co-operative structure that includes a "voice of the gamers"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">two</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> "spiritual successors" were but filthy pretenders, or at best, the thesis and antithesis resulting in this afternoon's triumphant synthesis.* The <em>real</em> Disco Elysium spiritual successor is whatever they're making at Summer Eternal, a just-announced "art collective/RPG studio" founded by a group of, once more with feeling, former Disco Elysium developers.</p>
<p>The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's worker cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The former Disco Elysium devs in question are writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina. They're joined by several other ZA/UM alumni: former principal writer Dora Klindžić, former senior concept artist Anastasia Ivanova, and former graphic designer Michael Oswell. Confirmed as not involved are former Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov, who aren't involved with at least one of the other "spiritual successor" studios either.</p>
<p>Summer Eternal don't have a named game project yet. Rather, they're currently looking "to gather authors, writers, designers who previously worked together on Disco Elysium, as well as new talent, all of us who have yearned to work together on something completely fresh and original, and create a liberating space for us and other veteran RPG developers to finally, after many years, collectively start innovating again in this game space". 
</p><p>
Whatever their eventual RPG project proves to be, Summer Eternal are broadly aiming to do what they feel Disco Elysium did, and smash all precedents to pieces. "I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking," writes Argo Tuulik on <a href="https://summereternal.com/">the studio's site</a> (which, let me tell you, is <em>really hard to read and digest at short notice</em>). "Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that.</p>
<p>"The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged - for five fucking years I've been waiting to put them to use," he continues. "So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind - let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad."
</p>
<p>
The website has a blogpost about how Summer Eternal operate written by Aleksandar Gavrilović, who is also managing director of Gamechuck. It begins by outlining how Summer Eternal will compromise with capitalism's many vultures, while pursuing their own vision for a socialist co-op. "The dream is simple to explain: create games, push boundaries, and reinvest the fruits of our artistic labour back into the creation of more art, the thing we are alive for on this earth," Gavrilović writes. "However, to be able to work on games, these labour intensive works of art, we need capital, in droves. 
</p>
<p>
"On the one hand, private capital (sometimes in the cloak of "patrons of the arts") has been the preferred shortcut to funding the riskier segment of the arts," he continues. "On the other hand, capital will always prioritise profit over sustainability and artistic expression, leading to various budgetary and creative conflicts. Thus, the question of organisation becomes a question of the balance of power in this dangerous dance."</p><p>Long story short: Summer Eternal plan to open a shareholding company on 1st April 2025, which will distribute shares between four entities within the studio - each with the power to call assemblies and vote on policy, and each with its own revenue-share model. The full-time creative team for their first game will get 50% of the shares, "managed equally" among co-op members, rather than distributed individually. Workers who aren't part of the above "creative co-op of full-time workers", such as outsourcers, will get 25% of shares, distributed according to a structure that permits "capital returns by a system of individual capital accounts".  
</p>
<p>
A further 20% of shares will go to a limited liability company for investors: once Summer Eternal's game is released, this LLC will have a revenue-share model, similar to standard publishing contracts. And the final 5% of shares? That'll go to a non-profit organisation that accepts membership from people who buy Summer Eternal's games. This in-house "voice of the gamers" will be able to use its share of revenues "to organise events, support union-work, or whatever their assembly (comprised of all members) decides on", in addition to being able to summon general assemblies with the other three groups to discuss Summer Eternal's direction.
</p>
<p>
In case you missed it, Summer Eternal's founders have had their thunder stolen today by the announcement of two other Disco Elys'um ups - Longdue's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">untitled "psychogeography RPG"</a> and Dark Math's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>. The press release makes bracingly salty mention of this. It suggests that one or both of the other two would-be claimants to the Disco throne are just corporate parasites attempting to cash in on the legacy.</p>
<p>"We must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising 'the next Disco Elysium' are popping up every hour on the hour," it comments. "It's a sure sign that the 5th anniversary of the release of this monumental game is approaching and every corporation wants a piece of the fortune.
</p><p>
"However, often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves, first instrumentalized for press releases and afterwards underpaid, silenced, bullied, sued, abused..."  it goes on. "But it is all of us - the creatives, the workers, the players - who should be holding control over the means of our creation and who should be celebrated on this day."</p>
<p>The part about mistreating creatives may also refer to the bitter battle between ZA/UM studio management and key staff like Kurvitz and writer Helen Hindpere after Disco Elysium's release. Nic has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">a summary for you here</a>. And with that, I am officially calling a moratorium on Disco Elysium spiritual successors until next week at least.</p>

But there is one thing Atlus said was going to be different in this game compared to <em>Persona</em>, and the team was upfront about it leading up to launch: <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134">doesn’t have romance routes for its various relationships</a></span>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,196578,195502" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is <em>mostly</em> true, but now that the game is out, I can tell you that it’s a little more complicated than that. Given how people hate being surprised by romance, whether because they’re forced into a relationship or accidentally stumble into one, you should know <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> does have some romantic storylines that sneak up on you.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For much of its run, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a pretty sexless game. Most of its relationships are platonic and built upon a shared cause, learning its many fantasy cultures, or helping folks through political turmoil. But there’s not a lot of smooching. In fact, I’m having trouble remembering if there are any scenes in <em>Metaphor</em> in which lips are locked. But that doesn’t mean love can’t bloom— whether you like it or not.<br></p><p>There are two follower bonds that gesture toward romantic interest between your protagonist and the woman involved. Junah, the songstress companion you’ll recruit around midway through the game, and Eupha, the summoner who you’ll meet shortly after. Junah’s is mostly flirtatious, whereas Eupha’s has a full-blown confession of love (albeit couched in the lore and culture of her people, the Mustari). To be clear, you don’t have to play into either relationship if that’s not how you want to roleplay. However, Eupha’s story specifically did end in a way that felt more forced, with an interaction between me and her protective brother nudging my protagonist as if there was a budding flame between me and the summoner despite my not leaning into it earlier in the game. Again, I played dumb to the best of my ability, having headcanoned that my hero had been holding a crush for the swordsman Strohl the whole game, but it does seem like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has a relationship in mind, and doesn’t let you outright turn it down. You can still headcanon this as an awkward interaction with her brother who knows Eupha has feelings for you, whether you’ve reciprocated or not. But the implication remains.</p><p>If you don’t want to mess with that at all, you could always just not finish Eupha’s follower bond. This was how many people handled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843"><em>Persona 3</em>’s relationships</a></span> when the original game wouldn’t let you finish any social links with female characters without entering a romantic relationship with them. It’s not as overt as those, but it does harken back to that same weirdness that I thought we’d gotten past. Suppose you wanted to make Eupha or Junah the canon love interest, would it not have been easier to codify it somehow in the story, not shove it into optional relationships that can take a player by surprise? Do with this information what you will, I just didn’t want everyone to be ambushed by an unexpected romance like I was if they didn’t have to be.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The next time you buy a game on Steam, it’ll be clear that you won’t actually be buying the game. A recent update on Steam now shows players that instead of buying a game, all they are purchasing is a license.</p>



<p>“A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam,” the message reads along with a link to Steam’s subscriber agreement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The update comes just after <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California signed a bill into law</a> that requires digital storefronts to clearly state when media being purchased  is only a license to access. The new law applies to all digital works such as music, movies, TV shows, ebooks, and video games.</p>



<p>“As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important,” California Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin said in a release at the time via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>. “I thank the Governor for signing AB 2426, ensuring the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past.”</p>



<p>The law goes into effect in 2025. </p>



<p>As of writing, Steam is the only storefront to show this disclaimer. Neither the Xbox Store, nor PlayStation Store, nor Epic Games Store display this same notice when going to purchase a game from the stores. It’s unclear when that update will come, but it should be expected to happened.</p>



<p>What do you think of Steam telling players that the game they are buying is just a license and doesn’t constitute ownership? Let us know below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

Melee.</h2></div><section><p>In one of his final videos as part of the "Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games" YouTube series, Smash Bros. Masahiro creator offered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2wYKkqhkG0&amp;t=94s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">touching tribute to his friend and former boss Satoru Iwata</a>, who served as Nintendo president from 2002 until his death in 2015.</p><p>"It wouldn't be right to end this channel without touching on this topic," Sakurai wrote on X/Twitter.</p><p>Sakurai, who opened the channel to talk about his experiences developing games, worked with Iwata at HAL Laboratory before the latter moved to Nintendo in 2000 as the head of corporate planning. Sakurai shares several touching memories over the course of the 10 minute video, including their first job interview, how Iwata helped come up with the title of Super Smash Bros., and the last time they saw one another.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light">— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1844695310091841666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While Iwata's management role typically kept him far away from development, he nevertheless played a key role in Smash Bros. Melee's development by contributing his expertise as a programmer and solving numerous bugs. Sakurai also remembers how Iwata came up with the "brothers" part of Super Smash Bros., which was meant to convey that the characters weren't actually fighting, but friends solving a little disagreement.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Mr. Iwata was truly the person who understood me best</p></div><p>Sakurai goes on to recall his shock at Iwata succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi as Nintendo president, calling it "frankly unimaginable" that a comparative outsider should take over what had been a family-owned business for generations after just two years with the company. Nevertheless, he said, Iwata proved to be a major force at Nintendo, contributing numerous ideas such as the Iwata Asks series, the concept of the Nintendo Direct, and more.</p><p>Sakurai finishes by remembering their final drive together, and how they had planned to meet again later that year before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/nintendo-ceo-satoru-iwata-has-passed-away">Iwata suddenly passed away in July</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/mr-iwata-grab-bag-youtube-0-8-36-1728659112340.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Masahiro Sakurai recalls the last time he saw Satoru Iwata. Image source: Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Mr. Iwata was truly the person who understood me best," Sakurai said. "He was full of virtue, relentlessly hardworking, committed to service, and a man who changed the games industry. If I hadn't met Mr. Iwata at the start of my career, I'd probably be off doing something completely different." </p><p>Iwata's influence continues to be felt in games even now, close to a decade after his death. Just this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">Nintendo released Alarmo</a>, an idea that was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-has-a-fascinating-connection-to-late-nintendo-president-satoru-iwata">near and dear to Iwata's heart</a>. An Echoes of Wisdom easter egg also seemingly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/reggie-incredibly-touched-by-apparent-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reference-to-friendship-with-satoru-iwata">paid tribute to his friendship with former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>, </p><p>Sakurai's tribute to Iwata is one of his final videos as he winds down his YouTube channel, which started in 2022 and has 589,000 subscribers. He says that he continues to make games for the time being, but his next project is currently unknown.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/devil-s-terminal-how-we-made-one-mystery-have-many-answers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What are we working on?"><span>What are we working on?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Devil’s Terminal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a mystery coming of age story about a loser teen plagued by a controlling voice. The story takes place at Guidance Spiritual Retreat, a camp that promises to exorcize the problem out of “problem children.” The MC (Main Character) meets four fellow troubled kids, the camp's shady owner, a lively counselor, a quirky medium, and an omniscient computer that promises to guide the MC out of their loserdom.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Soon (like 30 minutes in), it becomes obvious that the camp is not what it seems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was some sort of cult here…</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The computer seems to accurately predict the future….</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The five kids weren’t brought here by accident…</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These are just a bunch of “objective” facts. We wanted the player to decide what those facts mean to them, because, in our opinion, facts never stay “objective” for long.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We made the MC have “filters”—lenses through which they experience the world. Much like in real life, perception shapes the MC’s understanding of reality. This means the challenge now wasn't just tracking what the MC knows, but also how that knowledge is interpreted. This makes our concept uniquely cool to us, and, unfortunately, a unique pain in the ass to write.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is our goal?"><span>What is our goal?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sweet spot between a gripping, guided narrative and an open-feeling structure is an elusive thing that many games never find. We want the best of both: tons of freedom, but every piece of content has to hit hard and feel relevant. We want the player to choose the experience they would want and then give it to them the way they want it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we entered the active writing phase, it became clear that manually tracking the multitude of available facts was insanely hard. The MC keeps uncovering new clues; each clue can be interpreted differently depending on the MC's perspective; the reactions to the same clues can vary for each character; what the MC knows and believes constantly reshapes the paths available to them. Trying to manage all those branches manually wasn’t just impractical, it would also lead to a worse game overall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is where our attempt to design a new Detective System came in. It would help us curate the experience of each player while hiding the puppet strings behind the curtain. The system had three key goals:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Accounting for perspectives:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The same fact will mean different things to different players. The same falling brick can be a result of a curse, an unfortunate accident, or even an attempted murder. We wanted the players to interpret things through different lenses—like skepticism or mysticism. It’s unsatisfying to tell a skeptic that they are up against supernatural demons, and for a mystic, it would suck to learn that their spells are stupid and don’t fit inside a realistic setting. So we let our player pick a lane and then make the story fit them, not the other way around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Structuring the clues:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We had to organize all the facts the MC gathers into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Threads</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—groups of related clues or questions they’re curious about. Then we need to track which facts are known to which character at which point. Every one of those threads needs to fit into each possible theory. You can learn everything there is to know about a person, and then you can decide if what you’ve learned points to them being a lunatic or a prophet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Making writing manageable:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> To keep the writers sane (in reality, it still makes ‘em crazy), we needed a system that would track all available story branches, what the MC has learned, how they decided to view it, and how the arcs of other characters were affected by those choices. When the MC learns something, the player decides how they will view it and who they will tell about it—all that needs to be tracked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let’s look at one example of an “objective” fact and track its transformation throughout the plot. “What is the connection between the camp and the cult that used to be here?” This seems like a good question to start with.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Accounting for perspectives"><span>Accounting for perspectives</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The MC’s perspectives:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Players view facts through different lenses, which then shape the conclusions they draw. This adds flexibility and lets the players mold the story with their own spicy or minty takes. We call these perspectives </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rails</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Occultist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> embraces all things weird, understands the world deeply, and also not at all.

Zero&nbsp;</em>has launched to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' highest Steam player count ever, and it's not even a close call.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco and Spike Chunsoft's latest&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighter launched just yesterday, but at time of writing, it's already hit a Steam player count <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">high of 122,554</a>, and that's with the weekend yet to come.</p>
<p>That's easily enough to dethrone its nearest competitor in the franchise,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>, which has an all-time Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/678950/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">player peak of 44,303</a>. That total is not to be sniffed at, but&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has left it in the dust.</p>

<p>In fact, according to SteamDB,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is currently Bandai Namco's third best-performing game of all time on Steam, second only to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's pretty close between&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>, too, with the latter achieving a peak Steam player count of 129,975 across its entire lifetime. I'm betting that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>beats that total by the time the weekend is through.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>pulls out pretty far in front with almost a million concurrent players, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">staggering popularity</a> of that game, I don't think&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>should feel too worried about its success.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, it's actually the fourth game in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>series, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yakuza-like-dragon">pulling a&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yakuza-like-dragon">Like a Dragon</a>&nbsp;</em>by adopting the Japanese title (since the games were released in Japan under the name&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Sparking!</em>).</p>
<p>The game boasts more than 180 playable characters, "heart-pounding, high-speed 3D battles", and a feature by which you can create your own&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>battles and share them with like-minded fans around the world.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790600/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/9N7XMJJHNFC3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>The Axis Unseen launches on October 22 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-axis-unseen-439821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, and Insider Gaming has an exclusive first look and walkthrough at never-before-seen gameplay.</p>



<p>The gameplay comes from our interview with The Axis Unseen creator Nate Purkeypile. It takes place in a region in the game called “The Darkness” about halfway through the game, and features a couple unique monsters, including one you can only see out of your player’s peripheral vision. It’s also terrifying as it has teeth for eyes.</p>



<p>Check out the gameplay below. You can also check out the full interview for yourself. In the interview, Purkeypile talks about the game’s development, a potential console release, future updates, and more.</p>



<p>A demo for The Axis Unseen is available on Steam.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-the-axis-unseen">About The Axis Unseen</h2>



<p>“The Axis Unseen is a heavy metal horror game,” the game’s description reads. “Hunt nightmarish monsters from ancient folklore in a mysterious open world, collecting their enhanced sense powers and discovering elemental arrows. Beware, the hunter is also the hunted.”</p>



<p>There is also an original heavy metal soundtrack composed by Clifford Meyer of the post-metal bands Red Sparowes and ISIS.</p>



<p>Other features of the game include, per Just Purkey Games:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Arrow Types</strong> – Your bow and arrow keeps you alive. Upgrade your bow or even find different arrow types such as fire, wind controlling or time distorting arrows. Experiment to see all of the different ways the arrows can interact with each other, such as wind arrows making the fire spread faster.</li>



<li><strong>Improve your senses</strong> – Upgrade your senses with the powers of the creatures. See scent particles. Feel the warmth left behind on their tracks. See colors that no human has ever seen.</li>



<li><strong>Uncover the secrets of the hunters</strong> – Find out what happened to the hunters who came before you and what secrets they uncovered by inspecting their journals and drawings. Where did this world come from? How do you stop the creatures from escaping into your world?</li>
</ul>

Check back later to take your own deep dive in the Fat Babies archives.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello dear readers. Chris is out this month for some well-deserved R&amp;R, leaving the pilot's seat open for me to come in and steer the good ship </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/patch-notes-4-strange-scaffold-rejected-a-culture-of-hope-to-resurrect-i-am-your-beast">Patch Notes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Today, we're going to take a strange trip through game development history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was working on a completely unrelated story a couple weeks ago when a source I was speaking with casually asked me "you remember 'Fat Babies,' right?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fat Babies? The name was so outlandish I thought for a moment I was being played. But nope. I dug through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001019024348/http://www.fatbabies.com/">The Internet Archive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and discovered there was indeed a game developer's gossip hub called Fat Babies, and it was incredibly unhinged.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How else could I describe it? Where in 2024 would you find a website where bloggers spilled industry gossip, developers argued viciously on forums, and the site hosts took regular swipes at Democrats? The site appears to have sprung up in late 1999, meaning Game Developer (née Gamasutra) was up and running by that point, but this was an entirely different beast. One part Perez Hilton, one part 4chan, one part job board, this was a site fully of its day and age.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our goal is to be the premier site for gaming gossip," wrote anonymous contributor "FatSlicky," whose real identity is still unknown to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have a number of 'insiders' within the industry who are eagerly reporting back here with their gaming news—everything from slipped release schedules, cancelled projects, budget overruns, internal team conflicts, and key personnel hirings and firings."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tab over to the "musings" section of the site though and you'll see why developers like Playable Worlds co-founder Raph Koster have "bad memories" of Fat Babies. He explained in an email to Game Developer that a site contributor put him in their crosshairs and reached out to his coworkers in search of "dirt," later posting personal attacks about his character. "I got a pile of emails from coworkers saying 'Fatbabies sucks, you’re not like that,' he said highlighting that the site's toxicity didn't represent everyone in the video game business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not hard to dig up other vicious messages shared by the site's operators—some elevated from the forums (which weren't preserved by The Archive), giving us a snapshot of what some of the gossip looked like. The attacks on designers like Ion Storm level designer Stevie Case by contributor "FatMamaCita" feel particularly gross now that she's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/10/stevie-case-vs-the-world-gaming-industry-sexism">told her story</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the sexism that sent her out of the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, for all the bile, Fat Babies was a rare source for developers to hear about the industry from other developers. "We didn't have any way of keeping in touch—there were no subreddits, social media leaks, Linkedin, Blind, any places that insiders could talk or share info anonymously," recalled former Wargaming and Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Scott Hartsman. "There was no such thing as ambient internet information yet."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "rumors" tab is filled with loads of single-sourced rumors, many of which didn't age well. That's because they either turned out to be not true or because they were tinged with drive-by racism. It's also the tab that documented a spree of layoffs at companies like Sierra Online, Electronic Arts, Eidos, etc. There's a good chance that was the only way for some developers to hear about that kind of news—and Hartsman said sometimes it was the only way you'd learn about goings-on at your own employer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine being a worker at Westwood given the chance to see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010910023513/http://fatbabies.com/story_ww-email1.jpg">your boss's emails</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> discussing why they're releasing "junior or weaker members on the team." Access to that kind of information would definitely make the toxicity bearable for some readers, wouldn't it?</span></p><p>Image via Fat Babies. Names blacked out to protect identities.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers like Trevor Stricker of Pixel Disco told me they remember at first thinking Fat Babies was brilliant. "It felt like somebody else saw through the bullshit and publishing [the rumors] felt heroic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But he, like many we spoke with, became disillusioned by the personal attacks on developers. He recalled a piece targeting Visual Concepts founder Greg Thomas that made him see Fat Babies in a different light. "My opinion started to shift, like [the writer] was using his anonymity as a bully pulpit just to denigrate. he just hated on everyone and everything but...why? It was actually a fertile time for the industry. All this guy had to offer was bile."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I admit to speedrunning through Thomas' experience. When I first clicked through Fat Babies, my jaw hit the floor. Old gossip! Trashy blogs! Random asides about Iraq War protestors being paid by Democrats! Tragedy plus time equals comedy, and boy has there been enough time to find the comedy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as I dug the ruins of Fat Babies, I saw all the familiar toxic flaws of the game industry laid bare by those working in it. The low pay, the tales of crunch, the sexism, the racism, the homophobia...it's easy to see what Case meant when she wrote to FatMamaCita "and people wonder why there aren't more chicks in this industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game industry is now much more diverse, much more inclusive, and far more likely to push back against the attitudes you'd find on Fat Babies. Games journalism has become more robust, and our peers at Polygon, IGN, and GameSpot are now as capable of doing in-depth reporting as they are previews and reviews, reducing the need for dive bar gossip.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But progress isn't linear. Minorities in the industry are still well...minorities, with gender and racial parity in pay and employment still a distant dream. Women and LGBTQ developers are still liable to face harassment in and out of the workplace, and companies like Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games are reportedly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-cloud-imperium-enacting-temporary-seven-day-work-mandate-for-star-citizen-devs">making devs work 7 days a week</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Developers spilling workplace gossip and chat logs to put coworkers in the path of an online horde is a phenomenon that's still with us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's plenty of time to lose all the progress we've gained. If we're going to learn anything digging through the ruins of this once-well-trod website, it's that this is a world we could easily return to.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The headlines that matter">Status Report: The headlines that matter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A big thanks to Tom Regan for stepping into our AM news slot while Chris heads abroad.

But games about history are a fantastic way to introduce players to new historical figures and people, and omitting them entirely would be its own kind of erasure. I'm curious to see what the final results will be like.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader">Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-washington-state-is-doing-to-juice-local-game-development">What Washington State is doing to juice local game development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>// </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">So long as the United States Congress deadlocks itself into doing nothing thanks to the filibuster we will not get federal support for the video games industry over here.

			<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination has officially launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, a new title that has been developed by Offworld Industries, who are known for producing the 2020 game Squad. The Starship Troopers game is part of the franchise and takes place within the Starship Troopers movie universe. This title was created in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and Knights Peak. Now, players will get to dive into a familiar world full of horrifying creatures to fight off in exciting and explosive battles. Starship Troopers: Extermination is a 16-player FPS that has finally escaped from Early Access to be launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Epic Games Store, after only previously being available on Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Extermination - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kp46jD26oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-1-0-launches-on-october-11-adding-single-player-mode-and-more/">latest version</a> of the sci-fi title comes with brand-new features, including a solo-play tutorial mode with Casper Van Dien reprising the role of General Rico to accompany you on your journey. This is just chapter one of the solo play tutorial mode, and chapter two of the solo play mode will come in post-launch updates, which help to introduce players to new mechanics in the game.</p>
<p>The Tanker Bug that appears in the game is a direct inspiration from the 1997 movie. This is a new addition, specifically in the 1.0 update, and these Bugs are an armored assault unit in the Arachnid army and are incredibly strong, with the potential to kill you and others on the team in mere seconds. To be able to dispatch it at all, the entire team will need to focus their attention on blasting the Tanker Bug, which is full of holes.</p>
<p>The full-release update of the game also comes with a new ice planet called Boreas, where players will get to explore and kill as many bugs as possible until their hearts are content on an icy cold planet that was hit with a Bug Meteor, which allowed the Arachnid army to set up camp and begin to evolve to survive the extreme winter.</p>
<p>There are other new features in the fully released version of the game, including new Companies, which allow players to build a company of dedicated Troopers, much like General Rico and his Roughnecks. Each Company will enable players to work together on the Galactic Front and complete special Company Operations, which will provide you and the other players in the Company with rewards as well as the power of friendship.</p>
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $49.99.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into the game?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-axis-unseen-review-heavy-metal-elevates-hunting-experience.1007382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/axis-unseen-heavy-metal-elevates-hunting-experience<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is the first indie project by Nate Purkeypile and his studio Just Purkey Games. A veteran game designer who worked on&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="167cdfe5-ff47-41b1-9613-8e5afb7de3c4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-76"><em>Fallout 76</em></a>,&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="50194234-bf65-48d6-8b69-3165aebab8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, and <em>BloodRayne 2</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>he wanted to bring his creative vision to life with a new indie venture. The result was&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, which blends heavy metal, horror, and hunting. After experiencing the unknown world, I can thoroughly say that <i>The Axis Unseen</i>&nbsp;is a knockout indie entry in gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Experience a New Kind of Hunt in&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em></h2>
<p>The main premise of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is you're a hunter following in the footsteps of those who came before you. Hunt down creatures and collect journal entries to learn about hunters and the world around you as you journey toward the Mountain. A world between worlds, this unknown place is not where you originally came from, and the Mountain is the way back to the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me around 25 hours to complete my first playthrough where I gathered all the powers, magic, and arrow types. I played on average difficulty, but you can choose harder ones, even permadeath. Once you make it through the Portal at the top of the Mountain, you can embark on new game+, start a new playthrough, or keep playing the game to earn different achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-elusive-greenman.jpg?itok=-YUVTab0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-elusive-greenman.jpg?itok=XaNzRcqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The creatures you hunt aren't your ordinary deer, quail, or bear, however. They're what legends are often told of. Cryptids and beasts from folklore that somehow slipped into our world from this place. This is where a chunk of the horror present in the game comes into play.</p>
<p>Not only are these creatures startling in appearance, with giant bone growths or lacking skin, but they also make incredibly creepy sounds. There are creatures so large they shake the earth when they walk, while others scream if you get too close to them. Even during the day, these can ambush you with fatal consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While your prey may be scary to look at or hear, the world of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is filled with giant human skeletons, horned creature skeletons, and an abyss filled with fleshy tissue. Everywhere you look there are bones, altars, and abandoned structures. It sets the scene for all the tension that builds as you hunt, and are hunted, across the regions.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-giant-skeletons.jpg?itok=RQfJO0bV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-giant-skeletons.jpg?itok=Cd-udmwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Heavy Metal Instrumentals&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Throughout the game, the music enhances all encounters. The Forest is melancholic, the Darkness puts you on edge. Like other titles, the music changes as you encounter stronger enemies. What makes it the perfect fit for&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen&nbsp;</em>is the genre of music, metal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it was classical or electronic, the music wouldn't fit as well. It wouldn't enhance all interactions in the game like metal does. Entering a new region brings new music. Combined with creature sounds, new visuals, and potential attacks, it heightens the tension substantially. At one point, the music had amped me up so much that I almost jumped off my chair when I got attacked by a new creature.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-goatman-huay-chivo.jpg?itok=o1NZPjpd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-goatman-huay-chivo.jpg?itok=F6Nhl0Te 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The genius behind the heavy metal is&nbsp;Clifford Meyer, a former member of&nbsp;Red Sparowes. His band experience and musical talent allowed him to craft instrumental music that elicits a variety of emotions from triumph to sadness to fury. Without this aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, it wouldn't be as fun to play as it currently is.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It's Not All Hunting Trophies</h2>
<p>There are a lot of good things about&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, but there are a couple of issues with the game as well. While there's an intricate story laced throughout the game, it involves finding the scattered journal pages. This isn't necessarily hard since most are found near Portals, magic altars, or energy hotspots. The real downside is the pages and pages of reading you have to do to learn about the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I don't mind reading a bit of lore to understand a story. However, it's about 150 pages of reading that you need to go through to get the big picture. On top of having to read a lot of words, you can be attacked while getting through the journal entries. Unless you're sure there are no creatures around, learning lore can be a bottom-of-the-list task.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-journal-entry-darkness.jpg?itok=sP4_CnxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-journal-entry-darkness.jpg?itok=xBTwWXDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition to large-scale reading, there are some areas you can fall through the map. Don't jump off any ledges, as you may get stuck at the bottom of a cliff and have to end your hunt, sacrificing any unlocked energy you've collected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, an arrow type you're looking for gets skipped over when changing arrows. This can disrupt your timing for explosions, getting in a kill, or being able to see in the dark. This is a minor inconvenience and doesn't happen all the time, but often enough that it should be mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is a solid solo game produced by&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile. It combines horror, hunting and shooting, with heavy metal music to carve out a place among competing titles. For players looking for something new, want to experience their favorite music genre in a different way, or just want to check out a great indie title,&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;should be on the list.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-disco-elysium-devs-reveal-two-new-studios-and-spiritual-successors.1007379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers have announced two brand new studios and two spiritual successors to the influential RPG within just a day or so of each other. Feel free to make your own "weird that it happened twice" joke here.</p>
<p>The first new studio to make its announcement (in our running order, not necessarily chronologically) is Dark Math Games, which describes itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>".</p>
<p>The team is based in the UK and boasts a staff of 20, "about half of whom contributed to bringing the critically acclaimed hit&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>...to life", according to a press release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-new-studios-spiritual-successor-xxx-nightshift.jpg?itok=rAR4RCPA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-new-studios-spiritual-successor-xxx-nightshift.jpg?itok=VOxJ99yn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>is one of the two&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>spiritual successors revealed today.</figcaption></figure><p>Dark Math's debut game is&nbsp;<em>XXX Nightshift</em>, a slightly questionably-named narrative RPG in which you are "stranded at a luxury ski resort in Antarctica".&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you play, you'll experience "deep single-player role-playing", complete with an "innovative and powerful role-playing system" that "respects your time and trusts your intelligence with seismic choices". Sounds pretty&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>-esque, alright.</p>
<p>Somewhat cheekily, Dark Math also promises&nbsp;<em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>will bring "a few less words" and "a few more bullets" to the RPG table, resulting in a "lot more fun".&nbsp;It's probably fair to say there was a lot of reading involved in enjoying&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>
<p><em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date or window yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to follow along with its progress.</p>

<p>Next up on the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor conveyor belt is Longdue, a new studio that boasts a dozen staff members "including team members that worked on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>and its unreleased sequel".</p>
<p>Longdue is also pulling in talent from the likes of Bungie and Rockstar for its debut title, which it describes as a "psychological RPG" which "explores the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious".</p>
<p>Unlike Dark Math's game, Longdue's debut project doesn't have a name yet, but you can keep an eye on its progress by heading over to the studio's <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official website</a>.</p>
<p>In total, this makes four companies arguably vying for the legacy of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. As well as the two studios above, there's also Red Info, a studio supposedly founded by ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>leads Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov, although we haven't heard much about that studio for a while.</p>
<p>Of course, original&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM is also technically still a going concern, although it did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">cancel a project and lay off some of its staff</a> earlier this year. Which of these studios will emerge victorious in the battle for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s soul? We shall have to wait and see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/us-video-game-hardware-sales-fell-drastically-in-august-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It looks like people have the game hardware they want or need right now. According to the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l6ahdhuslg2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, US video game hardware sales saw a drastic year-over-year decline in August 2024.</p>



<p>Per the sales data, hardware spending fell from roughly $325 million to $208 million. That’s a 36% drop year-over-year. It was also added that each current-generation console had at least a 34% fall in sales compared to August 2023. The Nintendo Switch had the furthest fall at 41%.</p>







<p>While steep, the drop in sales shouldn’t be surprising. The current-generation Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles are almost four years old, and most players who would buy them already have them. The Nintendo Switch is over seven years old and is set to be replaced, so the near 50% year-over-year fall is somewhat expected.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro launch should see a jump in sales later this year, but it won’t move the needle all too much with its $700 price point. The holiday shopping season will also see an uptick in sales in some way.</p>



<p>Sticking with cost, money likely plays a large factor in hardware sales. With basic goods and services more expensive now than ever before, spending money on things like video game consoles and other hardware can take a backseat on the priority list. </p>



<p>Also falling in August, but not nearly as much, were accessory sales as they fell 3% to $173 million.</p>



<p>“Growth in the Remote Play Device segment (PlayStation Portal), was offset by a 10% year-on-year decline in Gamepad spending,” Mat Piscatella of Circana said.</p>



<p>What do you make of video game hardware sales falling so much year-over-year? Let us know below or in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

The developers describe the actions as such, with you playing as Art, who "disrupts movie sets where films about his own gruesome acts are being shot.

She was 90.</p><p>The new was announced by Oyama's agency and circulated on X/Twitter. Oyama had been living in a retirement home since 2016 and reportedly suffered from dementia. She died on September 29.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Nobuyo Ōyama and Noriko Ohara.</p><p>Born 1 year, 11 months, 2 weeks, and 16 days apart, died less than a year, 2 months, 11 weeks, and 2 days apart.</p><p>Close friends until they physically couldn't during their lives anymore.</p><p>Doraemon and Nobita for 25 years straight.</p><p>Rest in peace. <a href="https://t.co/hQ2IYAT4Aq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hQ2IYAT4Aq</a></p></div>— Daily Pictures of Doramula (R.I.P Nobuyo Ōyama) (@DailyDoramiPics) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyDoramiPics/status/1844660677144654057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Prior to her retirement, Oyama had been best-known for her role as Doraemon, the robotic cat from the future who is often seen as being right up there with Astro Boy as one of the foundational characters of modern anime. Oyama voiced Doraemon for an incredible 2,338 episodes over the course of more than 25 years before finally handing the role to Wasabi Mizuta for a new show that began in 2005. She also had a starring role in the iconic 1970s mecha anime Zambot 3, where she played the hero Jin Kappei.</p><p>After Doraemon, Oyama took on a new role: Monokuma, the villainous mascot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc">Danganronpa</a>, a "walking, talking, psychopathic bear." The series developed a devoted cult fanbase in the U.S. and Japan, and Oyama continued in the role for several games before her retirement in 2015.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nobuyo Õyama, the Japanese voice actress for Doraemon in the "Doraemon" (1979) series, has been confirmed to have passed away at 90 years old.<br>She passed away back on September 29th.<br>Rest in peace.

          <p>After a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-orders-google-to-distribute-third-party-app-stores-on-google-play/">US court ruled earlier this week</a> that Google must open its Play Store to allow for third-party app stores and alternative payment options, Microsoft is moving quickly to slide into this slightly ajar door.</p>
<p>Sarah Bond, president of Xbox, <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255?t=SrOvyzBRyQLwuWk9wn58hw&amp;s=19">posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a> Thursday evening that the ruling "will allow more choice and flexibility." "Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android," Bond wrote.</p>
<p>Because the court order requires Google to stop forcing apps to use its own billing system and allow for third-party app stores inside Google Play itself, Microsoft now intends to offer Xbox games directly through its app. Most games will likely not run directly on Android, but a revamped Xbox Android app could also directly stream purchased or subscribed games to Android devices.</p>
<p>Until now, buying Xbox games (or most any game) on a mobile device has typically involved either navigating to a web-based store in a browser—while avoiding attempts by the phone to open a store's official app—or simply using a different device entirely to buy the game, then playing or streaming it on the phone.</p>
