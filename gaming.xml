		<p>It feels weird to not have the Olympics buzzing on my TV, much like the cicadas buzzing outside. (The cicadas, meanwhile, have not left yet.) In fact, Rob and I were so distraught over the endless sports being over that we decided to record a podcast waxing nostalgic over and event that literally concluded over the weekend. Alas. We do plan to watch the paralympicsthis month, so if you have recommendations on athletes to keep track of, events that are particularly interesting, let us know! (P.S. We are aware we've been pretty sports-centric recently.)</p><p>-pk, who cannot f'ing wait for <em>Alien: Romulus</em> later this week</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Rob and I have been watching <em>a lot</em> of Olympics the past two weeks, and supercharged by the way the men's and women's basketball teams finished, we decided to double dip on Sports!. (Yes, we talk a little Caleb Williams, too, but we are <em>really really really really</em> trying to play it cool.)</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We'll record an episode of HOA early with Janet, talking about Janet's office-to-studio transition, and how it's got someone like me considering a similar pivot this year. You'll hear that episode next week, but during the day, <em>Remap</em>'s football geniuses will join forces to check out the new Madden, in which us playing it <em>really really really</em> cool about Caleb Williams will suddenly be thrust into the spotlight, as we try to win with the Bears.) I think we're also going to spin the wheel to determine the next My Turn episode. If Sports! editing gets gone early, Cado will release it on Tuesday, otherwise...</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY:</strong> ...Sports! will be released today. We're ditching the days between release. In the past, we dropped Sports! episodes on the main feed a few days later, timed to the Sunday NFL schedule, but it feels weird. The bonus you get for being a paid sub, like Remap Radio, is the podcast without ads. Cado and Rob will also take to the streams to continue motorsport managing.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>There will, hopefully, be a letter series that drop sometime this week, but as of this writing, I have not responded to Rob's prompt quite yet. Stay tuned, though. In the meantime, we'll be recording a new Remap Radio.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Remap Radio goes live, amidst my push to finish <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>. We're at the endgame now, which opens the door to me finally playing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>in the coming weeks. (I will also be preserving the play-for-30-minutes format for another game in the near future. Taking requests!)</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-deep-dive-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-team-releases-35-minute-%E2%80%98deep-dive%E2%80%99-trailer.951330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-deep-dive-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										<p>GSC Game World has just given fans worldwide the best look at Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong>. In an extended 35-minute walkthrough, the team guides players through various elements of this post-apocalyptic FPS title, which has been developing for over a decade. Outside of the recent leaks that showcased several minutes of rough gameplay, this is the longest and strongest look we’ve had at Stalker 2 since it was announced more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>Recently, the team at GSC Game World revealed yet another delay for the highly anticipated open-world game. In an announcement that went hand-in-hand with a tongue-in-cheek trailer poking fun at all the postponements, it was revealed that the launch of Stalker 2 will be pushed back two months to November 20, 2024.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Everything You’d Want to Know</h2>
<p>Stalker 2 has been coming for a long time, but there’s still a little longer to wait. If it runs well on launch, it’ll be a very well-received game, as some trends have surfaced this year, such as the rampant popularity of the Fallout television series, that have left gamers worldwide <strong>hungry&nbsp;</strong>for a solid post-apocalyptic adventure. Given that it has been several years since the last major Stalker release, it’ll also be a boon for fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>Several key details have been revealed in the massive gameplay walkthrough published today by GSC Game World:</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl - Developer Deep Dive" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRLJ3lV-_V8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, it’s stressed just how wide, open, and diverse ‘The Zone’ will be in Heart of Chornobyl. It’s a staggering world that features&nbsp;<strong>twenty regions</strong>, each of which offers unique elements that encourage open exploration. With that being said, the team has constructed the game from the ground up to give a sense of loneliness and apprehension as the player explores, fully unaware of what might be lingering around the corner.</p>
<p>Despite Stalker 2 being a solid competitor to games like Fallout, there’s no ‘traditional’ levelling system in the game, which restricts the more RPG-focused elements some players might have been hoping for. It’s still Stalker at heart, though – and that means that you’ll still have those survival elements and some resource management to handle.</p>
<p>For instance, you need to manage your inventory to ensure you’re not carrying too much weight. Instead of a typical levelling system, Stalker 2 will unfold like Metro Exodus, with the player needing to explore and dig in all the game’s nooks and crannies to unlock attachments, weapons, equipment, and upgrades.</p>
<p>With a dynamic faction system, a whole host of nasties to battle, a massive open-world map, and countless opportunities to take on side quests and other assorted missions, Stalker 2 looks like the kind of game that you’ll pour&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>upon&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>into.</p>

                <p>Nacon's upcoming Terminator game, Terminator: Survivors, will potentially bring the future war to life in a way that gamers have never seen before. But Judgment Day is going to have to wait. Nacon has announced that the game has been pushed back from its PC release date on October 24. Instead, both the PC and console versions of Terminator: Survivors will now be released in 2025.</p><p>Marco Ponte, Nacom's CEO and creative director, released a statement online that explains why the studio felt it needed more time to work on the game.</p><p>"This deferral of the game's release was a tough decision to make, however we believe that this additional time will enable us to ensure that our vision of the post-apocalyptic world of Terminator meets the expected level of quality," said Ponte. "On behalf of the Nacon Studio Milan team, I would like to thank all the players and fans of the franchise for their enthusiastic reception of Terminator: Survivors. We are extremely proud to have this opportunity to work on such an iconic franchise as Terminator, and are eager to reveal more of it to you. Thank you all for support… We’ll be back."</p><p>While the Terminator continuity has been mangled by the last two movies in the franchise, Terminator: Survivors is taking its cues from the first two films. The title is an open-world game set four years after Judgment Day, as humanity is still scrambling after Skynet's attempt to wipe them out. Gamers can play solo or join other players in co-op as they look for resources to build a base and mount an offensive against the machines.</p><p>Naturally, Skynet won't be taking that lying down, and numerous Terminators from the films will be featured in the game.</p>

            <p>
Terminator: Survivors, the open-world Terminator game from Rims Racing developer Nacon Studio Milan, has been delayed, with publisher Nacon having opted to move its previously announced Steam early access launch from this October until sometime in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Terminator: Survivors was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terminator-resistance-developer-making-new-robocop-game">teased</a> back in 2022, but it wasn't until this February that Nacon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nacons-open-world-terminator-survivors-heading-to-steam-early-access-in-october">gave it a name</a> and shared first details. It sees players, cast as the titular survivors of humanity's near-extinction on Judgment Day, attempting to "reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating... the last vestiges of mankind."
</p>
<p>

More specifically, players - either working solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - must roam Terminator: Survivors' hazardous post-apocalyptic open-world in search of materials, resources, information, and other survivors as they set about establishing a base of operations - all while fending off Skynet's machines and rival factions hunting for the same resources.

<p>
Terminator: Survivors was originally due to launch into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/">Steam early access</a> on 24th October, but Nacon has now <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701">announced a delay</a> on social media. "To realise our vision, and to make sure to deliver the game that fits your expectations," the company wrote, "we need some additional time. Thus we will be pushing the launch to 2025."
</p>
<p>
"We know that this will be a disappointment to many," it continued, "but we want to do right by this universe, its fans, and our community. In the long term we believe this is the right call. We are grateful for your understanding."
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, Terminator: Survivors' Steam early access launch will be followed by a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release "at a later date".

<p>Players will be free to roam the large and realistic open world of the real Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, transformed by the fictional Chernobylite material. They will get to create and develop their own hero, with attributes and skills affecting combat effectiveness and the conversation style.</p>
<p>The developers claim the sequel will feature an advanced melee combat system, in addition to a diverse arsenal of firearms. Stealth or calling on others for help are other options available. Each of the main character's buddies is a potential teacher, ready to share their knowledge and skills. Assemble your team and discover the unique strengths and abilities they bring to the table.</p>
<p>Planewalking allows you to change the build and equipment on the fly. Moreover, players are free to develop more than one character skill set. Base expansion is also important, with players able to craft valuable items and upgrade their weapons every day. Assigning tasks to NPCs ensures they will take care of your equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>Throughout Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, players will fight for influence and negotiate with the game's factions. The Exclusion Zone is a battlefield that changes daily and reacts to your actions.&nbsp; Perhaps the biggest addition is online co-op. Dedicated missions are reportedly embedded in the single player campaign, allowing players to interact with each other in various ways.</p>
<p>We'll keep a close eye on the development of this promising sequel. Stay tuned for more information as the release draws near.</p>

This cooperative action game has to be played with a friend, and you only have to buy it once if you’re playing online, as you can join a friend’s session without owning a copy of the game. It stars two criminals who break out of prison, and the roller coaster ride of cooperative antics doesn’t end there. <em>A Way Out </em>is the kind of co-op game that requires you to communicate, coordinate, and move in a synchronized fashion. Whether it’s climbing back to back through a small space, or one person moving around the world while another talks to an NPC, or playing a game of Connect Four, <em>A Way Out </em>is all about two players working like two arms on one unit, and it makes for a really compelling, sometimes meaningfully frustrating experience to play with a friend.

This means you’ll be navigating gorgeous, sidescrolling environments while also dragging each other across the screen. Sometimes it doesn’t quite feel like it’s made for two people, as it can be completed by swapping back and forth between your two Yarnies, but there’s something special about finishing it alongside a friend, sitting together on the couch for local co-op. <em>Unravel Two </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483_00-COLDWOODPIKE0000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483_00-COLDWOODPIKE0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running for $4.99</a></span> during the remainder of the Summer Sale.<br></p></div><div><p>Berzerk Studio’s <em>Just Shapes &amp; Beats </em>is still a staple at plenty of gaming conventions years after it launched in 2018 because it’s such an easy pick-up-and-play experience to dive into with friends.

Now, not only has the community-driven mode made a ton of progress, but it also has a playable beta that shadow-dropped yesterday. </p><p>Maximilian Dood announced his Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite mod, now minted as Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond, in a <a href="https://youtu.be/wSZeUh5FlWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy YouTube video on his channel</u></a>. In the hour and 46-minute video, Maximilian detailed the mod and its changes in comparison to the game’s original release. </p><p>“The only way you can play other people online with these balance changes is if the other person also has it,” Maximilian said in the video. </p><p>While the mod is still a ways away from being complete, a beta for the game is available to download on <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/534185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameBanana</u></a>. Detailed in the mod’s patch notes are character gameplay changes and a feedback submission form for players to report bugs they encounter. Once the mod is complete, it will be free to download. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There has been alot of confusion of how to install the Balance beta for <a href="https://twitter.com/MVCI_Beyond?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MVCI_Beyond</a> .

Hats off to you and the team for having come thus far already, and thank you for having me aboard!” Moukala wrote in a YouTube comment. “Getting to flex my passion for fighting game music on this project is such a fun experience, and doing so alongside Little V is a hell of an icing on the cake.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@maximiliantiktok/video/7402029798190533918" data-video-id="7402029798190533918"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maximiliantiktok?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@maximiliantiktok" rel="noopener noreferrer">@maximiliantiktok</a> Thank you for coming!

Since starting the project, Maximilian has enlisted the help of Unreal engineer and technical artist <a href="https://x.com/erebuswolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erebus</a> as lead technical developer and Hearthstone proucer Barrett Womack as the mod's creative producer. At the time, Maximilian revealed that the guiding principle for the mod was to attract players "who adduced their eyes" to Capcom's crossover fight. </p><p>“This is the most active game dev I’ve ever done and it isn’t just me. It’s a lot of people. The budget of this project already at three months has well-passed five figures. It’s one of the most expensive things I’ve ever done,” Maximillian said. “This is a mod that is going to be completely free for everybody that bought MvC: I. We have no plan to sell this. We have no plans to turn it into a product in any way. All it’s going to be is that if you like MvC: I, try it out. Our version one should be available at the end of this year.” </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98many-ps1-games-are-almost-impossible-for-us-to-play%E2%80%99.951198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ps1-translation-hilltop-playstation-localization<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There were over 4000 games released on the PS1. That’s a lot of games, but sadly, even today, many of them remain unknown to Western audiences because they were never released outside of Japan. Now, decades later, fans are trying to change that.</p><hr><p><em>The following is excerpted from the book&nbsp;</em>The Console Chronicles, <em>by Lost In Cult. This chapter, </em>Twilight Translations<em>, was written by Brogan Chattin.</em> <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/the-console-chronicles-lost-in-cult?variant=40921043107918" target="_blank">The book is available for preorder now.</a></em></p><hr><p>For English- speaking audiences, the Sony PlayStation had a robust catalogue that offered experiences which its competitors struggled to compete against. It had excellent multi-disc RPGs with epic stories and demanding memory usage that a Nintendo 64 couldn’t rival. It had goofy platformers featuring Gobbos or sentient primates, and high production horror masterpieces that pushed their genre forward.</p><p>Sean Seanson is a Youtuber that covers obscure games and regularly returns to<br>the PlayStation library. Sean’s channel has dozens of hours of PlayStation videos alone, and his enthusiasm for the console is essential to the identity of his work. It’s infectious, whether he’s talking about <em>Incredible Crisis</em> or <em>Gamera 2000</em>.</p><p>Sean explained why the system is so special to him, remarking that “the PlayStation’s library is almost like a bottomless pit of creativity and strange ideas.There are over 4,000 unique games released for the platform which is an absolutely incredible amount when you think about it. And considering how popular and influential this console is, there’s still so much that people don’t know about it.” That is due to myriad factors, such as marketing and business decisions which dissuaded localisation efforts and often kept exciting catalogue titles away from certain regions.</p><p>The relationship between cultural sensitivity and market forces become delicately intertwined when it comes to localising a game for the West. As a result, many PS1 games are almost impossible to play now, simply because they’ve never been translated. If director Bong Joon-Ho was right about film subtitles being an infamous one-inch barrier to a wider appreciation of that medium, the same is perhaps true of games — the effort of localising and then experiencing that video game might just be a mountain for devs and players alike.</p><p>For years, an independent translator named Hilltop has been working on translating Sony titles for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2. They are one of many in a community of modders who translate games that were never localised (and sometimes, some that were). The motivation to take on these sorts of projects often stems from a combination of personal ambition, time, and passion. “I’ve been gaming for as long as I can remember,” Hilltop said. “Most of my earliest memories are about me and my family huddled around an NES playing <em>Mario</em>. I didn’t start doing translations until I found myself unemployed and with a lot of spare time during COVID, though.”</p><p>For Hilltop, what’s most exciting is the opportunity to show people something they’ve never experienced before. “These works may have not found great success at the time, but here in 2023, these games look and feel fresh, and we have a chance to give them a second life by bringing them to a new audience.” Hilltop’s translations include some unique picks. <em>Dr. Slump</em> is an adaptation of an Akira Toriyama manga with beautiful texture work and animation similar to <em>Mega Man Legends</em>. <em>Aconcagua</em> is an impressive cinematic effort that combines adventure game elements with <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Parasite Eve</em> fixed-camera gameplay. <em>Harmful Park</em> is a fun take on the cute-’em-up genre mostly<br>represented in cultural memory by <em>Parodius</em>.</p><p>These games aren’t novelties, though. They represent a large part of the system’s true identity. Playing <em>b.l.u.e. Legend of Water</em> and hearing its music for the first time feels instantly familiar, in an uncanny sense. It’s a deep sea diving game that may not break any barriers, but instead advocates for beauty and aesthetics clearly, making it an essential PlayStation experience.</p><p>One particularly interesting translation in Hilltop's catalogue is <em>Racing Lagoon</em>. This game, published by Square, combines standard role-playing and street racing. Its style and gameplay influences has cultivated a community to this day with people sharing builds on Discord servers. "<em>Racing Lagoon</em> is an absolutely fantastic video game and unique like a gemstone. Yet it was absolutely hammered by reviewers at the time who simply didn't 'get it. They thought a racing RPG was pointless, 'why wouldn't you play <em>Gran Turismo</em> or <em>Final Fantasy</em> instead of this middle ground?' But now that people have finally tasted it, it's almost like a curse. It gave them an itch that nothing else can scratch - <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Gran Turismo</em> simply don't have it," Hilltop said.</p><p>Stories of influence and innovation can be found elsewhere in the canon of translated games too. In 1994, FromSoft made the first<em> King's Field</em> game, an early ancestor to the now-juggernaut Soulsborne genre. This first title was never localised officially, but as of 2006 John David Osborne provided a translation for the PlayStation 1 classic. It's an essential first-person dungeon crawling title if not because of how good it is on its own - for the legacy it carried onwards. Similar translations of classic dungeon crawlers such as the PlayStation versions of <em>Ultima Underworld</em> (translated by Gertius) and Sting Entertainment's <em>Baroque</em> (translated by one Plissken) continue to be workshopped and released. These hard-working translators are adding more PlayStation games for you to experience, unbound by time.</p><p>This sort of work is largely a team effort even when a single person does the majority of the work themselves. Exporters, debug tools, and other programs are essential for many of these projects. Hilltop credits a single document by <em>Policenauts </em>translator Slowbeef as a tool that allowed him to understand the work required for the <em>Dr. Slump</em> project… which was a game full of proprietary encryption algorithms and a whole bunch of other words that make heads spin. Hilltop has also worked with Cargodin before, who translates games and song lyrics on his blog. From SnowyAria to people who have been in the practice for actual decades such as Esperknight there's a rich community of translation personalities. and a history of fan development to explore.</p><p>But why do so many dedicate themselves to the PlayStation? Why any console, for that matter? "Don't get me wrong, I love the PlayStation 1," Hilltop remarked, "I love its games, its music, its aesthetics, the creativity in its burgeoning 3D titles, but it's not cool to like PlayStation, you know? It's almost a given, since it's so ubiquitous. On the other side, you have a lot of people who exclusively work on Nintendo titles because of how much their games have meant to them, and because SNES hacking in particular is friendly territory for a hacker trying to break in".</p><p>Hilltop cites practical reasons for translating any console game. How many tools and retractable footsteps are there for newer hackers? Is there an audience? The latter is a foregone conclusion. People are eager for new experiences and have gone far in supporting Hilltop and other translators in their endeavours. They playtest on real hardware and provide consistent financial support or ongoing feedback. The internet facilitates direct connections between artists and their audience.</p><p>It's a two-way street for Hilltop. "Having an audience I can connect with has helped tremendously. The entire time I've been doing this, I actually did not possess any convenient means to play my translations on real PSI hardware. Being able to reach out for testers has helped keep the patches hardware compatible. And of course, it's incredible to see the vast amount of people who come to these games not just to play them, but to create content and share them on social media."</p><p>This showcase of passion is one of the best ways to communicate the importance of art and preservation. It's easier to care about a game when someone has poured their enthusiasm into it and brought it to you, rather than just stumbling upon said game in isolation. It's like making a playlist for your best friend.</p><p>Sean Seanson's Youtube work embodies this - Sean has both a passion to learn and a passion to show. "So much of what I know about video games is thanks to the great work of writers and video makers, who helped to educate me about the history and wider world of video games. So my videos are a way to both satisfy my own curiosity and have a creative way to help teach others about them, because I think there's a lot we can learn from some of these older games. If they help to inspire creatives or even just give somebody a fun new game to check out, then I feel like I'm at least doing my part."</p><p>Sean, and creators like him, become the gateway for many curious enthusiasts who want to learn more about games history, so perhaps creators also shape the future identity of a console too. "I think when you see how the elements of [PlayStation's] visuals and sound are still popular today (PSX-style horror, PSX D&amp;B/Jungle mixes), its influence on people goes further than just the games. The PlayStation is a vibe, as the kids would say, and I think it's something that will continue to resonate with fans both old and new throughout the years," Sean said.</p><p>These voices also showcase the importance of the internet and less-than-official channels for wider cultural understanding. "[I'd] go to a video game store, or rental place, pick out a game and that was that," Sean explained. "Across certain parts of Europe, Asia, and South America, they were getting games from family members and markets and ending up with all sorts of strange games from across the globe. So games that are maybe quite obscure and unusual to a Western audience might end up being a well-known classic to the kids who got all their games from the local market."</p><p>When a console's identity is only defined by how its parent company advertises it, we become region-locked. We think of Kirby's furrowed brow when we think of the Pink Puffball in the States, but Kirby's demeanour is quite different in Japan. Developers and publishers often decide that elements of their catalogue aren't worth the financial risk in certain parts of the world, or they craft various marketing schemes that change design intent to fit their target audience. There are two forces that ultimately determine a console's identity: the marketing machine and the fans who want to play. Each is deeply informed by the other, but often the gaming industry strives to control the conversation.</p><p>These companies have a financial incentive to dictate the image of the past, or to forget it entirely. This is why community-driven preservation is essential. "Please consider playing [a fan translated game)," Hilltop said as our conversation concluded. "And consider supporting the people creating them. It is no easy task to create a fan translation and they are no lesser than any 'official' work. The pool of games that never left Japan are some of the most interesting relics of the era and absolutely deserve your time and attention."</p><p>When Sony released the PlayStation Classic as a retro revival product in 2018, the game list was wildly different depending on the region. The US PlayStation Classic included the original American release of <em>Revelations: Persona</em>, along with all of its questionable localisation choices. I think of that title when I look at Hilltop's disdain for the word 'official.’ How many official translations of <em>Symphony of the Night</em> exist now? Games are collaborative works, and a translation in any medium requires its own artistic liberties. A console or game's identity has to live beyond the purview of marketing, in the hands of people willing to have a conversation. The very book you're reading in your hands is part of the effort to have this ongoing conversation. Consoles may die in the eyes of their manufacturers, but we ensure that their twilight remains eternal.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
