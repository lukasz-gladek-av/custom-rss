            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/">Delta Force</a> is officially out now for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, after the release date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-this-august-season-break-update-arrives-in-july/">confirmed this past June</a>. As part of the console launch celebration, developer Team Jade has debuted a suite of console-exclusive rewards for players jumping in on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Delta Force | Console Launch - Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hGWaElM2BQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Delta Force arrives with full crossplay support between consoles and PC, though you can opt out of crossplay if you'd rather not play against PC players. </p>



<p>The shooter runs at 60 FPS on both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S devices, though PS5 Pro players will be able to enjoy the game at unspecified higher frame rates later this year through a forthcoming patch. If you want to get a taste of a higher frame rate for Delta Force on your PS5 Pro now though, a press release for the news recommends you disable vertical sync to unlock the game's frame rate.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Delta Force includes console-exclusive rewards. Image credit: Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p>Along with the main multiplayer Warfare and Operations game modes, players will also be able to dive into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-campaign-to-launch-on-february-21/">recently launched</a> Black Hawk Down campaign mode as free DLC for Delta Force.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto played the campaign earlier this year in a hands-on preview</a> ahead of its release, he called it "<em>a drastic shift in both technology and pacing from the multiplayer experience that players might have to take a moment and recognize that they’re getting two distinct gameplay experiences in the same package.</em>"</p>



<p>Now players on consoles can experience the campaign, and everything else Delta Force has to offer alongside PC players.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week.1273827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>developer Team Cherry has teased a major announcement regarding the game, and it's coming in just a couple of days as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media</a>, Team Cherry says that in just 48 hours, a "special announcement" regarding&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be made. I'd wager anything that we'll finally be getting a release date for one of the most hotly-anticipated indie games of all time.</p>

<p>The announcement will take the form of a YouTube video, so that pretty much cements the idea that we're getting a release date; after all, I doubt Team Cherry would make this much of a song and dance just for a fresh look at&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=DbLXeY9R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=oOFuScC_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date could finally be on the cards.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a long, strange road for&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in February 2019</a> (yes, it really has been that long), the followup to 2017's celebrated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>has been in development for a long time.</p>

<p>Each year that went by after&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s initial announcement saw excitement around the game grow, even though&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">release date</a> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">nowhere to be seen</a>.</p>

<p>According to SteamDB's <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is still Steam's most-followed game, clocking up 356,387 followers. By contrast, the platform's second most-followed game is&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, which has 217,811 followers.</p>

<p>Excitement rose again when&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was included as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">summer showcase this year</a>, as well as the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal event back in April</a>, although again, neither presentation brought with it that ever-elusive&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date.</p>




<p>It can't be easy for Team Cherry;&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is easily the most-hyped indie game on the scene right now, and it's hard to imagine anything living up to the astronomical expectations many will have for the platformer.</p>

<p>Still, things are definitely moving forward now, at any rate. We'll almost certainly get to learn when&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is arriving later this week, so stay tuned for more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>And, just like that, we’re back. Welcome once again to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, stories you might have missed, and more. This morning, we have bad news about PlayStation Plus, good news about<em> Helldivers 2,</em> strange news about that PlayDate console, and sad news about the state of video games as brainrot meme games continue to take over everything. But hey, at least that new <em>Conjuring</em> movie looks like it might be pretty good?</p> <h2><strong>A <em>Fortnite</em> clone of <em>Roblox’s</em> <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> is super popular</strong></h2> <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Steal A Brainrot</a></em> has become one of the most popular games on <em>Roblox</em>, leading to kids throwing tantrums when someone…well, steals their brainrot. And now, someone has created a clone that’s become one of the most popular games on <em>Fortnite</em>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-brainrotted-roblox-clone-is-dominating-the-fortnite-charts/1100-6534047/">At one point, as reported by <em>GameSpot</em></a>, the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/island?code=3225-0366-8885"><em>Fortnite</em> knock-off had over 180,000 active players.</a> That would put it in the top five on the Steam charts.</p> <p>And all this popularity has led to a flood of brain-rotting slop. There are clones filling up <em>Fortnite’s</em> creative mode. And if you look around other storefronts and games with user-generated content, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">you’ll see that knockoff brain-rotting games are truly everywhere</a>. It’s totally awesome and not at all horrible that so much of the video game industry is now entirely based around random users chasing the algorithm and exploiting kids playing stuff on their iPad.</p>

 <h2><strong>Eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus in a few weeks</strong></h2> <p>Sony has announced that eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus Extra’s library on September 16. Sadly, one of the games going away is <em>Plucky Squir</em>e, a solid adventure with some impressive visual flair. Here’s the full list:</p> <ul> <li><em>UFC 5&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>The Plucky Squire</em></li> <li><em>Night in the Woods&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Road 96&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Pistol Whip&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir</em></li> <li><em>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Dragon’s Crown Pro</em></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Game Boy emulation is now possible on the PlayDate</strong></h2>   <p>The PlayDate might not be the best-selling console around, but it is one of the coolest. And now the black-and-white handheld with a huge library of exclusive games (and a crank!) can do something very cool: Play original Game Boy games. Of course, not officially. Neither Nintendo nor the people behind the PlayDate are involved.&nbsp; But instead, a small group has created “<a href="https://github.com/CrankBoyHQ/crankboy-app">CrankBoy,” a free, fast, and high-performance Game Boy emulator</a> that works perfectly on the PlayDate and its sharp black-and-white screen.</p> <h2><strong>Some of <em>Halo’s</em> best guns will soon be available in <em>Helldivers 2</em></strong></h2> <p>We knew <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> content was coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em> as part of the game’s leap from PS5 to Xbox later this month. But now,<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-warbond-xbox-launch/"> Xbox has revealed more details about the crossover DLC</a>, and while I’m happy to see the iconic ODST armor arriving in<em> Helldivers 2</em>, the bigger news is that four guns from <em>Halo</em> are coming to the co-op sci-fi shooter, too. This includes the franchise’s famous assault rifle, but more importantly, it includes <em>ODST’s </em>wonderful&nbsp;SOCOM pistol, aka that cool silenced pistol that goes “pip pip pip” and drops Grunts cleanly. I’m hopping back into <em>Helldivers 2</em>, baby.</p> <h2>Valve is adding six new characters to its hero shooter thing known as <em>Deadlock</em></h2> <p>Remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadlock-valve-steam-hero-shooter-moba-release-date-1851631341"><em>Deadlock</em></a>? It was that secret hero-based MOBA-shooter Valve sort of released, but in a weird way. Well, <em>Deadlock</em> continues to grow, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/669466707009471267?l=english">game’s latest update is one of its biggest</a>. It adds a whole new lobby area for players to explore between matches and a new character, a deadly but stylish vampire. Plus, Valve plans to add five new characters to the game over the next few days. Perhaps it’s time I play some more <em>Deadlock</em>?</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-original-heroes-new-characters-2000618254">The devs behind <em>Marvel Rivals</em> might start adding original characters</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-2000618215">No,<em> God of War</em>‘s director didn’t tease a new game; it was all a hoax</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-servers-150-players-100-songs-seasons-summer-2000618257"><em>Skate 4</em> will support 150 players all skating at once</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Incredible Demo Scene - Making Art with Code" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIQ74_DRWEM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

We’re actually getting an update on </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>, the long-awaited sequel that has gone so long without an update that the act of anticipating it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219"><span>has become a meme</span></a><span> almost as common as making </span><i><span>Half-Life 3 </span></i><span>jokes in the chat section of every industry livestream. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>may appear at today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-gamescom-2025-livestream-what-time-fallout-black-ops-7-2000618270"><span>Gamescom showcase</span></a><span>, but it looks like developer Team Cherry also has something else to share on Thursday.</span></p> <p><span>The studio has scheduled a YouTube video to go up on Thursday, August 21, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time titled “Special Announcement.” There’s really nothing else to go on here beyond a logo and a chat log of people already excitedly waiting for whatever the video is. However, given that the game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rog-ally-gamescom-demo-1851787121"><span>playable at Gamescom</span></a><span>, there’s enough reason to be cautiously optimistic that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is finally, after all this time, imminent, and coming to a console near you. Here’s the scheduled video if you want to save it for Thursday, or just hang out with the rest of the sickos waiting in the chat.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong </span></i><span>was first announced in 2019, just two years after the original game launched in 2017. Since then, the game’s absence from any and every video game showcase has been felt so deeply that hoping and praying for its arrival has become an ongoing joke for the series’ fans, as well as passersby who loved to clown on fans every time the game didn’t show up. Now, it seems, the drought is finally over. Hopefully, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is coming soon. If it is, you’ll be able to play it just about anywhere, as the game is coming to both current and last-gen consoles, as well as PC, Mac, and Linux devices. Strap in, folks. After six years of waiting, the ride is about to begin.</span></p>

takes all the core features of the headset's standard model and gives it a Gengar-themed makeover with a new multi-tone purple color scheme and ornate Gengar ear pieces on top of the headband, and RGB-lit rings and Gengar decals on the outside of the earcups. The RGB lighting elements support Razer Chroma desktop app, so you can change the color and program them to react to gameplay.</p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Like other models of the headset, the Kraken Kitty V2 Gengar Edition uses Razer's proprietary TriForce 40mm audio drivers and HyperClear Cardioid mic. It also supports 7.1 virtual surround sound on PC (requires Windows 10 or higher). The headband and earcups use hybrid fabric and leatherette cushioning, which provides some passive noise isolation for a more immersive listen. While Windows PC users will get the most feature support, it can be connected via wired USB-A to other devices as well, including consoles, Mac computers, and more. That means Switch and Switch 2 users looking to pick up the headset ahead of Pokemon Legends: Z-A will be able to plug into their consoles while in docked mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The Razer Kraken Kitty V2 Gengar Edition headset is dropping just a few weeks after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-pokemon-limited-edition-gaming-keyboard-mouse-headset-revealed/1100-6533218/" data-ref-id="1100-6533218">Razer's Pokemon Collection</a> that launched last month.

                <p>Apologies to fans of the series who have been playing it since the very first game, but next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil/" data-ref-id="5000-1727">Resident Evil</a> turns 30. The first game came out all the way back in 1996, on March 22 to be precise, with many games having been released in the meantime. There's obviously a new game releasing next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but it seems that aside from putting out a new entry, Capcom is also planning … something for the series' 30th anniversary. A <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/30th.html" rel="nofollow ">new anniversary website</a> is now available for you to peruse, only right now there's not much to look at.</p><p dir="ltr">At the top of the site is a beautiful piece of art showcasing the game's numerous protagonists, like Leon Kennedy, Claire and Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Ada Wong, and Resident Evil Requiem's main character Grace Ashcroft.</p>

There's also a drawing of a raccoon wearing sunglasses also commemorating the 30th anniversary, in front of a spinning disc that says, "coming soon … " on it.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that Resident Evil Requiem is due out February 27 next year, you probably shouldn't expect a big new game announcement, but some appropriately themed merchandise does seem likely at the very least.

            <p>Nintendo has unveiled Kirby Air Riders in a new Direct presentation, following a brief trailer back in April. The game is set for release on 20th November this year on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation was classic Masahiro Sakurai, creator of both the Kirby and Smash Bros. series. At 45 minutes long, it was an extensive look at what appears to be quite a simplistic racing game, bringing to mind those old Smash Bros. Ultimate character reveals spending forever detailing every move. And with a familiar structure and graphic design, it felt like an extension of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-is-ending-his-acclaimed-youtube-series-this-month">game design YouTube channel</a> he's been running the past few years.</p>
<p>"Why is making a game so hard?", Sakurai amusingly questioned at the beginning of the Direct, later declaring "This game is quite fun!" while playing, as if surprised by his own handiwork.</p>

<p>As for the game itself, it's a follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> - a racing spin-off for the titular character that released on GameCube over 20 years ago - and sees players riding on magical stars around courses, sucking up enemies for special abilities, and speed boosting around colourful courses.</p>
<p>But no, it's nothing like Mario Kart. Sakurai said so!</p>
<p>What makes the game different is the simplicity of the controls - just like the previous game, only one button is used. Acceleration is automatic, meaning the stick is used purely for steering, while a single button is used to brake before releasing for a speed boost - that's how you drift around corners. Get close enough to enemies and the same button is used for sucking up their abilities and attacking them.</p><p>There are a number of tweaks for this follow-up, though. Firstly a second button has been introduced, though this is used purely for initiating unique special abilities. Secondly, as the "Riders" in the title suggests, players can this time race as a number of different characters from across the Kirby universe - not just differently coloured Kirbys - each with their own attributes. That includes the likes of King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, and Chef Kawasaki. Special abilities range from speed boosts to extravagant attacks.</p>
<p>Players can also select from a wide variety of star vehicles to race on, some hovering and some with wheels. Again, each has different forms and traits, with alternative acceleration techniques as well as speed and handling. These combine with characters for combined stats. How very... Mario Kart.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Sakurai remains as charming and meticulous as ever | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Air Ride is the main mode and sees six racers competing around courses. These range from the floral Floria Fields, to the cavernous Cavernous Corners, and the cybernetic Cyberion Highway. Players collect stars to boost their speed, which can be hoovered up in opponents' slipstreams or gained by defeating enemies. A number of options will allow players to customise the format, including the number of laps and even the game speed.</p><p>The main event, though, will be City Trial. This pseudo battle royale mode returns from the original, but is now playable with 16 players online (local wireless play will support only eight players, but another eight CPU can be added). In this mode, players explore an open map - it's called Skyah - for five minutes to collect as many stat-boosting buffs as possible. These are gathered around the map, as are various machines to ride on, as well as specific events like racing, battles, and defeating bosses.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then players enter stadiums to compete in minigames, based on the stats buffed in the previous stage. These are a bit like the Smash Bros. stadiums, with minigames including flying as far as you can off a ramp, racing in a straight line to the finish, or gaining top points flying through targets. Players will be given four stadiums to choose from, with Sakurai suggesting strategy and mind games you can use. Players then advance to their chosen selection, but you can even receive an automatic win if you're the only person to choose a stadium. Fewer players means voting for just one stadium, though this option can be turned off.</p>
<p>In all, Kirby Air Riders looks to offer some fun and flashy racing along with a dynamic exploration mode. "So, did it come through that this isn't just a humorous racing game?" Sakurai asked at the end, seemingly taking a dig at Mario Kart. Whether it addresses criticism of the original game and its overly simplistic gameplay, we don't have long to find out. Until then, check out Kirby Air Riders' theme tune on the Nintendo Music app.</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> "Special Announcement" from developer Team Cherry is planned for Thursday, with the video set to run on YouTube at 3.30pm BST on 21st August.</p>

<p>The news of a "Special Announcement" on Silksong comes after speculation (not unwarranted) that the game would be shown off during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> ONL tonight, with a release date potentially being revealed.</p>
<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier‬ posted on Bluesky to confirm that Silksong would not be having its release date revealed tonight:</p>
<p>"No, Silksong's release date will not be announced today at Gamescom Opening Night Live, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s teasing," read the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4xi2x5c2g">post</a>. That still leaves the window open for a look at Silksong gameplay tonight during ONL, but the big news will be saved for Thursday.</p>

<p>Yep, with the Switch 2 game introducing a whole swathe of Kirby characters to the racer, to make things "fair", now Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Cappy — among many others — will be able to inhale enemies on the course and take their powers.</p>
<p>In Kirby Air Riders, Copy Abilities can be used offensively or to boost your speed. So far, we've seen Fire, Sword, Bomb, Wheel, Mike, Cutter, Jet, Steel Ball, and Plasma, and we're sure many more will be shown off as we approach the game's release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Launching on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>, the box art isn't really anything surprising; it's basically a variation of the main key art we've seen since the initial Switch 2 Direct back in April. Still, it looks lovely! Like most major Nintendo games these days, it's likely there won't be any regional differences for this one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for those looking to purchase the game on the eShop, you can expect it to take up a total of <strong>25GB</strong> on your Switch 2 storage.</p>
<p>As for the price, it'll cost <strong>$69.99</strong> in the US and <strong>£58.99</strong> in the UK. It's not currently known whether the physical edition will be more expensive, but we'll let you know as soon as we can.</p>

			<p>Halo is coming to PlayStation, but not in the way <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">you might have been hoping for</a>, at least for now. A new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/">Helldivers 2 warbond</a> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">game's arrival on Xbox next week</a> brings the look of Halo: ODST to Super Earth's brave Helldivers across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>



<p>If you showed a gamer from 20 years ago the following trailer, where a Halo-related announcement began with the PlayStation Studios logo, they'd be shocked and awed. But in 2025, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded set to arrive on PS5 next week</a>, and several previously Xbox-exclusive titles already on PlayStation, it's far less surprising, but no less fun to see for anyone who remembers what the divide between platforms felt like 20 years ago.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O_9hwQ8jLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The warbond will feature classic Halo weapons like the MA5C Assault Rifle and the M6C/SOCOM Pistol, and the ODST-styled armor set that Halo fans know so well. It'll also feature new capes, armor passive, player banners and a player title.</p>

<p>The warbond will be available the same day that Helldivers 2 arrives on Xbox Series X/S, on August 26, 2025. Which is also the same day that Gears of War: Reloaded will arrive on PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-release-date-set-for-november-tons-of-new-info-revealed.1273776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed a ton of new information about upcoming racing sequel <i>Kirby Air Riders</i>, including when you can expect to play the game.</p>

<p>In a new Nintendo Direct presentation aired earlier today, Nintendo, along with&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>director (and Nintendo legend) Masahiro Sakurai, revealed that&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>will be launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20th.</p>

<p>Along with revealing the release date, Sakurai and Nintendo also divulged lots of new info about&nbsp;<em>Air Riders</em>' gameplay mechanics, characters, and game modes, and it sounds like the game will boast Sakurai's usual maximalist design philosophy (which is definitely a good thing!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=JxorEaKP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=Ng6yfY_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>is launching in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>takes the form of a sort of auto-racer; you won't need to press any buttons to accelerate, but you will need to perform maneuvers to outfox your opponents, use specials to gain advantages, and more.</p>

<p>Each rider has different stats; Kirby, for instance, has a different weight stat to King Dedede, who won't feel the same to play as Meta Knight. You'll need to weigh up which racer you want to use on which course if you want to win.</p>

<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Ride&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll probably recognize the returning City Trial mode, which has been expanded; it now takes place on a massive floating island by the name of Skyah, which is a free-roaming map packed with events to enjoy.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also be able to take part in the game's titular Air Ride mode, which sees you and up to five other riders competing to cross the finish line, as well as other gameplay modes to try out.</p>




<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em>' release in November means it's one of two major Nintendo racing games to be released during the Switch 2's launch window, with the other naturally being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch game&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Today, Nintendo offered a luxurious 45 minutes devoted to its<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo"> cutest pink blob</a> who, when you think about it, is really an eldritch horror of incalculable power. Here are the highlights from the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct.</p><p>Before even getting to the action of <em>Air Riders</em>, we were greeted with a smiling but tired sigh <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch">from director (and Kirby’s dad) Masahiro Sakurai</a>. He explained that he was approached to lead <em>Air Riders</em> while he was working on <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> DLC, and that the new Kirby is a collaboration between his studio Sora and Bandai Namco.</p><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> takes the original GameCube classic and modernizes it for the Switch 2. You can choose many more riders to play as instead of just Kirby including King Dedede, Banana Waddle Dee, and some cool-looking guy I just heard of named Knuckle Joe. The game also supports up to eight players in local wireless play or up to 16 players online.</p><p>And what will you do with those other 15 players? There’s races, point challenges, battle arenas, and good ole’ fashioned exploration. In <em>Air Riders</em> you can choose any number of racing machines, each with their own unique traits, and upgrade them to your hearts content. Is your paper glider machine too fragile? Spend some time exploring, gathering power ups to make it beefier.

              <p>The latest update for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> begins with an apology. Recognizing that communication with players hasn’t been Funcom’s strong suit of late, the developer explains that it’s in part because of “state mandated” vacations.</p> <p>“I apologize if people feel the communication around issues with the game has been lacking,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/515218419125060312">the latest update posted to Steam</a> (thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dune-awakening-promises-an-endgame-overhaul-and-says-communication-has-been-bad-because-developers-had-state-mandated-vacations/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “We are focused on improving this. With a percentage of the team having their well-earned (and state mandated) vacations, customer service and the community team have not always had access to developers who can answer their every question.”</p> <p>If you’ve ever been on a trip to Norway (and Sweden) during July, you’ll have learned the hard way (I speak from experience) that <em>everything is closed</em>. This is a result of <em>fellesferie</em>, the annual summer “common holidays” where just about everyone takes their vacation at the same time. Which is quite mad, but for Norwegians, entirely ordinary. It’s normal for offices to just close down in July, and people who do persist in working during the month will struggle if they rely on suoport from their colleagues. It appears to be <em>fellesferie</em><em>&nbsp;</em>that’s affected&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p>

 <p>Regarding the enforced nature of these vacations, Norway has something called the The Holiday Act, that mandates all employees receive 25 days of vacation a year, meaning it’s even more tricky to prevent an entire team all disappearing off at once.</p> <p>“We’ve been playing whack-a-mole with bugs, cheats and exploits during the July month of summer,” says Funcom. “We’ve banned thousands of cheaters, fixed a bunch of duplication and exploit bugs and continued working on the stability of the game. We’ve been working to achieve a cadence of patches that allows us time to make stable and consistent fixes, while being fast enough to address issues like exploits before they get too far out of control. Live Game development is a blend of reactivity and long term planning.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618409">© Funcom</figcaption></figure> <p>While players have loved <em>Awakening</em>, there’s been a lot of dissatisfaction around what there is to do once the main content is finished. Funcom explains that its Gamescom news is going to be focused on the Chapter 2 Free Update and The Lost Harvest DLC, neither of which will affect the endgame, saying, “this is because Chapter 2 and the DLC were planned and began development before launch.” But, it goes on to list what’s happening in the later stages.</p>

 <p>It seems the big problem facing Funcom, other than an empty office, is that&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> has drawn in what it describes as “very different demographics,” who all want something different from the MMO’s endgame. However, the issues are boiled down to “loss of items/vehicles, players feeling that they are forced into PvP, exploits and cheats, and lack of endgame content/grind.” Arriving soon are the following changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p><b>Improved Player Logging</b>&nbsp;– One of the key frustrations we see is the lack of information and clarity around why certain items/objects/vehicles are gone. We will increase the information in your logs so that you have a better idea of what is going on. For example, listing the names of people who take things from chests in your base.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Vehicle Salvaging System</b>&nbsp;– We’re working on a vehicle salvaging system that will allow you to recover lost vehicles.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Cobalt Paste/Vehicle Inventory&nbsp;</b>– We’re adjusting the volume of the infamous cobalt paste and adding more slots to the Assault Ornithopter vehicle inventory. We will be adding a cargo container that can be carried by the Carrier Ornithopter.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Instanced Deep Desert Loot</b>&nbsp;– The constant camping and queuing of the Deep Desert Testing Stations leads to a frustrating experience where people arrive at an empty Testing Station. We’re going to change these to be more in line with the rest of the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Offline Notifications about important events&nbsp;</b>– We understand that not everybody can or wants to log in to check power/taxes constantly in the game. We would like to create a notification service that sends you the status of your base via email. This one is squarely aimed at you, Ben.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The post then continues with longer-term plans for endgame content:</p> <blockquote> <p>As we’ve mentioned previously, the Landsraad is supposed to be the endgame activity driver. Currently it does not have the breadth or depth of content or progression to serve that function. As we work towards Chapter 3, we will begin to tie the faction progression of the game to the Landsraad, while also systematically building out the Landsraad with a greater variety of activities across the world.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As a player this means that you can increase your faction rank by completing Landsraad tasks, checking in with your Duke or Baron occasionally to perform special missions and visit faction vendors.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>Landsraad activities will become contract based, rather than delivery based, which will allow us to effectively remove the issue of stockpiling that is currently endemic in the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>This ensures that people are rewarded for solo play (as well as making contributions easier for them to track) and will give you many choices in how you progress over time.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As for the planned activities, we have plenty in mind in addition to the current testing stations and shipwrecks. The following list contains examples, and not promises, as these will take work and time to deliver. But currently we are thinking of things like: Assassinations, Treasure Maps, Races, Construction Challenges, Duels, Faction vs Faction maps, Improved control points, Scavenger Hunts, Temporary Crafting Challenges etc.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>These activities will make use of the Overland Map, spawning in new maps as required. We have always wanted to flesh out the Overland Map over time, and this will boost that along.</p> <p>Of course, we are open to your suggestions so please share with us on social media the kinds of activities you would like to see in the Landsraad.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As the Landsraad activities become more fleshed out, we will then transition the Deep Desert back towards the original intention – a sandbox area where players can compete for control of the spice. We will continue to iterate on the Deep Desert – adding no-fly zones to enforce ground combat, adding more layouts with more variety and challenge, and ensuring that there is clear progression. In addition, we are experimenting with the tech behind the Deep Desert and if things go well, you will experience the Deep Desert in a much more stable environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>This will apparently be the focus for the rest of 2025, now everyone’s back in the office. Before they all take off again for Christmas.</p>

              <p><span>I never really think of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>as a great game for recreating other movies and music videos until I see the lengths some creators go to use Nintendo’s life sim as their movie studio. I’ve been obsessed with Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> for the past month, and several nights a week I’ll find myself scrolling through my feeds looking for reaction videos, covers, and other indulgences to feed my ongoing brainrot. Now, I’ve found an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>channel that is recreating all the movie’s musical numbers in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, and I’m mostly just surprised at the creative solutions they came up with to make up for the game’s lack of fantasy weaponry and demons.</span></p> <p><span>Anyone who’s played </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>knows that it has some pretty robust creative options in terms of outfit design, character customization, and even set creation. Where the challenge lies in recreating something like a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>music video is in finding animations, items, and characters that can at least somewhat emulate things that don’t exist in the game. YouTuber Magic Studios, who has recreated almost every musical moment in the film, has managed to use the tools in </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>to creatively represent actions like demon fighting and skydiving from a busted plane, and, to the best of their ability, tried to capture the film’s choreography.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: What It Sounds Like (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKk9WeRNXxg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of the most clever details will likely hit hardest for people who have both seen the movie and put an exorbitant amount of time into perfecting their </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>island, such as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-tom-nook-is-misunderstood-506751609"><span>money-loving tanuki Tom Nook</span></a><span> representing Gwi-ma, the demon king final boss that the Kpop girl group Huntr/x faces in the finale. My favorite part of these videos, however, is seeing how Magic Studios recreated different costumes for both the main cast and side characters using </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>’ Custom Designs feature. Some videos are more elaborate than others, like the “Golden” music video which faithfully recreates the movie’s pre-performance hype cycle as the girls are promoting the upcoming single.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: GOLDEN (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arDp3X_5lyg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>You can check out all of Magic Studios’ </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> videos </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@magicstudios7112"><span>on their channel</span></a><span>.

Today’s Kirby Air Riders Nintendo Direct was no different, with the legendary game maker jokingly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakurai-says-kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-in-extremely-smash-bros-style-direct"><u>confirming Kirby Air Ride “basically is like Mario Kart.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With both series focusing on racing mechanics and, now, a strong roster of characters, the similarities are hard to deny. That said, as shown during today’s broadcast, it’s clear the Kirby spinoff does more than enough to stand apart as a completely different experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Isn’t the Only Rider With Copy Abilities</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">During the development of Kirby Air Riders, Sakurai and the rest of the team realized it might be unfair for Kirby to be the only character with the option to copy abilities. So, naturally, they decided to let everyone from Meta Knight to King Dedede copy the powers of enemies and even change their appearance for the first time in the series’ history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, we did,” Sakurai said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Up to 16 Players Can Play City Trial at a Time</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Up to 16 players can play City Trial together in Kirby Air Riders. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/kkdA1zDCFA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kkdA1zDCFA</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1957796396762890323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders will allow players to join in groups of 16 when playing its open City Trial mode online. That's a significant increase from the original four-player multiplaer support, with players will able to race around the dense Skyah map, which is said to be quite a bit larger than what fans may be used to and features a variety of different themed areas. Additionally, City Trial supports up to eight players when playing via local wireless support.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Starlit Journey Main Theme Revealed, Out on Nintendo Music Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With so much of today’s Nintendo Direct focused on Kirby Air Riders gameplay, Sakurai still made sure to talk about some of the game’s new music. Specifically, fans were treated to a snippet of the sequel’s main theme, Starlit Journey. It, along with a selection of other Kirby Air Riders tunes, will be made available via the Nintendo Music app later today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">But Wait, There’s More</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With nearly every second of the Kirby Air Riders Nintendo Direct dedicated to showing off something new, it’s no surprise to hear that Sakurai and Bandai Namco have more to talk about. The director closed today’s presentation with the tease that he’d like to talk more about Kirby Air Riders in the future, though it’s unclear if this additional information will arrive in the form of another Nintendo Direct, a blog post, or something else entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the very least, we now know players will get to go hands-on with Kirby Air Riders when PAX West 2025 comes to Seattle later this month. With the release date now only a few months away, we’ll hopefully know more about Nintendo’s plans soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo's big Switch 2 direct back in April revealed a lot of games releasing during the console's launch window, and one of them was Kirby Air Riders, an apparent sequel to the GameCube racer from 2003. Today, Masahiro Sakurai himself walked us through the new game in great detail, showing off its characters, mechanics, modes, and ending with a release date.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4">Watch The Archive Of The Kirby Air Riders Direct Here</a></h3><p>The original Kirby Air Ride's big selling point is its simplicity – everyone plays as Kirby (save for two unlockable cameos), and there's only one button, which you use to drift around corners. It's only natural that the sequel, Kirby Air Riders, would expand on each of these aspects. For starters, you can play as a lot more than just Kirby. Here's the full roster so far:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Kirby</li><li aria-level="1">Meta Knight</li><li aria-level="1">Waddle Dee</li><li aria-level="1">King Deedeedee</li><li aria-level="1">Chef Kawasaki</li><li aria-level="1">Cappy</li><li aria-level="1">Magolor</li><li aria-level="1">Gooey</li><li aria-level="1">Waddle Doo</li><li aria-level="1">Knuckle Joe</li><li aria-level="1">Susie</li><li aria-level="1">Starman</li></ul>










<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b923da88-427e-4753-b4f9-e6a96baafa5d" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

	






</article>
<p>Each character has slight differences. While Kirby is a simple, all-around racer, Meta Knight can glide, King Deedeedee can swing his hammer, and Cappy (the little mushroom, not to be confused with Mario's sentient hat) can use his mushroom cap to avoid taking damage. Each rider is relatively balanced, however. While Kirby was the only one who could copy abilities in the original, now everyone can gain copy abilities from enemies roaming the tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a second button now; when your meter is full, press Y to activate a special move, unique to each character. They unleash an attack and/or speed boost to give you a big advantage right when the moment demands it. It's another incentive to choose a character other than Kirby.</p><p>The two modes detailed are Air Ride, a standard race that now supports up to six players, and City Trial, where players explore an open map to collect power-ups before facing off in the end. City Trial now has a new map, too – the floating island of Skyah, a mishmash of different mini-areas to explore. Up to eight players (on different consoles) can play City Trial locally, but it supports up to 16 online.</p><p>Finally, the showcase ended with a tease of a mysterious new character with an exhaust pipe for an eye. Then, we got a release date: November 20, 2025. Kirby Air Riders will be available just three months from tomorrow, making it one of Nintendo's big holiday games.

<p>Yes, the best mode from the GameCube original is returning for the Switch 2 sequel, and it looks just as high-octane and bonkers as we would have hoped.</p>
<p>The Direct introduced us to Skyah, the new hub world for this mode, which you'll have to speed around to collect and build the best machine that you can. This sandbox area looks substantially bigger than the one we know from the early 2000s, with several different zones like caves, volcanoes, oceans and more.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>With the machine built (and the five-minute time limit up), it's off to the races in the Stadium events, which will put your build through its paces. Much like in the original, these events range from agility tests, to long-jump competitions, so there's something for every build.</p>
<p>This mode is available for up to 16 racers at once, with up to eight players in local co-op.</p>
<p>Honestly, this was how we spent most of our time with Air Ride on the GameCube, so it'll be interesting to see whether bigger really does mean better when this one arrives on Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-collaboration-confirmed-in-latest-warbond.1273704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Xbox have confirmed that the teased&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover is indeed real, and it's taking the form of the game's latest Warbond, which also happens to be its first "Legendary Warbond".</p>

<p>The crossover was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased" rel="nofollow">first teased</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>trailer promoting the game's Xbox release, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">set for next Tuesday</a>. Rather than a new map or an in-game event,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover will instead take the form of a Warbond.</p>

<p>That means you can expect new weapons, new armor and capes, and all the other good stuff that usually comes with a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, but as the "Legendary" designation suggests, Sony and Arrowhead reckon they're kicking it up a notch with this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=2ZatJhGW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=JR7IMNeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond brings lots of new&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>-themed gear to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>This Warbond comes complete with four weapons, and they should all be pretty familiar to&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fans. The MA5C assault rifle is an iconic weapon that packs an ammo counter and a compass, while the M6C pistol boasts <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s first suppressor.</p>

<p>The M90A shotgun has a flashlight attached to it to help you see what you're shooting in darker areas, and the M7S SMG includes a suppressor you can't remove, so it's perfect for sneakier engagements (although it'll still rip enemies to shreds in a loud firefight).</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond if there wasn't some armor to enjoy as well, and the&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond features two sets: the A-9 Helljumper and the A-35 Recon, both modeled after iconic&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>characters.</p>

<p>There's plenty more included as part of this Warbond as well, so make sure you check out the full announcement over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a> if you want to see everything that's included.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond will be available on August 26th, which is the same day the game launches on Xbox Series X|S. It's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">our review of it right here</a>.</p>

The name "Swords Of Legends" does not exactly cultivate intrigue. File it alongside Legendary Sword, Sword Legends, Legend of Sword, and Sword: Legends under "game titles that would put me to sleep even if I were being steadily electrocuted". Having visited the official site for Swords and watched the Chinese announcement trailer, I have come up with some alternative, vastly superior English titles: 1) My House Is Unaccountably Peckish, 2) Can I Play Football With This Boss's Detachable Head, 3) A Kingdom For My Horsebro, and 4) Did That Mountain Just Sideeye Me.</p><!--more-->

<p>
Developed by Aurogon Shanghai with Wangyuan Shengtang publishing, Sword Of Legends is the fourth main game in the Gujian series, which I'm not familiar with. Occasional Rock Paper Shotgun contributor Khee Hoon Chan has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gujian-3-comes-close-to-being-the-final-fantasy-of-chinese-rpgs/">a PCGamer write-up</a> of the third one in which they describe it as "close to being the Final Fantasy of Chinese RPGs". As with Final Fantasy, the devs insist that you don't need to have played the other Gujian games to enjoy this one.
</p>
<p>
The new game is a premium (i.e. not free-to-play) single player action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with an obvious Soulslike flow to its boss battles. You are an underworld enforcer who must "guide the departed" by kicking their heads in, whether attached or not. It's ceremonially described on the official site as "wide linear" - a mixture of story-led fights and sidequests that is neither as sprawling as an open world game, nor as suffocating as many Soulslikes. It's set, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, in a realm inspired by Chinese mythology and folklore.
</p><p>
As the aforesaid Stygian copper, your combat abilities range from combos, dodges and parries to capturing the souls of munsters and unleashing them against the next wayward phantom you encounter. There's a neat bit in the trailer when the player uses a companion creature's out-thrust spear as a springboard. Horseguy, you're so dependable! Not like those horsegirls in that viral gacha game the top brass keep telling me to write about.
</p>
<p>
I'd say I'm weary of action-RPGs inspired by Chinese myth, after Wuchang and Wukong, but that would be outright hypocrisy, given that I still knock back Tolkien-esque fantasies by the flagon. Besides, I've always wanted to be eaten by a house. It's probably the nearest I'll ever come to owning one. Swards Of Legumes doesn't have a release date yet, but there's a Q&amp;A with more details on <a href="https://www.swordsoflegends.com/?language=EN">the offical site</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-looks-like-way-more-than-just-another-switch-2-racing-game.1273695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A 45-minute deep-dive into <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> revealed all the ways it’s setting itself apart from other kart racers. While director Masahiro Sakurai began <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-kirby-air-riders-smash-bros-sakurai-2000618190">the latest Nintendo Direct</a> by joking that his new Switch 2 exclusive is basically <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569">just <em>Mario Kart</em></a>, everything that followed built the case for why it’s actually much more. Essentially a<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> Let’s Play starring the <em>Smash Bros.</em> director himself, the showcase revealed new modes, mechanics, and the game’s release date.</p> <p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will come to Switch 2 on November 20. In addition to the main racing mode, it’ll also feature a series of other contests, from time trials to a destruction mode that looks an awful lot like <em>Twisted Meta</em>l. The menus and sound effects look <a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-sakurai-youtube-sequel-switch-2-1851678195">straight out of <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, including the win screen that shows characters applauding. The entire showcase even ended with a surprise reveal for what seems to be a new Kirby character that looks like Meta Knight if he were dragged out of an alternate, post-apocalyptic dimension.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The main attraction in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the titular Air Riders mode. While it’s structured much like the original GameCube release back in 2003, a second button has been added to the control scheme. In addition to pressing a button to drift around corners and building up boost, characters also have access to a special ability that can be unleashed to speed up or attack other players. The courses are also bigger this time around to accommodate more racers, with an updated roster and vehicle garage for players to mix and match with.</p>

 <p>The returning City Trials mode looked with up to 16 players this time looks far more interesting. Like <em>Mario Kart World,</em> it drops you into a big sandbox where you drive around exploring and collecting power-ups. Random events then spawn that you can join to compete in with your upgraded vehicle. The challenges range from battles to gobbling up as much food on the map as possible. There are also mini-games reminiscent of hitting the sandbag in Smash Bros., with players aiming and flinging themselves at a wall of different scoring cubes to rack up points.</p> <p>Whether that’s all enough to make <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feel like the big November release the Switch 2 deserves remains to be seen. It’ll arrive just a month after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Sakurai ended his stream saying that there’s still more to reveal in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, hinting at another Nintendo Direct coming sometime in the fall. In the meantime, it would be great to get the GameCube version on Switch Online.</p>
