            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On paper, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> doesn’t seem to stand out amidst a recent wave of prestige RPGs, from the newly polished high fantasy of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda"><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remake</a> to the medieval warfare of 15th century Bohemia in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. </em>For one, its fantastical conquests are set in a world reminiscent of France’s Belle Époque period, an era known for its economic prosperity and radical artistic movements, from Art Nouveau to Expressionism. Add a tinge of melodrama and an emotional backstory, and its setting resembles a medley of games that take place in vaguely European worlds like <em>Greedfall</em>, <em>Bloodborne,</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. At the same time, <em>Expedition 33</em> boasts a turn-based combat system inspired by Japanese RPGs like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Ques</em>t.</p><p>All this is to say that <em>Expedition 33</em> risks appearing banal and cliche. Fending off impossible odds in a world, where everyone wants to swing their very imposing weapons at your head amidst medieval ruins, isn’t all that unique these days. But <em>Expedition 33</em> isn’t cowered by the lineage of RPGs that came before. Instead, it displays a sense of quiet confidence, understanding that the keys of the genre — narrative and combat — need to be distinct enough to weave a poignant tale.</p><p>This is embodied in the prologue, which takes its time to unfold the game’s emotional stakes. At the start you’re introduced to the scraggly-but-charismatic Gustav, who’s nervous about his meeting with ex-partner Sophie. Apart from going through the basics of combat, Gustav spends the first half of the chapter on a leisurely stroll with her along the town’s boulevard, as they make their way toward the harbor. It’s then that the game’s conceit is revealed: the Paintress, a malignant, immortal being of sorts, wakes up once a year to paint a number on a massive monolith, culling the town’s dwindling population. When this happens, everyone of that particular age simply dissipates into petals. It’s a moment that could easily tip into mawkishness, but a palpable feeling of melancholia sets in. A lump in your throat lingers.</p><p>This scene sets the tone for the rest of <em>Expedition 33</em>. You guide a group of doomed Expeditioners like Gustav, who are embarking on a last-ditch attempt to stop the Paintress. It would’ve been easy for <em>Expedition 33</em> to plunge into an never-ending cycle of abject hopelessness, but there’s a genuine sense of wonder in traveling beyond the small town of Lumiere, and toward the vast expanse of its larger, phantasmagoric world.</p><p>One landscape has towering pink corals and shimmering sea flora, swaying like underwater tendrils, with bubbling streams rising from the ground. Another showcases the remnants of Art Nouveau architecture, with dilapidated buildings rife with elegant curves and floral patterns, as well as marble faces carved onto their surfaces. It’s as if these lands, once rich with history and biodiversity, have long been wrecked by a cataclysmic war. Despite the looming threat of certain death, even the Expeditioners were awed by the painterly allure of their surroundings, almost thrilled to be on such a lustrous journey. </p><p>Equally — and unexpectedly — resplendent is the game’s combat. Encounters typically begin with the crew striking some monstrous titans with an initial, vibrant blow (or, in unlucky instances, with enemies walking into them), and being transported to a grandiose arena. These scenes are beautiful tableaus, with every attack depicted with the finesse and flourish of stylish sword fights.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em>’s turn-based combat appears deceptively straightforward. You can issue commands to each Expeditioner every turn, who have their own impressive set of moves. The backbone of Gustav’s attacks, for instance, is his prosthetic arm, which allows him to charge up his assaults and subsequently land a powerful finisher. Whereas another Expeditioner, Lune, embodies the mage archetype with several elemental spells at her disposal.</p><p>Adding a wrinkle to this turn-based formula is that enemy attacks can be dodged and parried. When timed right, this allows you to collect more action points for pulling off a string of attacks, or launching a countermove. Performing twitchy maneuvers like these are incredibly satisfying. A perfectly timed parry can easily turn the tide of combat, letting you deal a massive amount of damage. That’s not to say that battles are easy; executing these moves, at the right time, is contingent on your understanding of enemy movements, some of whom are prone to feigning their attacks. Most enemies even present their own twists to combat, which makes every tussle substantial.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Sandfall Interactive</cite></p></div><p>Adding some tactical diversity to combat are Pictos, which are items the Expeditioners can equip to buff their attacks. This is, by far, one of the smartest tricks <em>Expedition 33</em> has up its sleeve. There are plenty of these to collect across the map, so you can further customize each Expeditioner to a specific, preferred build. Gustav’s Overcharge, for instance, requires him to land a flurry of melee assaults to charge up the skill, so I prefer to equip him with Pictos that increase the potency of his attacks.</p><p>This is how <em>Expedition 33</em> lets you subtly refine the cadence of battles. And then there’s the joy of the grind; if an enemy proves to be too overwhelming, you can always plow through ramshackle bands of mechanical titans for experience points. That’s because the ritual of grinding in <em>Expedition 33</em> is deeply cerebral, rather than mindlessly tedious, with every encounter a sizable, yet surmountable challenge. Plus, swinging enormous swords and scythes at the heads of Expedition 33’s monstrous giants — accompanied by a rousing, atmospheric soundtrack — lets your attacks land with a really meaty thump. Fighting is a grand, stupendous affair.</p><p>There’s much more to say about the sheer extravagance of <em>Expedition 33</em>. Its characters carry shades of complexity and compassion that surface in their conversations. Its music swells and swirls with orchestral lavishness, punctuating every interaction with a note of majesty or calamity. Its tale is heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous in equal measure. Some parts of <em>Expedition 33 </em>can be a tad superfluous — like the need to put a numerical value in the Expeditioners’ relationships, and certain dialog choices that make little sense — but these do little to mar its experience.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em> is built upon the conventional anchors of its genre. But its grandiose tale, bolstered by a downright robust combat system, turns it into something much more than just a scrappy underdog.</p><p><sub>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<em> is available now on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Re-reincarnation.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you enjoyed NieR: Automata and its predecessor, NieR: Replicant, you could be forgiven for not knowing that game actually got a sequel, and a pretty good one too. Unfortunately, that sequel, mobile game NieR: Re[in]carnation, hasn't been available for almost a year after being taken offline in April of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fortunately, a Square Enix website is dropping some pretty wild in-universe hints that this might be about to change.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As pointed out to us on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journalist Willa Rowe</a>, an official NieR website that's currently publishing a NieR special movel to commemorate the series 15th anniversary is teasing something NieR: Re[in]carnation-related via cryptic in-text hints and webpage source code. As a part of today's update to the novel, the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just-published chapter 4</a> ends with some strange text that reads as follows:</p><blockquote>[WARNING] : Recovery protocol initialized...[ERROR] : Redirecting to backup node: &lt; https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/ &gt;[INFO] : Analysis comments added to the source code.<br>[FATAL] : Process forcibly halted.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does THAT mean? Who knows? But wait, there's more. If you hit "View Source" on that page, there are even more weird teases in the code comments, as hinted at above. They read, in order:</p><blockquote>SECURITY NOTICE: Unauthorized transmission detected. Signal disruption logged. Countermeasure protocol active. Redirecting to backup node: <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/</a></blockquote><blockquote>TODO: Optimize rendering efficiency.

He is watching...Adjust access permissions before deployment. His name is............</blockquote><blockquote>HACK: Log discrepancy detected. Records indicate previous modification attempts due to excessive interference from The Cage. Cross-check against original transmission before proceeding.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, there's a lot here, some of which is inscrutable and some of which makes sense. "The Cage", for instance, is the main location where most of NieR: Re[in]carnation takes place. And "Her" is a key character (yes, that's Her name) in Re[in]carnation as well. Between that and the hyperlink, it's pretty obvious what all this is referencing, but what exactly will become of it remains anyone's guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two final chapters of the novel are scheduled to publish on May 2, a week from today, and it's possible it may also pull back the curtain on whatever's happening here. Fans are speculating that it may be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NieRReincarnation/comments/1k7l4ym/new_nier_15th_anniversary_web_novel_chapters_14/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading up to some sort of port or re-release of NieR: Re[in]carnation</a>, which has been completely unplayable anywhere since it went offline last year. They're also pointing out that the chapters of the special novel, which are currently only available in Japanese (but which fans are translating), have some pretty significant tie-ins to all three other NieR games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  NieR Reincarnation</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with Re[in]carnation, I highly recommend keeping an eye on this, especially if the end result is another opportunity to play it. Re[in]carnation is a good game in its own right that many slept on due to its being a mobile gacha game, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">critically, it's also the direct sequel to NieR: Automata</a>, and effectively is NieR 3, for those who have been waiting for it. Who knows? Maybe a new Re[in]carnation release could include some new content that ties the ongoing stream of loose NieR-related threads together at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

		<p><em>Few things underscore the differences between Rob and Patrick more than their approach to playing new video games, which is to say that Patrick is often spending his time with The Next Thing, while Rob continues to mine the past.</em></p><p><em>That split is part of what makes Remap what it is, though!</em></p><p><em>Plus, who doesn't want an excuse to talk about BioForge? Who isn't excited to potentially have Rob and Cado playing Myth II: Soulblighter co-op on stream? It's our Remember Some Games era and it's great.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So we talked about this on the podcast, but I’ve spent a decent chunk of this week playing <em>Myth: The Fallen Lords </em>and <em>Myth 2: Soulblighter</em>. They just had some amazing updates drop from the Project Magma team, who have basically been working to keep the <em>Myth </em>series playable for the last fifteen years. The new update is called the <em>Twice Born Edition </em>and it’s as close to a remaster as the game is likely to get.</p><p><em>Myth </em>is one of my all-time favorite games. There are countless games that channel or outright copy from Tolkien, but <em>Myth </em>is one of the few that I think fully understands how the Lord of the Rings experience should be translated into a game. Mission briefings are given via bleak, well-written journal entries that evoke the idea that the game itself is a found text, like the history the Fellowship finds in the depths of Moria. Unit descriptions are pieces of larger, unseen texts (a technique that would resurface with <em>Destiny’s </em>Grimoire), and that narrative device suggests a world of cultures, languages, and histories both known and lost to time.</p><p>The narrative points to epic battles happening off-screen but the game is not aiming to be a fantasy <em>Total War</em>. Rather it plays out like a miniatures game, one where each warrior must be painstakingly positioned and maneuvered to get the most out of them in battle. You’re usually with a special forces team or a beleaguered rearguard or a clever diversionary raiding party, in situations where you still feel like you’re part of a military fantasy epic, but the scale is a little more personal, and little more ground-level.</p><p>Which means you have ample opportunities to witness the chaos caused by the game’s physics model. Stray arrows knock out friendly troops, grenades take miraculous or cursed bounces or turn out to be duds. Flying bits of debris (usually bone and meat, being honest) will smack into other units and cause damage, or perhaps knock a spear off-course. It’s a game that feels gleefully at odds with a lot of notions of game balance: the same encounter in <em>Myth </em>might go horrifically wrong despite your best efforts or you might make a horrible mistake that somehow breaks in your favor and hands you a wholly unearned victory. But because this is all depicted on screen and driven by some simple physics and overpowered explosives, <em>Myth </em>usually feels funny and surprising rather than a game where you can get screwed by a bad dice roll.</p><p>This game also served as my introduction to Bungie, and I was kind of surprised when the next I heard of them was when they were in the early stages of promoting <em>Halo </em>before it was picked up by Microsoft. I didn’t know about their history as a shoot developer for Macs, and so I was kind of disappointed when the studio that made this fantasy tactics masterpiece became Halo Incorporated. At the time I thought <em>Halo </em>was the outlier, now I understand that if anything, the two <em>Myth </em>games are a wildly successful experiment from a shooter studio.</p><p>Playing it this week got me wondering, are there studios you’ve been a fan of that have a game or a series that fascinates you <em>because </em>it doesn’t seem to fit what they are known for?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Back when they made real box art, folks.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/53we99/backflips_n_bioforge/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>“Did that say mecha raptor?”</u></a></p><p>Yeah, this one is easy. It’s Origin Systems making <em>BioForge</em>. I first fell for Origin Systems because of the <em>Wing Commander</em> series. More specifically, <em>Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger</em>. The more CDs a game shipped with, the better, imo. Remember <a href="https://www.indieretronews.com/2020/03/wing-commander-iii-heart-of-tiger-1994.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>that killer box art</u></a>? Absolutely irresistible. But this was an era where it wasn’t easy to look up the history of a studio, unless you came across it in, say, a <em>PC Gamer</em>.</p><p>In my mind, Origin made <em>Wing Commander</em> games, or at the very least, flight simulator games. It was 1994 and I was nine years old. I didn’t know what <em>Ultima</em> was. I didn’t know about <em>System Shock</em>, either.</p>

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive has announced that the game has already sold 500,000 copies, just after launch. In a social media post, the studio said the game reached this sales milestone "sooner than we'd ever imagined."</p><p>Expedition 33 is also on Game Pass, and presumably the 500,000 figure does not include people playing via the subscription service. Expedition 33 is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 2 best-selling game on Steam right now</a>, only behind Oblivion Remastered, and it's reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 70,000 concurrent players.</a> The game is also on PS5.</p><p>Some industry observers theorized that Expedition 33 might have had its lunch eaten by Oblivion Remastered, as it surprise-launched just two days before Expedition 33. Both are Game Pass titles, but clearly, there is enough room for multiple success stories this week. Both Bethesda and Sandfall <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-dev-congratulates-expedition-33-studio-on-game-pass-launch/1100-6531082/" data-ref-id="1100-6531082">shared congratulatory messages with each other</a> regarding their respective game launches this week.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a core team of around 30 people at Sandfall.

            <p>
Facebook owner Meta has reportedly cut over 100 jobs at Reality Labs, the division responsible for its virtual reality and augmented reality software and hardware, including Quest.
</p>
<p>
The news was initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/655835/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-supernatural">reported by The Verge</a>, whose sources said the cuts had impacted teams within Meta's Oculus Studios - which is focused on developing games for the company's Quest headsets - as well as "some" employees from Reality Labs' hardware arm. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true">later reported "more than 100" workers were impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed cuts had been made within Oculus Studios, saying "some" teams were "undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size." Clayton added the changes were intended to "help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today." The Verge says Meta declined to comment on layoffs outside of Oculus Studios.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff include the team behind Meta Quest fitness application Supernatural, which Meta acquired for $400m USD - alongside its developer Within - in 2023, following an anti-trust battle with the FTC. The Supernatural team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/getsupernatural/permalink/9571469649572696/">confirmed it had been affected by Meta's latest layoffs</a> in a statement shared on Facebook, writing it was "deeply saddened" by the loss of "some of our incredibly talented team members".
</p>
<p>
Despite the layoffs, Meta says it remains "committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged."
</p>
<p>
Meta has dramatically reduced staff numbers of the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-announces-further-10000-job-losses">cutting more than 20,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023</a>. Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn - which Meta acquired in 2020 - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-heavily-impacted-by-latest-meta-layoffs">heavily impacted</a> by those cuts and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-and-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down-by-meta">closed down at the end of last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Reality Labs layoffs follow Meta's admission last April that the AR/VR <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-loses-a-billion-per-month-on-its-arvr-division-but-believes-it-will-be-worth-it">division had lost over $1bn every month</a> for most of the last two years, with the company saying it expected losses to increase as it deepened its investment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/reburn-has-delayed-la-quimera-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight-after-sending-out-review-codes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>La Quimera is a new first-person, linear, story-focused shooter from <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-developer-qa-powered-by-unreal-engine-4-main-story-to-last-5-hours/">Reburn</a>, the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, which previously worked on the Metro series with the rest of 4A Games based in Malta.</p>
<p>It was initially set to release today, April 25, 2025. The release date was set at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/">beginning of April</a>, and review codes were sent out to Wccftech and other members of the press ahead of today's launch. Shortly after reviews went live, Reburn announced within its Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/la-quimera-has-been-quietly-delayed-no-new-release-date/">DSOGaming</a>) that La Quimera was delayed, with no new release date set.</p>
<p>In a statement, chief executive officer Dmytro Lymar apologized for the last-minute delay and attributed the issues Reburn had to unexpected problems it faced with this being its first project as an independent studio and "<em>the circumstances we're faced with here in the Ukraine</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We'd like to apologise for the unexpected delay in getting La Quimera out to you, our fans and supporters. Our team here at Reburn has been working hard on the game, and it being our first title as an independent game developer has led to some unforeseen challenges. We are trying our best to address the matters as quickly as possible, while also navigating the circumstances we're faced with here in the Ukraine. We thank you for your patience, your continued support, and your understanding.</em>"</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/">review of La Quimera</a>, we noted plenty of bugs, which, on their own, made it abundantly clear that it needed more time in development. But the bugs weren't the only issues the game had. Core issues with the story and characters, with gameplay that only features a few cool moments, are all problems that take more than a few rounds of bug fixes to fix.</p>
<p>"<em>La Quimera is an incomplete game, a mixture of stitched together parts that don't come together to make a full image,</em>" our reviewer wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>The amount of bugs are clear indicators that this game needed more time in development, but so is the underwhelming story and gameplay that aren't given enough time to go anywhere. If La Quimera was communicated as an Early Access release, then I'd be more hopeful for what's to come, but if this is meant to be the full game, it's not one that's worth your time.</em>"</p>

Bubble Season starts April 29th and will include a new area, new activities, and, of course, new (and returning) outfits. But the biggest addition is one that fans have been asking for since launch: co-op. Check out the trailer above.</p><p>In the new season you’ll be able to have dress-up adventures with a friend in two player co-op mode. You can travel the world of<em> Infinity Nikki </em>together, solving special co-op mode puzzle games and participating in escort missions. Players will also prove they’re the most stylish one in the group chat with a fashion runway and new interactions that players can use in all the photos they’re going to take. </p><p>Like every new <em>Infinity Nikki</em> season, there will be special outfits to collect – though none of them inspire in me the kind of fanaticism that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">the cowgirl outfit</a> from two seasons ago did. (Which I did get without spending any money. Hooray!) For the first time though, <em>IN</em> is also bringing back outfits from previous seasons for players who missed out on them and for newbies to build up their wardrobe quickly. </p><div><p>Speaking of wardrobe,<em> Infinity Nikk</em>i is catching up to the MMO girlies by implementing a new dye system. In Bubble Season, players will be able to use dyes to change the color of their outfits the same way one can in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. No word on exactly how dyes will work or if they will be yet more things to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">spend your precious currency on</a>. But I am interested in the potential of getting new colors for my clothes without the hassle of the current system, which involves the expensive and time consuming process of collecting duplicate outfits.</p><p>Bubble Season starts April 29th and if you’re one of the folks waiting for the game to come to PC, the Steam version of<em> Infinity Nikki </em>launches that day too.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll first encounter locked chests in the underground caverns beneath the prison, and then in nearly every dungeon thereafter. It’s a core component of the game. It’s also one of the most cumbersome to some players. But mastering the mini-game and leveling up essential skills will quickly turn your fortunes around. Eventually you’ll be putting the Gray Fox himself to shame.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196470,196848" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h180767"><a id=""></a>Skills that affect lockpicking</h2><figure id="" data-id="653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-recommend-id="image://653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-recommend-id="image://653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you think you’ll spend a lot of time lockpicking as a stealthy character, like one of the many members of the Thieves’ Guild, then <strong>you’ll want to increase your Security</strong>.</p><p>Like all other skills in the game, there are five levels to Security:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Novice (0)</strong>: Up to four tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Apprentice (25)</strong>: Up to three tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Journeyman (50)</strong>: Up to two tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Expert (75)</strong>: Only one tumbler will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Master (100)</strong>: No tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li></ul><p>You can level the skill by attempting lockpicks and speaking with the occasional thief or beggar to train your abilities higher in exchange for gold.</p><h2 id="h180768"><a id=""></a>How to lockpick successfully</h2><figure id="" data-id="21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-recommend-id="image://21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-recommend-id="image://21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before you attempt to break into a treasure chest filled with junk that you’ll likely toss aside to satisfy your weight limit, you must have lockpicks in your inventory.

                <p dir="ltr">In an industry overflowing with news regarding layoffs, closures, and reduction, any example of a company withstanding the tests of time is worthy of celebration. Gameloft is one such company, and right now it's in celebration mode as it commemorates its 25th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">What started as a small mobile gaming outfit has grown into a firm that employs over 2,900 people across 10 studios. With a mix of popular original IP and licensed games in its portfolio, Gameloft is poised to stick around for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with Gameloft CEO Alexandre de Rochefort to reflect on the past 25 years of Gameloft's history. He speaks about the main reasons Gameloft has been able to persist, four essential turning points in the history of the company, and the challenges of overcoming the perceived stigmas of the mobile gaming scene.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482831-asphalt-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482831-asphalt-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482831"></a><figcaption>Asphalt 9: Legends</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482831-asphalt-9.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Agility" is key</h2><p dir="ltr">If there's a single word de Rochefort would use to describe Gameloft's persistence in the gaming industry--and he would know, as he's been with the company for its entire existence--it's "agility." In his view, the company has always shown the ability to adapt when needed, especially at the dawning of the mobile gaming boom.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every six months, it seems, we've been faced with critical changes, either within Gameloft or within the industry," de Rochefort says. "The number one reason I'm still here in the company is that I'm still having fun, because every six months there's something radically new happening." Laying out the timeline of Gameloft's history, de Rochefort points to four key moments that, according to him, played a major role in the direction Gameloft would take.</p><p dir="ltr">The first date the Gameloft CEO mentions is January 2003, when the Java programming language was added to Nokia and Siemens mobile phones. This, as de Rochefort explains, was the spark needed to turn the mobile gaming industry into what it is today.</p><p dir="ltr">"2000 through 2002 were extremely harsh years, both for Gameloft and for the few competitors that we had at the time, because nothing was happening in our space," de Rochefort explains. "We were right in our vision, but we were too early; thank God the Java technology was introduced.</p><p dir="ltr">The second core date in Gameloft's history is also a universal change: July 2008, which marked the introduction of the Apple App Store for the iPhone. This was a "game-changer," as de Rochefort describes, not only for Gameloft but for the entire industry, as it "kickstarted the growth of the industry" via smartphone and tablet gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Next on de Rochefort's list of key moments is more nebulous than the previous two, but its effects are no less important: de Rochefort credits the rise of free-to-play gaming from 2010-2012 as essential to Gameloft's future, as it marked a second boom in the mobile gaming sphere--as well as gaming as whole. "For me, [free-to-play] goes well beyond mobile; it's a defining moment for the video game industry," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">The final milestone on the list of important dates, unlike the previous two, is specific to Gameloft: In January 2019, the company decided to branch out from phones and tablets to home consoles and PC, and doing so allowed them to grow the business not just in revenue, but in partnerships with other companies.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the time, Apple and Google were our biggest partners--and for a time, our only partners," de Rochefort said. "Now, when I look at the charts, we have seven, eight, nine different partners, and Apple and Google are now somewhere in the middle." Who, then, has taken their place at the top of Gameloft's partnership ranks? According to de Rochefort, it's Nintendo.</p><p dir="ltr">De Rochefort says that while moving away from mobile exclusivity has some drawbacks, it ultimately allows the company to be more agile in the long run. "By transitioning these teams to PC and console, we do release less games than we used to per year," he explains, "but the ambition that we have on those games is way more significant. Now, the majority of our games are meant to be cross platform between PC, console, and mobile."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482835-ddv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482835" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482835-ddv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482835"></a><figcaption>Disney Dreamlight Valley</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482835-ddv.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Defeating the stereotypes</h2><p dir="ltr">For some, the term "mobile game" comes with a set of stereotypes rooted in the predatory "gacha"-style tactics designed to separate a player from their money. de Rochefort is very aware of this, and he prides himself on Gameloft's games creating a barrier between those methods and the studio's games.</p><p dir="ltr">Having lived through the entire history of mobile gaming, de Rochefort feels the company is uniquely qualified to avoid such pitfalls. "We've been in the mobile space forever, and this was not how mobile gaming used to be," he says.</p><p dir="ltr">"With our Java games from 2003-2008, and then from 2008-2012, we were selling super high-quality mobile games for a premium price of $5 to $10," de Rochefort says. At the time, things were fair, straightforward, and easy to understand--and then free-to-play arrived."</p><p dir="ltr">There's a clear divide, in de Rochefort's opinion, when it comes to the overall reaction to free-to-play games. Some players, particularly younger players or those living in countries where mobile gaming is the most ubiquitous, are used to the free-to-play model and can identify when a game is particularly aggressive. Other players, those who grew up with console and PC gaming before mobile phones became a viable platform, are the ones who look down on the practice as predatory.</p><p dir="ltr">For his part, de Rochefort recognizes that "some games have been super aggressive and hurt the industry badly," but he has worked to ensure that Gameloft treats their players as fairly as possible. "I think free-to-play is fine, but it's important for the companies in this industry to make sure that we stay within the boundaries of what is fair to the user, and we really try to do that," he says. "I really don't think we're one of the greedy companies."</p><p dir="ltr">de Rochefort cites Disney Dreamlight Valley as an example: DDV is a premium game with an upfront cost, and it does include extra items and cosmetics purchased with in-game currency. However, as de Rochefort describes, "you can finish and can play every part of the main game without ever having to spend any extra money, and we try to avoid the traps of being too aggressive with things like paywalls and the like."</p><p dir="ltr">He also mentions in-game advertising as an example; free-to-play games feature many in-game ads, but "less than 10 percent of [Gameloft's] revenue" comes from advertising. "We've always wanted to make sure we make real gaming experiences," de Rochefort says. "That's why we didn't go hypercasual; it's simply not in our DNA."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482836-oregon-trail.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482836" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482836-oregon-trail.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482836"></a><figcaption>The Oregon Trail (2019)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482836-oregon-trail.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Positioning for the future</h2><p dir="ltr">Just before the interview, Gameloft announced a 25th-anniversary celebration which would give players across its portfolio free in-game currency. 21 different games are included in the promotion, and maintaining 21 different games is no small feat. de Rochefort, however, says the company is well-equipped to handle them thanks to its 2900 employees across 10 studios.</p><p dir="ltr">The company was not immune to the recent wave of layoffs, however, with Gameloft Toronto seeing 49 employees laid off in 2024. de Rochefort is hopeful the worst is in the past, both for Gameloft and the industry at large, as long as companies are realistic in their goals.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the industry is arriving at a more mature state after three difficult years for the video game industry," de Rochefort says. "We are optimistic, because we simply accept the fact that the industry is not going to grow double digits like it had in the 10 years prior to 2021. I don't see the growth engine that could allow the industry to grow like that coming in the next four or five years."</p><p dir="ltr">For Gameloft's part, staying afloat means a healthy mix of original IP and licensed games, and there are a lot of plans in the pipeline. Internal IP like Asphalt, Gangstar, and Dungeon Hunter are balanced with the aforementioned Disney Dreamlight Valley, an upcoming Dungeon and Dragons game in partnership with Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast, and a few other "unannounced titles" on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">The "agility" that's so important to de Rochefort's vision can also be seen in how many platform Gameloft games can be found on: along with PC, consoles, and traditional mobile marketplaces like the App Store, the company has focused on newer subscription services like Apple Arcade and Netflix Games to show off their games.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think we're the biggest supplier of games to Apple Arcade; we've launched eight games with them already, and we have more to come," de Rochefort says. "Same thing with Netflix, we've released four games there, and hopefully we'll have more games coming in the future."</p><p dir="ltr">As far as what future Gameloft titles may look like, however, the company knows there's no specific blueprint to follow. "There's no miracle recipe for a blockbuster, as you know, because if there were, we would all be doing the same games," de Rochefort says.</p><p dir="ltr">He does, however, make one prediction: The days of Gameloft developing games exclusively for mobile devices are likely over. "We will try and maximize our odds by being super clear on what kind of games we want to do, and we want to do cross-platform," de Rochefort explains. "We will probably not do mobile-only games anymore; if anything, we'll do a PC and console game, and we'll make the effort of porting the game to mobile."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Requisitions are sets of items that include weapons, equipment, and cosmetics. Players can obtain items in Requisitions using "Lost Assets," the in-game currency earned by completing Jobs. "Play the game, unlock stuff. Simple," the developer post succinctly reads.</p><p>Unlike other modern online games, which feature timed battle passes and stores with rotating items, FBC: Firebreak will offer its Requisitions permanently. Players will be able to choose which items to unlock in any order they please, and they can make progress in earning items from multiple Requisitions at once.</p><p>Meanwhile, Classified Requisitions are "premium" cosmetic item sets that cost real money and include armor sets, sprays, and weapon skins. Remedy did not clarify in the post how much these item sets will cost, but the studio promises that they will have "no impact on gameplay."</p><p>The Deluxe Edition of FBC: Firebreak, which goes for an extra $10 (the base game is modestly priced at $40), comes with the "Firestarter" Classified Requisition, which contains 36 unlockable cosmetic items.</p><p>This Requisitions structure resembles the Helldivers 2 Warbonds system, letting players earn rewards at their own pace and not be vulnerable to potential FOMO. As GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-fbc-firebreak-is-more-left-4-dead-than-live-service-and-thats-the-beauty-of-it/1100-6530228/" data-ref-id="1100-6530228">FBC: Firebreak preview</a> points out, the game "doesn't punish you for not playing on its schedule."</p><p>When FBC: Firebreak launches on June 17, it'll be on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-will-feature-cross-play-multiplayer/1100-6530895/" data-ref-id="1100-6530895">full cross-play support</a>. Subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and PS Plus (Extra and Premium) can hop on the game on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/656169/wd-black-c50-xbox-storage-card-m4-macbook-air-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Maybe, like me, you bought the Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage and realized, after installing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,</em> that you don’t have much (or any) space left for any other games. And maybe, like me, you had to hunt for another drive so you could install other games to play.</p><p>If you’re still in that boat, you might want to consider Western Digital’s 2TB WD_Black NVMe solid state drive. It’s currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DK74LG91/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon for an all-time low of $179.99</a> ($50 off), or about 22 percent off the standard price, and will provide you with plenty of additional storage to work with. To put the price in perspective, it’s only $30 more than the 1TB version, which isn’t on sale. WD is also one of two manufacturers I’m aware of that make these easy plug-in cards — the other is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712516/xbox-expansion-cards-seagate-price-cut-deal-sale">Seagate</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->180</span></p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs. They offer a slightly lower-cost alternative to Seagate’s expansion cards, which were the only game in town for years.</p></div></div><p>There’s no fiddling around with screws or anything to get it to work, either. Just pop it into the back of your Xbox Series S / X, and bam, you’re good to go. Plug and play at its finest, baby.</p><p>But let’s pivot to another good deal real quick.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1883962-REG%2Fapple_mw123ll_a_13_macbook_air_m4.html%2FkZa17940ZSRrfIj%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw5azABhD1ARIsAA0WFUGYcUxik6ZHlmds-QlwCWAQgyNHflK_dp8WpOc1Xjs6EEW8YhjAkFcaArdXEALw_wcB" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> are also selling Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">brand-new M4 MacBook Air</a>, which just launched in March, starting at $899 (its best price to date). That’s $100 off Apple’s starting price of $999, which itself is already $100 cheaper than the entry-level price of the M3 model last year.</p><p>And, with the M4, you get 256GB of starting storage instead of 128GB, which is probably fine for most folks who don’t need a lot of local storage. Like me, for example. I’m using an M2 MacBook Air for work, and I only have 82GB used.</p><p>The latest M4 model also has a better 12-megapixel Center Stage camera that will follow your face around while you’re on camera (better said: it’ll keep you in frame) and 16GB of RAM. The design is unchanged from last year, which means you’re still getting just a MagSafe charger and two USB-C ports. But the update to M4 allows you to add two external monitors while also leaving the display open, for a total of three running screens. Good for multitasking.</p><p>It’s a MacBook Air. It’s the best MacBook for most people. You really can’t go wrong here.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
