            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Genshin Impact developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-developer-mihoyo-will-go-for-realistic-graphics-for-its-unreal-engine-5-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">miHoYo</a> has just unveiled its next open world game, Varsapura, with a 31-minute gameplay video.</p>



<p>The developers haven't shared much in the way of official details, but the footage provides more than a glimpse at what players will find in this upcoming title. The setting is a surreal, near-future city plagued by Mind Rot, a sort of parapsychological force that erodes reality, spawns monsters, and threatens both minds and the world at large.</p>



<p>It's all quite mysterious and subtly unsettling, a blend of bureaucracy (chiefly the SEAL, Shadow Emergency Alliance), psychic hazards, and mind-bending realities that reminded us of Remedy's Control. At the beginning of the demo, the player starts as an applicant to SEAL and undergoes mind-verification, interviews, and psychological evaluation as they attempt to join an organization dedicated to containing or reversing mind rot events. Later, they become an operational SEAL officer, and that's where we first see the combat of Varsapura. It looks like a fairly standard action combat system, featuring fast-paced action where the protagonist uses an umbrella to damage foes both in melee and from afar.</p>



<p>Some missions seemingly involve environmental hazards and puzzles, such as avoiding mind rot contamination, reacting to unstable environments, and using unique character abilities. Moreover, unlike in Control and more like miHoYo's games, the player will be able to count on the help of NPC squadmates.</p>



<p>At some point in the demo, we see that players will be able to drive vehicles to navigate the open-world environment. Varsapura also appears to offer RPG-style dialogue options to choose from, and some of them even seem to use specific character attributes or skills, like Empathy, Persuasion, or Deception, to accomplish their goal. Of course, the extent of the dialogue's consequences remains unclear at this point. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Varsapura, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, is still clearly a long way from launch. In fact, miHoYo is recruiting more people across its <a href="https://jobs.mihoyo.com/#/position?jobName=Varsapura" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shanghai</a>, <a href="https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/careers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore, and Los Angeles</a> offices to work on the project.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-is-now-available-on-xbox-series-s-x-at-50-launch-discount.1360426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB's rating of Silent Hill 2 on Xbox</a>, KONAMI has announced today that the remake of the classic survival horror game is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/SILENT-HILL-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now available on Xbox Series S and X and on the Xbox PC Store</a>. The game actually supports Xbox Play Anywhere, so you'll get it on both platforms with a single purchase.</p>



<p>The Japanese publisher has also attached a promotion to the launch: the game's Standard and Deluxe Edition are currently 50% off on the new platform, and the same applies on PlayStation 5. The Steam version doesn't have any discount for the time being, but KONAMI might just be waiting for the platform's Black Friday sale to trigger it.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 Standard Edition is thus priced at $34.99 on the Xbox ecosystem, while the Deluxe Edition costs $39.99. There is also a dual pack with Silent Hill f, which launched a couple of months ago. The Standard Edition of this dual pack is priced at $79.99, while the Deluxe Edition will set you back $95.99. Silent Hill f is also separately discounted by 20% as part of KONAMI's Black Friday sale.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was released in October 2024 to widespread acclaim. Bloober Team's work <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a 9 out of 10 here on Wccftech</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>



<p><em>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</em></p>



<p>To date, the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has sold more than 2.5 million units</a>, making it likely this Xbox release will push it toward 3 million copies sold in the near future. Following this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful release of Silent Hill f</a>, the franchise's next installment is the spin-off Townfall, which a retailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently listed for a March 2026 debut</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Wasn’t Acquired, Says Accounting Issue Was Cause of Earnings Delay]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-wasnt-acquired-says-accounting-issue-was-cause-of-earnings-delay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-wasn%E2%80%99t-acquired-says-accounting-issue-was-cause-of-earnings-delay.1360423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s latest earnings report is live, revealing that the company wasn’t acquired and that an accounting issue caused the earnings delay.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-on-hold-financial-report-published/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Ubisoft’s H1 FY 2025-26&nbsp;earnings report has been put on hold, and it will be published before trading opens on Friday, November 21. Now, that day has arrived, and we have received some exciting details from the report, including what OT really is. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-earnings-report-reveals-details-on-tencent-deal">Ubisoft Earnings Report Reveals Details on Tencent Deal</h2>



<p>The new earnings <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/0c7fff607779c63e137037bc5c95a000/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> deal reveals that Tencent’s €1.16 investment in Vantage Studios should close in the coming days as all conditions precedent have been satisfied. The transaction will deleverage the group and accelerate Vantage Studios’ IP. Moreover, a cash position of €668m and the €1.16bn will significantly deleverage the group and enable it to make early repayments of the €286m Term Loan and Schuldschein loans.</p>



<p>Moreover, the company revealed that it has “reviewed its analysis relating to the IFRS 15 revenue recognition of a partnership in FY2024-25,” leading it to restate its FY2024-25 accounts under IAS 8. The Ubisoft report reveals that this position, applied by the group, led to a partnership signed in Q2 FY2025-26 not being recognized as IFRS 15 revenue, resulting in the company “not complying with its leverage covenant ratio under certain existing financing agreements at September 30, 2025.”</p>



<p>However, this will be addressed through the previously mentioned “early repayment of the Term Loan and Schuldschein<br>loans which have an outstanding principal amount of c.€286m.” Additionally, the restatement didn’t impact the group’s non-IFRS indicators. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the Chief Financial Officer at Ubisoft, Frederick Duguet, had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> staff that they were pausing Ubisoft’s stock “to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility.” Ubisoft had requested that Euronext halt trading of its shares and bonds until the “publication of its first-half 2025-26 results.” Now that the report is finally live, players should expect trading in Ubisoft stocks to resume. </p>







<p> In other news, Ubisoft has stated that people are “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-people-playing-fewer-games-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing fewer games</a>,” which makes it harder for new games to stand out. Additionally, Mark Rubin has revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mark-rubin-splinter-cell-ubisoft-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splinter Cell was not cancelled to make XDefiant</a>.

Eve sets out to destroy the Elder Naytibas and reclaim Earth, while also carving a path forward through the Alpha Naytibas and their minions.</p><p>Stellar Blade features many elements that are similar to the Souls-like genre--from challenging boss fights to campsites that respawn monsters when you rest at them--but it also merges those mechanics with more traditional action game ideas, allowing you to increase Eve's power and skillset steadily along the way. Since launch, Stellar Blade has received numerous updates. Eve's wardrobe has been expanded with several new outfits, and paid DLC expansions have seen the crossovers with Nier: Automata and Goddess of Victory: Nikke.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're interested in checking out PlayStation's other Black Friday deals, be sure to check out the lists below.

Graphical improvements and improved loading times on PS5 make for welcome improvements, and the game also features behind-the-scenes commentary from developers at Naughty Dog to show how several scenes were created, unlockable visual filters and cheat codes, Lost Levels that let you explore early-development versions of three levels not seen in the original game, and the fan-favorite Guitar Free Play mode for when you want to strum a few chords.</p><p>The other big addition was No Return, a roguelike survival mode that tests your skills against scavengers, bandits, and infected people in across a series of levels. The mode has since received several updates since it was first introduced, and it even includes an unlockable cosmetic inspired by Naughty Dog's next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>If you've never played it, The Last of Us is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where society has collapsed after a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus has infected and turned most of the populace into rabid monsters. The first game explored themes of loss and redemption as protagonists Joel and Ellie trekked across the remains of the US, while the sequel is a brutal tale of revenge. Both games are among the most critically acclaimed titles on the PS5, thanks to their harrowing post-apocalyptic stories, which have been adapted into the ongoing The Last of Us TV series on HBO.</p><p>PS5 fans have plenty of other <a href="https://amzn.to/4i4kbt7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Black Friday deals</a> to take advantage of, including discounts on games, collector's editions, controllers, and more.

                <p>One of the biggest recent hits on PS5 has been Helldivers 2, a game best described as an online, PvE multiplayer third-person shooter with a satircal tone that melds Starship Troopers with Warhammer 40,000. If you haven't yet enlisted in Super Earth's war machine, you can finally join the fight with this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> deal on the game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJGPSXG4?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as it's down to $30</a> (was $40) for the sales event. This is a great excuse to check out the multiplayer shooter if you've been interested--and might be a good opportunity to convince a few friends to pick up the game and group up, too.

As one of Super Earth's defenders, it's up to you to bring the concept of Managed Democracy to worlds infested with vile alien species and marauding machines. How do you spread the good word? With guns, bombing runs, and well-placed tactical nuclear strikes deep in the heart of enemy territory. An always-online game, Helldivers 2 can be played solo or with fellow soldiers, and it receives constant updates that add new weapons to your arsenal and shiny cosmetics to collect. </p>                      </div><p>Helldivers 2 sets itself apart in the live-service game genre by adopting a novel spin on in-game currencies. While you'll regularly earn rewards from successful missions and for taking part in community events, the premium in-game currency can also be earned simply by playing the game. While it does take longer than simply swiping your credit card and buying the resources, you can get everything that Helldivers 2 has to offer if you don't mind grinding away for it. Luckily, the game's battle passes don't expire, and you can unlock what you want from it when you want it, provided that you have enough points saved up.</p><p> While it's multiplayer-only, the game's playerbase is large and active, and it's still easy to find others to play with, even over a year later. Even better, developer Arrowhead doesn't plan to stop supporting the title anytime soon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devs-arent-making-sequel-plans/1100-6535043/">as it envisions it as a forever game</a> like the legendary Runescape, so it appears Helldivers 2 will be around for quite a while.</p><h2>More Black Friday PlayStation Deals</h2><ul><li><a

<p>Last week, we heard how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> had become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-now-the-best-selling-physical-game-in-the-us-this-year">"best-selling" physical game in the US</a> of the year.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, Circana's video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has shared official chart data for this same location, confirming the new entry in the long-running series was the best-selling game on Nintendo platforms in October 2025. This does not factor in the digital sales of the title.</p>
<p>It replaced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> in the top spot, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remains in third place.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59qvhsok&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Mat Piscatella:</strong> "Pokémon Legends: Z-A ranked 2nd overall during October and was the month’s best-selling game on Nintendo platforms. It launched as 2025’s best-selling physical game year-to-date."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="508a4af33a022"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/508a4af33a022/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Circana, LLC</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by Piscatella, Pokémon Legends: Z-A placed second behind EA's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> (which also made its debut last month) in the "best-selling games" for the US in October 2025.</p>
<p>Once again, this doesn't include the digital sales for Pokémon. Further down this list was Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 in 13th place (one rank higher than the previous month).</p>

<p>Piscatella has also shared some details about Nintendo Switch 2 sales growth in this location during October 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Video game hardware spending in October grew 36% when compared a year ago, to $351M. Switch 2 was again able to offset declines across Switch (-52% versus a year ago... Nintendo Switch 2 sold 328k units in October. It is 68% ahead of the sales pace set by the original Nintendo Switch and is 3% ahead of PlayStation 4’s previous record velocity."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ARC Raiders has become the staging ground for a digital gang war backed by some of the biggest content creators in the world. The feud, which has been dubbed the ‘ARC Raiders War’ or ‘The Battle of the Bunguraiders’ has taken over the social circles surrounding ARC Raiders, with creators far and wide joining forces and urging their followers to show their support by dressing a certain way.</p>



<p>It’s a hilarious example of how engaged the community is inside ARC Raiders, the all-new and electric extraction shooter from Embark Studios. Let’s dive into the ARC Raiders War and figure out what it all means.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-arc-raiders-war">When is the ARC Raiders War?</h2>



<p>The ARC Raiders War is set to come to a head this Saturday, November 22. An immense group of streamers, featuring the likes of Myth, The Burnt Peanut, xQc, HutchMF, and Ninja, will all go live simultaneously to broadcast ‘The Final Showdown’. It will be the culmination of days of social media hype, and it’s set to take place on Spaceport.</p>



<p>If you want to watch the ARC Raiders War, you’ll need to be around and tuning into your favorite streamers at:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 pm PT</li>



<li>7 pm CT</li>



<li>8 pm ET</li>



<li>1 am GMT</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-did-the-arc-raiders-bungulators-war-begin">How Did The ARC Raiders Bungulators War Begin?</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, HutchMF was brutally downed and executed (read: <em>knocked out</em>) in ARC Raiders. He was pleading for mercy and went down screaming, vying for war against The Burnt Peanut after being taunted with the phrase ‘For the Bungulators’. </p>



<p>Hutch declared war on social media, and The Burnt Peanut quickly reciprocated. Before long, all manner of streamers were pulled into the fight, forming some sizeable teams:</p>



<p><strong>Team Burnt Peanut (The Bungulators):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Myth</li>



<li>Summit1g</li>



<li>Cloakzy</li>



<li>RNGingy</li>



<li>Shroud</li>



<li>Ninja</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Team HutchMF:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>TimTheTatman</li>



<li>Nadeshot</li>



<li>Symfuhny</li>



<li>NICKMERCS</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s quite possibly one of the most loaded community-backed roleplaying events in recent years, and it’s only growing. Even xQc has joined the story, but he’s remaining impartial and hasn’t signed up to fight for either side.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-join-the-arc-raiders-war">How to Join the ARC Raiders War</h2>



<p>If you want to represent your chosen faction in the ARC Raiders war, you can do so by equipping the following gear:</p>



<p><strong>The Bungulators:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Striker Skin: Red</li>



<li>Bag: On</li>



<li>Gas Mask: On</li>



<li>Helmet: On</li>



<li>Padding: On</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The FMF (Hutch):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Torpedo Skin: Red</li>



<li>Helmet: Off</li>



<li>Goggles: On</li>



<li>Mask: Off</li>



<li>Sleeves: Off</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to join xQc’s neutral faction, it’s just the Origin skin in <strong>blue</strong>.</p>



<p>Hutch has ‘control of the South’ of the map, while The Burnt Peanut has staked the North of the map.</p>



<p>This is one of the primary reasons why ARC Raiders continues to perform well, almost a month after its release. It’s a game that streamers can’t put down, pulling their audiences onto the platform.</p>



<p>Speranza is about to become a battlefield. Are you ready to serve in the ARC Raiders War? Let everyone know what side you’re taking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After many leaks, Silent Hill 2 Remake is finally confirmed for Xbox Series X|S. Furthermore, it’s already out to play and at half price.</p>







<p>Released in 2024, Silent Hill 2 Remake was a collaboration between Konami and Bloober Team to bring the 2001 horror classic to new consoles. Following James Sutherland, you’ll enter the fog-riddled town of Silent Hill to find your once-thought-dead wife. The psychologically twisted narrative was a hit then and even more so now, winning multiple awards and receiving praise from fans and newcomers alike. However, the game only came out for PlayStation 5 and Steam. Rumors and even a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">storefront leak</a> hinted that the remake would come to Xbox and, now, we can confirm it’s on its way and sooner than you’d think.</p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-2-remake-is-now-available-on-xbox-series-x-s">Silent Hill 2 Remake is Now Available on Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Xbox Store has <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially listed Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, confirming that it is on Xbox Series X|S. No trailer or anything has come out yet, making this a pretty huge shadow drop. Even more so, it’s appears that the game is out in full and can be bought right now. It’s Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, but is actually half off at $34.99. The game <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-2-silent-hill-f-standard-dual-pack/9MZQ9BGNL7VK/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can also be bundled</a> with Silent Hill f for $79.99.</p>



<p>As for DLC, we still don’t have a confirmation for Born from a Wish. Fans have been asking for it for quite a while, but no luck so far. Hopefully, with the game on Xbox, Bloober Team may revisit Silent Hill 2 and give Maria the content she deserves. The team is already working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-silent-hill-remake-development-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 1 remake</a>, so perhaps it would bide players over until we return to that foggy town. </p>

<p>A celebratory illustration for the Tales series’ 30th anniversary may have spoiled the next remaster. Even more so, it’s a title many fans have been vocal about since the Remaster project was announced.</p>







<p>Since 1995, the Tales series (also known as Tales of Series) has been charming players with vibrant adventures and grand action RPG combat. While not as mainstream as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-be-close-to-100gb-on-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy</a> or Persona, the Bandai Namco franchise has had a few successes in the West with Tales of Symphonia and Vesperia. Since 2021, with Tales of Arise, the series has been remastering past games like Xillia and, announced this week, Berseria. The full lineup hasn’t been revealed, but a new illustration from Ufotable may have let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-abyss-remastered-possibly-in-development-hints-anniversary-illustration">Tales of the Abyss Remastered Possibly in Development, Hints Anniversary Illustration</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">◤ Step back into the story ◢<br>The 30th Anniversary Key Visual by ufotable is now revealed ✨<br>Characters from titles celebrating their anniversaries in 2025–2026, along with characters from remastered titles, invite you into the heart of the story. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tales30thAnniversary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Tales30thAnniversary</a> <a href="https://t.co/BNcY6IfIJI">pic.twitter.com/BNcY6IfIJI</a></p>— Tales of Series (@TalesofSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/TalesofSeries/status/1991703111467958370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the post, <a href="https://x.com/TalesofSeries/status/1991703111467958370?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seen above</a>, the Tales series commemorates its 30th anniversary. The illustration, done by Ufotable (Demon Slayer), showcases all the recent Tales titles like Arise, Xillia Remastered, Graces f Remastered, and Berseria Remastered. However, one character there is from a game that isn’t a remaster, let alone announced: Luke from Tales of the Abyss. Given that the game came out in 2005, it being there is a bit interesting.</p>



<p>Tales of the Abyss was a PlayStation 2 exclusive and the eighth main title in the series. Following Luke fon Fabre, he’ll venture into the unknown to figure out his birth and escape a dangerous prophecy. Fans have been asking to see the game brought back to life for a while. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the next remaster after Berseria is Abyss, though Xillia 2 was confirmed earlier this year. Still, while it isn’t confirmation, it does give a small glimmer of hope that the PS2 title may be reborn.</p>

The PlayStation exclusive also beat <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in the same category.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4yuitok&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The Switch 2 and Switch 2 Pro Controller had also been shortlisted for "Best Gaming Hardware". This award went to AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> took out the "still playing" mobile award, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> won best self-published indie game.</p>

<p>In our review of Donkey Kong Bananza here on Nintendo Life, we awarded this title an "excellent" nine out of ten stars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whether it's smashing through the scenery with a Bananza Transformation or carefully planning a route to a hidden Banandium Gem, you'll have trouble finding more originality and, crucially, more enjoyment from a platformer in recent years. As the DK Rap so wisely said, "Donkey Kong is here." Now let's just hope he stays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some <em>other</em> award show news, earlier this week it was announced Donkey Kong Bananza was in the running for The Game Awards' Game of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it faces some tough competition, including games such as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (which is up for 12 awards at the same show), Hollow Knight: Silksong and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xqc-league-of-legends-unwatchable-esports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xqc-thinks-league-of-legends-is-an-%E2%80%98unwatchable%E2%80%99-esports-game.1360330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a recent stream, Felix ‘xQc’ Lengyel, one of the biggest streamers in the world, bagged on League of Legends esports. He stressed that the game is fine to play, but branded the esports side of things ‘f***ing unwatchable’. Instead, he backed Counter-Strike 2, suggesting that Valve’s shooter ‘clears it by a margin of like 10x or 20x’.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, xQc was an esports competitor himself, but those days are long gone. Do you think xQc is right about League of Legends esports?</p>



<h2 id="h-that-will-probably-never-change">‘That Will Probably Never Change’</h2>



<p>In a recent stream clip, xQc was captured telling his viewers that League of Legends is, in his opinion, an awful esports game.</p>



<p>This was during the Esports Awards, where League of Legends secured the award for Game of the Year, beating games like Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT to the punch. It has been a stunning year for League of Legends, with records being broken at the League of Legends World Championship event, hosted this season in China.</p>



<p>That’s not enough for xQc, though.</p>



<p>In a slight rant, xQc said on stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>CS2 will always win: It’s a game that offers good storytelling, the spectator POV is unmatched, and it’s easy to make a story. Anyone can just jump in, and they know exactly what’s going on, and that will probably never change. It’s why it’s still so successful as a title. League of Legends? </p>



<p>It’s god f**king unwatchable… It’s great to play, but it’s not a great esports game… I love League, don’t get me wrong, but Jesus, as an esports game, Counter-Strike clears it by a margin of like 10x or 20x.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/73655-xqc-i-love-league-but-as-an-esports-game-cs2-clears-it-by-a-margin-of-10x-or-20x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EScoreNews</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Counter-Strike hasn’t made the cut at the Esports Awards in almost a decade. The last time it clinched Game of the Year was in 2017, and since then, League of Legends, Overwatch, and VALORANT have all had their time in the limelight.</p>

<p>This marks the beginning of "regularly scheduled in-game events" for Kirby Air Riders, which may or may not remind you of the limited-time events in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros.

              <p>Floor cleaning splits into two separate tasks that waste time and leave you switching between vacuuming and mopping with different equipment. Tineco dominates the wet dry vacuum category by eliminating this inefficiency, and competitors haven’t caught up to their smart sensor technology that adjusts cleaning parameters automatically based on mess detection. The<strong> Floor One S5</strong> handles everything from dry debris to sticky spills in a single pass without manual mode switching or guesswork about water flow rates. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5768/"> just dropped this machine to a record low of $259 for Black Friday, down from its usual $449 price</a>, which makes this pro floor cleaning accessible at nearly half the typical cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Transforms Cleaning Intelligence</h2>
<p>Proprietary <em>iLoop</em> technology <strong>detects the level of mess and automatically adjusts suction power, water flow volume, and brush roller speed</strong> in real-time to match what it encounters. Heavy dirt automatically turns up the suction and quickens the brush speeds; light dust reduces power consumption to prolong battery life. The sticky messes get more water flow to dissolve the residue, while the dry ones get less to avoid over-wetting</p>
<p>The dual-tank system keeps the <strong>cleaning solution and dirty water completely separate throughout the process</strong>. Fresh water and cleaning solution flow from the clean tank to the brush roller, while contaminated water gets sucked into the separate dirty tank. This design ensures you’re always cleaning with fresh water rather than spreading dirty water around, like most mop and bucket systems do. The clean water tank increased 30% in capacity compared to previous generations, allowing it to cover larger areas before requiring refills.</p>



<p>The design of the brush roller places the bristles close to baseboards and into corners where dirt accumulates, but standard vacuum heads cannot reach. The edge-to-edge coverage of the roller eliminates the gap that requires you to go back with hand tools or separate edge cleaners. Floors are completely dry within minutes after cleaning, rather than remaining damp for hours like traditional mopping leaves them.</p>



<p>The <strong>hands-free self-cleaning cycle</strong> takes care of the most dreaded maintenance task with traditional mops. Press one button, and the machine automatically flushes the internal tubing and brush roller with clean water, which dislodges trapped hair, debris, and dirty water from the cleaning system. After the cleaning cycle is complete, the centrifugal drying function spins excess water out of the roller to prevent mildew growth and odors that build up in damp cleaning tools. This automated maintenance takes mere minutes with zero manual scrubbing or touching of the dirty roller.</p>
<p>The <strong>3-in-1 docking station combines storage, charging, and self-cleaning in one small footprint</strong>. The vertical storage design saves valuable floor space over maintaining a separate vacuum and mop with their accessories and cleaning supplies. The station charges the battery between uses and is the anchor for the self-cleaning cycle. The cordless design reaches all areas of your home without being tethered by extension cords limiting your range or presenting tripping hazards while cleaning.</p>
<p>The machine deals with hard floor types like tile, hardwood, laminate and vinyl without any specific attachments or changing settings. From sticky kitchen spills and bathroom grime to muddy footprints and pet accidents, all clean up with the same equipment and technique. The cleaning solution works on multiple floor types without residue or requiring specific formulations for different surfaces. Regular maintenance involves cleaning the filter and the HEPA element monthly to maintain suction performance and wiping the dirty water tank sensor to avoid false full alerts.</p>
<p>At $259, you’re getting Tineco’s flagship wet/dry vacuum technology for $190 below standard retail pricing that puts this category out of reach for many households. The 42% discount brings automated floor cleaning within budget for people tired of the vacuum-then-mop routine that doubles cleaning time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and that means that the weekend is <strong>finally here</strong>. Before you can enjoy it, you simply must complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle! Fortunately, I’ve got the hints and solutions you need to get things wrapped up as quickly as possible. If you’re stumped by today’s puzzle, simply read on for the top NYT Connections hints.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-21">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 21)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #894:</p>



<ul>

<li>TALKING DOLL</li>



<li>CHOW MEIN</li>



<li>BOUTONNIÈRE</li>



<li>SEA BREEZE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of what politicians, prom dates, or awareness campaigns might wear.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Names evoke breezes, colors, or canine companions.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>They’re the heart of beloved family films</em>.</li>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skip-gopro-this-insta360-8k-360-action-camera-drops-to-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000645958</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skip-gopro-this-insta360-8k-360%C2%B0-action-camera-drops-to-new-record-low-on-amazon.1360294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Action cameras used to be a choice between GoPro’s standard rectangular frame or settling for cheaper alternatives with questionable quality. Insta360 has emerged as a heavyweight competitor that delivers capabilities GoPro can’t match, specifically the ability to capture everything around you simultaneously in 8K resolution. The <strong>X5 records full 360-degree video</strong> that lets you choose angles during editing rather than committing to a single perspective while filming. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/"> just dropped this camera to a record low of $464 for Black Friday, down from its usual $549 price</a>, and this aggressive pricing puts serious pressure on GoPro’s market dominance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>8K 360-Degree Capture Eliminates Missed Moments</h2>
<p>It boasts <strong>dual 1/1.28-inch sensors to capture 8K footage at 30 frames per second</strong>, recording everything in your line of sight with really impressive detail and dynamic range. This omnidirectional recording means you’ll never miss the action happening behind you or to the side while focused on something else. The bigger sensor size relative to most action cameras pulls in more light and offers more excellent color accuracy across a wide range of lighting conditions. You can pull any angle from standard flat video after filming, which effectively gives you infinite camera positions from one recording session.</p>
<p>The t<strong>riple AI chip architecture will process the enormous streams of data from both sensors</strong> and at the same time applying sophisticated noise reduction algorithms. This computing power results in usable footage in low-light conditions where conventional action cameras produce a grainy, unuseable result. Night skiing, evening events, or indoor activities become viable shooting scenarios rather than situations in which you pack the camera away.</p>



<p>The invisible selfie stick effect creates impossible-seeming third-person perspectives that follow you through scenes. The camera’s software automatically removes the selfie stick from the 360-degree footage and make shots appear as if filmed by a drone or cameraman tracking alongside. This cinematic effect works because the stick occupies such a narrow slice of the<strong> full 360-degree field of view that the AI can seamlessly stitch around it</strong>. You get professional-looking tracking shots without carrying gimbal equipment or recruiting someone to film you.</p>
<p><em>InstaFrame Mode</em> automatically generates a ready-to-share flat video without requiring a full 360-degree editing workflow. The camera can auto-track your movement, keeping you centered in the frame as you move around, or lock to a fixed angle for static compositions. It lets you do this far quicker when all you want is quick social media content rather than elaborate 360 experiences.</p>



<p><em>FlowState</em> stabilization and 360-degree <em>Horizon Lock</em> eliminate the need for additional weight and complexity due to gimbal equipment. Advanced stabilization algorithms work to smooth out bumps, vibrations, and sudden movements that would make traditional footage unwatchable. The horizon lock keeps framing level even during complete rotations or dramatic angle changes. Mountain biking, skiing, skateboarding, and other high-impact activities result in smooth, professional-looking footage without the floating camera effect that electronic stabilization sometimes produces.</p>
<p>The replaceable lens design addresses the biggest weakness of previous 360 cameras where damaged lenses necessitated the replacement of the entire expensive unit. Similarly, the upgraded lenses in this device are more resistant to scratches and impacts compared to their predecessors, but when an accident occurs, you can swap them out in seconds. Such repairability significantly extends the camera’s useful life because lens damage becomes a minor maintenance issue rather than a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>This four-microphone array features advanced Wind Guard technology, capturing clearer audio when engaged in outdoor activities. Where normally wind noise drowns out voices, this system focuses on vocal frequencies while filtering out the wind interference that often ruins audio in traditional action camera recordings. This matters for vlogging, narration, or any scenario in which you’re talking while filming.</p>
<p>Waterproof construction to 49 feet operates without separate housing that adds bulk and degrades image quality. You can take the X5 swimming, surfing, or diving in shallow water without protective cases. The <strong>battery life of 185 minutes</strong> covers extended shooting sessions or full-day adventures, while fast charging reaches 80 percent capacity in just 20 minutes.</p>
<p>You’re getting cutting-edge 360-degree technology at $85 below standard retail pricing that already undercut GoPro’s flagship models for $464. The 15 percent discount brings pro 360 capture capabilities within enthusiasts’ reach who want creative flexibility beyond what rectangular action cameras provide.</p>

              <p>With modern laptops, connectivity was sacrificed for thin designs and give you two to three USB-C ports where you used to have a variety of choices in connecting your devices. This minimalist architecture now creates constant frustration when you try to hook up monitors, external drives, charging cables and peripherals all at once.</p>
<p>The <strong>14-in-1 docking station from Anker resolves this limitation by taking that single USB-C port</strong> and breaking it out into fourteen connection options that cover every device you might need to plug in. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/">just dropped this hub to a record low of $39 for Black Friday, down from the usual $69 price</a>, which makes essential connectivity affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Triple Display Expands Your Workspace</h2>
<p><strong>Dual 4K HDMI and a 1080p VGA port</strong> enable three-monitor setups that transform how one works with multiple applications and documents. You can dedicate one screen to email and communications, another to active work, and a third to reference materials or monitoring dashboards. The 4K resolution on HDMI outputs brings sharp text and detailed images, which help reduce eye fatigue during extended work sessions. The VGA port keeps compatibility with older projectors and monitors that businesses and conference rooms still use frequently. Windows users get true <strong>extended desktops across all three displays</strong>, while macOS mirrors the same content to all connected monitors due to operating system limitations.</p>



<p>The <strong>five USB-A ports</strong> accommodate legacy devices like external hard drives, printers, webcams, and wired keyboards that haven’t yet moved to USB-C connections. The 5 Gbps transfer speed will handle file operations well, transferring gigabytes of data in minutes, not the glacial speeds of older USB 2.0 hubs. <strong>A dedicated USB-C data port adds another high-speed connection</strong> for newer devices while matching the same 5 Gbps throughput. That matters when backing up large photo libraries, transferring video projects, or syncing substantial data sets between devices.</p>
<p>The p<strong>ass-through charging of 80 watts powers</strong> your laptop through the hub while using all connected devices. You plug your laptop’s USB-C charger into the hub’s power input, and the hub distributes power to your laptop while maintaining all connectivity functions. This single cable solution means your laptop charges while accessing all peripherals without juggling multiple power adapters.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet port</strong> ensures solid wired network connections that avoid unreliable Wi-Fi in crowded offices or when maximum upload and download speeds matter. Wired connections eliminate the latency spikes and bandwidth competition that wireless networks introduce during video calls or large file transfers. The consistent throughput supports remote desktop sessions, video conferencing, and cloud backup operations that demand reliable connectivity. The <strong>SD and microSD card slots</strong> handle camera cards and storage expansion without separate card readers cluttering up your desk. The <strong>AUX port</strong> connects wired headphones or external speakers, preserving audio quality that Bluetooth sometimes compresses.</p>
<p>Compatibility extends to USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt-equipped laptops running Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, or macOS 12 and newer. The hub expects that your laptop’s USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alt Mode for video output and Power Delivery for charging functionality. Most modern business laptops and MacBooks boast both features, although some budget laptops with USB-C ports omit the required protocols.</p>
<p>For $39, you’re getting professional docking station functionality at almost half the $69 standard price that already undercut dedicated docking solutions costing $150 or more. The 43% discount brings essential connectivity to remote workers and office users who’ve struggled with inadequate laptop ports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League has launched a new TTRPG crowdfunding campaign. The new game, <em>Twilight Sword</em>, is inspired by classic videogame RPGs and is the latest collaboration between the publisher and the developers of the high-octane experience, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-publishing-partnership-for-cinematic-ttrpg-outgunned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Outgunned</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Twilight Sword</em> Backerkit Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/two-little-mice/twilight-sword" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Twilight Sword</em> is a fantasy TTRPG that draws heavy inspiration from <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preview-return-to-eden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a>, and the art style of Studio Ghibli. The game has players exploring the world of Radia, a land that is under attack by the forces of evil and despair. Heroes will do this not just by fighting monsters, but by rekindling hope through acts of courage and selflessness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/twilight-sword-champion-artwork.jpg?itok=GDZ2O9Pz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/twilight-sword-champion-artwork.jpg?itok=fH4tb8sJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The campaign includes three different books. The Core Rulebook contains the rules for both players and GMs to play. <em>The Lands of Radia</em> book fleshes out an original fantasy setting full of monsters, villains, and quests for players to undertake. Lastly, there is a starter set for people curious about the game but don't have much time or money to commit to a full purchase.</p>

<p><em>Twilight Sword</em> uses an original gameplay system called CAT, or Created at Twilight. Skill rolls are resolved with a d12 roll tied to one of a character's eight skills. If the d12 result is equal to or lower than that skill's number, you succeed. Natural 1s are critical successes; natural 12s are critical failures.</p>

<p>Other features of the game include a Hope/Despair mechanic. Hope is built up when characters perform selfless or kind acts, which can dispel Despair, which protects strongholds controlled by the bad guys.</p>

<p>In addition, it will include a high level of character customisation. Each character picks one of two Ways, which gives them unique perks and feats, and one of five playable Kin, such as human, catperson, and penguin.</p>

<p>The pledge levels for <em>Twilight Sword</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Wanderer for $41:</strong> PDF copies of the core rulebook, <em>Lands of Radia</em> supplement, a PDF starter set, and a PDF card chest</li>
	<li><strong>Starter Set for $46:</strong> A physical and digital Starter Set, and a set of Twilight Dice</li>
	<li><strong>Core Rulebook for $52:</strong> A physical and digital copy of the core rulebook</li>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-shows-no-pride-silently-offloads-galaxy-watch-7-at-nearly-50-off-via-amazon-2000645949</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartwatches compete based on health tracking accuracy and ecosystem integration, and Apple Watch remains on top despite premium pricing starting at $399 for the latest Series 10. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 brings similar health metrics, AI-powered insights, and advanced sleep tracking at a fraction of Apple’s cost, and Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/"> just dropped it to a record low of $129 for Black Friday, down from its $249 retail price</a>. That nearly 50% discount undercuts even older Apple Watch models, but you get hardware that Samsung quietly released earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI Powers Personalized Health Insights</h2>
<p>The <strong>Energy Score calculates your daily physical readiness</strong> by analyzing yesterday’s activity, sleep quality, heart rate patterns, and recovery metrics. This AI-driven analysis tells you if your body is prepared for hard work or needs lighter activities and rest. The score updates every morning, based on the data collected during the night, providing actionable information before you plan your day’s training. <strong>Samsung’s AI analyses that data</strong> on the paired phone rather than in the cloud, keeping health data private while providing personalized recommendations. Over time, the system learns your patterns to fine-tune accuracy while gathering more data about your unique physiology and response to different levels of activity.</p>
<p><strong>Performance tracking provides real-time comparisons</strong> of your current run or bike ride to past sessions, showing exactly where you’re maintaining, improving, or falling behind your pace. It’s that real-time feedback that lets you dial in your effort during a workout, rather than finding out later that you underperformed. The Galaxy AI removes movement artifacts from the heart rate signals of exercising users, improving the accuracy in cases where an individual’s arms are swinging or vibrations impact sensor contact.</p>



<p>S<strong>leep tracking follows your rest cycles</strong> and detects patterns that show poor sleep quality or probable health issues. For example, the watch identifies light sleep, deep sleep, REM stages, and periods of wakefulness throughout the night with accuracy that rivals dedicated sleep tracking devices. From there, Samsung’s AI analyzes the data to provide recommendations for improving sleep hygiene, adjusting bedtime routines, or modifying evening habits that interfere with quality rest. The sleep apnea detection feature screens for moderate and severe cases by monitoring breathing disruptions and oxygen levels during sleep.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provides<strong> personalized recommendations from the advanced health data</strong> your watch gathers all day. Its AI looks at patterns of activity, stress levels, and sleep quality, along with heart rate trends, to identify areas in which small changes may help optimize overall wellbeing. Such advice isn’t just about general fitness; it comments on real-life behavior and physiological responses unique to each person. The system may recommend earlier bedtimes when it observes accumulated sleep debt, advise stress management techniques during especially tense weeks, or encourage one to move more on days when mostly sedentary.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm case size fits smaller wrists comfortably</strong> without the bulk larger smartwatches create. Bluetooth connectivity keeps a stable connection to your phone for notifications, calls, and data syncing without requiring cellular service that adds to monthly fees. Battery life extends through a full day and night of continuous health tracking, though exact duration varies based on which features you enable and how often you interact with the watch.</p>
<p>Samsung’s ecosystem integration works seamlessly with Galaxy phones but <strong>also functions with other Android devices and even iPhones</strong>, though some features require Samsung hardware for full functionality. The watch face customization options let you prioritize which health metrics appear prominently, adjusting the display to show the data you actually care about rather than generic layouts.</p>
<p>At $129, you’re getting Samsung’s latest smartwatch technology at nearly half the price of entry-level Apple Watch models that don’t offer comparable AI-powered health insights. For those who have been priced out of the smartwatch market by Apple’s premium positioning, this 48% discount brings flagship health tracking within reach.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-22tb-external-hard-drive-drops-60-amazon-clears-stock-for-black-friday-2000645970</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-22tb-external-hard-drive-drops-60-amazon-clears-stock-for-black-friday.1360252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage subscriptions will drain your budget month after month and leave you dependent on internet connectivity to access your own files. The Seagate 22TB HDD offers enough capacity for massive photo libraries and years of accumulated digital content in one device, and Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/">just dropped this drive to a record low of $229 for Black Friday</a>, and while that compares to a typical $249 price, <strong>this same drive sold for $599 until just days ago</strong>. That represents a 60% discount from the price you’ve seen throughout the past year and the lowest this capacity has ever cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22TB Eliminates Storage Anxiety Completely</h2>
<p>The h<strong>uge 22-terabyte capacity stores around 5,500 hours of HD video, 5.5 million high-resolution photos</strong>, or 440,000 songs at resolutions without compression or quality loss. With this much space, you can keep everything instead of making painstaking choices over what to delete or archive. Professional photographers maintain RAW file libraries spanning entire careers without resorting to cloud services. Video editors store entire project files complete with all source footage, renders, and iterations available instantly. It<strong> handles 4K and even 8K video projects</strong> that consume hundreds of gigabytes per hour of footage.</p>
<p><strong>USB 3.0 connectivity delivers transfer speeds up to 5 Gbps</strong> under ideal conditions; you could be moving large files in minutes, not hours. The real world, of course, will vary depending on the USB implementation on your host computer and the drive’s mechanical performance, but sustained transfers of about 100-150 MB per second for sequential file operations are within reason. This speed manages general backup tasks efficiently without tying up your computer for extended periods. Transfers of large files, such as moving an entire photo shoot or backing up a video project, complete within reasonable time frames.</p>



<p>Seagate includes <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> that provide professional data recovery should the drive fail mechanically or suffer logical corruption. This service covers the cost of laboratory recovery attempts that cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars if you were to buy them separately. It’s the peace of mind when you’re storing family photos, work for clients, or a lifetime of creative work on a single device.</p>
<p>The plug-and-play design instantly works with Windows and Mac computers, requiring no software installation or complicated setup procedures. It means that Windows will immediately recognize the drive and assign a drive letter to it, ready for use. If you are a Mac user, you can easily reformat it to APFS or HFS+, although it will ship formatted for compatibility right out of the box.</p>



<p>The drive’s performance suits cold storage and archival purposes where you are writing data once and reading it occasionally, rather than running active databases or applications. Time Machine backups on Mac or File History on Windows work perfectly with this drive’s speed characteristics. Media servers streaming video to local network devices perform well since the sequential read speeds handle multiple concurrent streams.</p>
<p>Yes, this means that at $229, <strong>you are getting 22 terabytes of storage for just a little over $10 per terabyte</strong>. That is exceptional value that was not around at this price until now. The 60% discount from the $599 price that prevailed until recently brings enterprise-scale storage capacity to consumer budgets. This Black Friday deal has space enough to consolidate several smaller drives, cancel cloud storage subscriptions, or simply stop worrying about storage limitations for several years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-pro-drops-40-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-home-lighting-2000645934</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-pro-drops-40-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-home-lighting.1360234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting takes your home’s exterior from drab to dramatic without the tacky holiday-only vibe some cheap string lights create. The Govee <em>Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro</em> serve as sophisticated daily accent lighting that switches to festive colors when the occasion calls while maintaining architectural elegance-never screaming seasonal decoration-all year long. This <strong>200-foot system features 120 individually controllable RGBIC LEDs</strong> for ample coverage at most homes and color flexibility to match any mood or event. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">just dropped this complete system down to a record low of $459 for Black Friday, down from its usual $759</a> which makes professional architectural lighting accessible at nearly 40% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Delivers True White Light</h2>
<p>The upgraded warm white and cold white capabilities differentiate these lights from cheaper RGB alternatives which tend to produce muddy, off-color whites. Color <strong>temperature ranges from 2700K to 6500K</strong>, from cozy warm candlelight tones to crisp daylight whites matching your home’s existing exterior lighting. Each LED produces 50 lumens for real illumination, not a dim decorative glow that makes you run additional lighting. This level of brightness works for daily accent lighting that highlights architectural features, pathway illumination, or subtle perimeter lighting that enhances security without harsh floodlight aesthetics.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design creates a triangular lighting effect that directs light out but doesn’t blind anyone who looks directly at the fixtures. This optical engineering prevents the harsh glare that makes cheap LED strips uncomfortable to be around. The light spreads evenly along your roofline or architectural features without hot spots or dark gaps between LEDs. Enhanced lens technology keeps color accuracy high across the entire RGB spectrum and improve the white light quality that most outdoor lighting actually uses.</p>



<p>The cuttable and extendable design allows you to tailor the installation to your home’s exact dimensions rather than deal with excess cable or come up short. You can cut the strand at designated points and reconnect sections with waterproof joints every 16.4 feet. This flexibility accommodates complex rooflines, multiple buildings, or layouts that require wrapping corners and spanning gaps.<strong> Up to 200 feet of connected length</strong> can be supported in the total system, covering substantial properties without needing multiple separate systems.</p>



<p><strong>Water submersion up to 1 meter is protected by the IP67 waterproof rating</strong> on the adapter and the lights themselves, while the control box is IP65 for heavy rain and snow. These <strong>lights will survive from -4°F to 140°F,</strong> and cover most extremes of temperature that any climate will see in the course of a year. The 50,000-hour lifespan equates to roughly 17 years of daily use at 8 hours per day, eliminating concerns over frequent bulb replacements or system failures. In fact, this durability justifies this permanent installation approach, as the lights really do last several years, rather than needing seasonal replacement like temporary holiday decorations.</p>
<p><strong>Installation takes about 8 seconds per light</strong> with the included VHB adhesive and mounting clips that attach securely to eaves, soffits, or trim. The system recommends placing lights 2 to 4 inches from the wall surface to develop the optimum lighting effect and to prevent shadows. Waterproof splice connectors join sections together without exposed wiring or weak points where moisture could infiltrate.</p>
<p>The Govee Home app gives you individual control over each of the 120 LEDs, allowing you to create custom patterns, gradients, and effects flowing along your roofline. You could program schedules that automatically turn lights on at sunset and off at midnight, or create scene triggers that respond to weather conditions or special occasions. <strong>Of the 75 pre-programmed scene modes, holidays, seasons, and moods</strong> are already set up and don’t require you to manually select colors or design patterns.</p>
<p>At $459, you’re getting permanent architectural lighting for $300 below the standard retail price that puts this system out of reach for many homeowners. The 39% discount brings professional installation-quality results to a price point typically occupied by temporary seasonal decorations that last one or two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-november-2025-reanimal-trailer-free-demo-2000645835</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-saw-12-games-during-the-latest-xbox-showcase-and-some-of-them-definitely-have-my-attention-now.1360228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s November Xbox showcase didn’t have any major reveals but it did have plenty of nice surprises. Most of them were all geared around making the now $30 Game Pass Ultimate subscription seem a little more worth it thanks to a slew of promised upcoming day-one releases. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgOiQPxEF-I">The livestream</a> confirmed that <em>Dave the Diver</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/slot-machine-horror-steam-cloverpit-balatro-2000631009">recent Steam hit <em>CloverPit</em></a> are now both available on Xbox, each with new DLC coming early next year. But it also offered updates on a bunch of stuff that’s not out yet, including trailers for some new games we didn’t previously know about. Here’s all of them:</p> <h2>The <em>Godfall</em> studio is making a third-person roguelike shooter</h2>  <p>Counterplay games confirmed it’s <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-godfall-dev-counterplay-games-quietly-closed-down">not closed</a> and has actually been hard at work on its upcoming game <em>Armatus</em>. The very <a href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297"><em>Remnant</em>-looing</a> action game has you wandering around the ruins of Paris and facing off against demons following a mysterious, urban-fantasy-coded cataclysm. The run-based game will have you collecting upgrades and experimenting with different powers. Hopefully, it can marry <a href="https://kotaku.com/next-gen-launch-title-godfall-really-really-wants-you-1848149707"><em>Godfall</em>‘s excellent combat</a> and neat visuals to a more rewarding progression loop. It’s coming out in 2026 and will be day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>The next wave of <em>Silksong</em>-likes is coming with <em>Crowsworn</em></h2>  <p>2D action platformer? Check. Metroidvania world? Check? Plague Doctor-inspired hero? Check. It’s impossible to tell if <em>Crowsworn</em> has the goods from the gameplay trailer alone but there are secrets to find and loadouts to optimize as you kill enemies in front of stylish scene art. There’s no release window but it’s also day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2><em>Erosion</em> promises isometric action in a glorious voxel art world</h2>  <p>It’s a Western-themed, time-warping sandbox. Every time you die, you respawn 10 years in the future. The world around you changes and evolves in the meantime. A really neat idea helped by a really neat aesthetic. It looks like you’ll be exploring different towns and making choices that affect the future, too. It’s headed to Xbox Game Preview on PC in spring 2026 with a console launch to follow.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Echo Generation 2</em> looks like a promising sequel</strong></h2>  <p>The first <em>Echo Generation</em> was a humble little <em>Stranger Things</em>-style adventure that took inspiration from games like<em> Paper Mario</em>. There was turn-based combat, puzzle solving, and the occasional narrative-driven quick-time event. This time it looks like you’ll be propelled into a cyberpunk future fighting evil robots with a <em>Gremlins</em>-esque sidekick. It’s coming “soon” but doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>

 <h2><strong>Multiplayer horror gets a period piece</strong></h2>  <p><em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulu</em> is a co-op horror game that has players exploring a Lovecraftian haunted coastline in the colonial era. They’ll have to navigate “shifting perceptions” to survive and find treasure. This one’s out summer 2026 and <em>not</em> coming to Game Pass on day-one.</p>

 <h2><strong>Indie darling <em>Raji</em> levels up&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p><em>Raji: Kaliyuga</em> is a sequel to Nodding Heads Games’ 2020 action adventure. It swaps the isometric perspective for a full third-person view and adds Raji’s brother Darsh as second playable character for a story that leans even deeper into mythology. The blue cat monkeys are the big highlight of the cinematic trailer reveal, though we haven’t really seen gameplay yet. It’ll be on Game Pass but there’s no release date yet.</p>

 <h2>The wait for <em>Reanimal</em> is almost over</h2>  <p>The upcoming horror game from the original <em>Little Nightmares</em> developers got a new trailer, a release date, and a demo. The co-op adventure arrives February 2026 and its first demo is out today. Not surprisingly, the price to bag this one was too high and it won’t be a day-one Game Pass release.</p> <h2><em>Roadside Research</em> looks like <em>Supermarket Simulator</em> with aliens</h2>  <p>You’re still stocking shelves, still checking out customers, and still trying to stay in business. Except this time you’ll also be wearing disguises and trying not to raise the suspicions of the local populace that you’re actually from another planet.&nbsp;<em>Roadside Research</em> aims to engineer some co-op comedy in addition to the smooth-brained satisfaction of succeeding at capitalism. It’s coming Q1 2026 to Game Pass.</p> <h2><em>Tides of Annihilation</em> has some wild boss fights</h2>  <p>This one gave me big “<em>Harpy fight from Final Fantasy XVI</em>” vibes, in a good way. <em>Tides of Annihilation</em> is playing loosely off of the King Arthur mythology but mostly just seems interested in figuring out how it can mash up cool combat ideas from other flashy dark fantasy action games. The lack of a coherent visual identity probably won’t matter too much if the combat and boss fights can stay on point. Still no release date, unfortunately.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Total Chaos</em> is out today</strong></h2>  <p>The follow-up to <em>Turbo Overkill</em>, about surviving creepypasta horror come to life, was shadow-dropped today on PC and console. It’s also on Game Pass. It looks way darker than its neon-fueled predecessor.</p> <h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em> turns into a 3D pixel art dungeon crawler</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a> might be too good to play. Like, I’m seriously afraid to actually pick this one up once it’s out lest it consume all my free time against my will. Unlike the top-down first game, this one is a deck-building roguelike that seems to weigh strategy more than RNG. Mostly it just looks cool as heck.</p> <h2>Furry May Cry</h2>  <p><em>Zoopunk</em> also looks cool as heck. It’s set in the same universe as <em>F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch</em> and looks like someone learning to use Unreal Engine mashed together <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Star Fox</em>. Unfortunately, it’s also leveraging <a href="https://kotaku.com/zoopunk-generative-ai-demo-trailer-xbox-showcase-2000645874">some generative AI tools</a> to let players craft and customize user-generated content in the game.</p>
