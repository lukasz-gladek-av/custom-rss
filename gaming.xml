            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-just-like-moving-little-guys-around-a-map.934908/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over my years in this job, I've been forced to focus my interests and hone my critical thinking about not just individual games themselves, but the genres they exist within. If you're going to write about games for a living, you need to get better at picking them apart! A big part of that process recently has been taking my love of strategy games and trying to figure out <em>why </em>I love strategy games.</p><p>There's obvious stuff here, stuff I could have expressed years ago, stuff that any armchair fan of <em>Civilization </em>or <em>Total War</em> or Paradox could also tell you. I like playing video games set in historical time periods. I like board games, so turn-based strategy games in particular are a passion of mine. I'm a slow, considerate, solitary gamer, and few genres are as slow and considerate as strategy.</p><p>But there has to be something <em>more</em>, right? Just what is it about those games that really lights a fire under me? What's compelling me once the setting wears off and I stop seeing pikemen and just start seeing units, 1s and 0s? What's making me like one strategy game set in the 16th century and not liking another?</p><p>These are questions I've been asking myself a lot lately, through reviews and re-reviews, and while playing <em>Order of Battle</em> last week, I think I finally nailed it. Yeah, I like planning moves. But I like actually moving the guys more. </p><p>There's nothing better in <em>Civilization </em>than the early periods when I'm actively exploring and founding cities, or going to war--moving guys around--and there's nothing worse than those long periods where I just mash "end turn" because there's not much else going on (i.e., no guys to move around). <em>Crusader Kings</em> has buttons to speed up time for a reason: every second I'm not moving armies around or making decisions, I'm not living my best medieval life. Meanwhile tactics games like <em>XCOM</em>, where you're <em>always </em>moving guys around? Great!</p><figure></figure><p><em>Order of Battle</em> has slowly made this all clear to me because, as one of my guiltiest of pleasures, it's a game I've spent <em>hundreds </em>of hours with over the years. As a turn-based WW2 tactics game it's not the most realistic in the field, nor does it have the most cunning AI. What I've realised it does better than any other turn-based tactics game like this though--maybe any other strategy game, period--is let you move guys across a map.</p><p>Its campaign maps are <em>huge</em>, and you've got a lot of guys at your disposal. Sometimes you get to move them in really complex and interesting ways, like naval invasions, where you have to move ships and planes and <em>then </em>land the guys, after which you can move the ships and planes <em>and </em>the guys. Other times you're just moving <em>fast</em>, sending armoured columns deep inside enemy territory, your own front lines bulging on the map as you go. As I found myself playing one of these maps last week, clicking and clicking and clicking, I realised I had more fun moving little guys around in a failed attack than I had planning a successful one. </p><p>The act of selecting then moving units is just a blast. Pushing seven infantry units into a meatgrinder should be a tragedy, but it's not, it's great. Feigning a retreat then smashing the over-exposed pursuers? Oh buddy, you better believe that is a hoot. There is such an immense, tactile pleasure in selecting some guys, clicking on the map and watching them scoot off. Most of them have a little animation while doing so, and make a little noise as they vroom around.</p><p>It was an honest but also confronting realisation; here I was, devoting much of my professional career and personal downtime to a genre of game that I was...maybe playing wrong? Or at least not as intended? I was supposed to be here for the plans, not the guys.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Unity of Command II -- Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH38X4yro64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>With it's toy-like unit design, Unity of Command II is another excellent "Move Some Guys" game</figcaption></figure></div><p>This pleasure of picking a guy and playing with them, a digital facsimile of the joy people get painting a miniature, or having hurling an action figure around as a child, or building a model railway set, or [stop me before I say something even more tragic], is of course not unique to turn-based strategy gaming. It's common in real-time strategy too;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBqdKGiqnI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Wololo wormed its way into a generation's brains</a> not just just because it's a funny word, but because you had to click on the guys thousands of times. Which felt good, and <em>never got old</em>.</p><p>From chess to RISK, many of the most beloved and popular board games of all time involve moving guys. Tabletop wargaming has much the same appeal--pick up some guys, move them somewhere--<a href="https://kotaku.com/hg-wells-practically-invented-modern-tabletop-wargaming-5944058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it's been around for over a century</a>, itself derived from the apparent pleasure Generals of old used to get hunched over sandtables and campaign maps, drawing arrows and holding their chins in their hands while sending men to their deaths.</p><p>There's precedent, then, but it still doesn't explain <em>why</em> this is fun. Most examples I listed above are abstracting the art of generalship, ostensibly a deadly and murderous pursuit, which makes them equally unsavoury and weird. War is not fun, far from it, so why are artificial recreations of its movements such a good time? Again, I don't know, but the fact it's a pleasure to paint arrows on a map but hell to stab a man through the heart with a bayonet <em>might</em> explain why so many wars of the 17th-20th centuries were planned and executed by men (relatively) removed from the battlefield's more immediate dangers.</p><p>Whatever the underlying reasons for my joy here--whether it's tactile or just the satisfaction of seeing a plan play out--I think it's funny. Strategy games are supposed to be a brainy pursuit, a genre where thoughtfulness and meticulous planning are the entire point. The action is just the planning playing out. Yet here I am having the most fun just clicking on some guys, moving them around and sometimes, just sometimes, whispering "beep beep outta my way, tanks coming through" as they go "vroom" across the map. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204422/wooting-razer-snap-tap-socd-beta-feature<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, Razer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194977/razer-snap-tap-mode-huntsman-v3-pro-wooting-rappy-snappy">beat Wooting to a speedy new keyboard feature</a> that lets players counter-strafe more quickly in a variety of competitive PC games. Now, Wooting has implemented the same feature.</p><p>Normally, to switch strafe directions in a first-person shooter, you have to fully release one key before pressing the other. If both are pressed, they cancel each other, and you stand there like a dummy for a moment until you release one of the keys.<strong> </strong>Professional players have mastered not overlapping A and D keys to get perfect counter-strafing and movement in games, but with Razer’s Tap Snap and Wooting’s new Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (SOCD) beta, you don’t need to release a key and can rapidly tap the A or D key to counter-strafe with little to no effort.</p><p>Wooting has also been working on a similar feature called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100819/wooting-80he-keyboard-rappy-snappy-feature">Rappy Snappy</a>, which works a little differently. Rappy Snappy takes advantage of Wooting’s Hall effect switches and prioritizes keys based on how far down they’re pressed, so it’s not the same as the last-pressed priority SOCD feature that Razer has branded as Snap Tap. While Wooting had <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">initially resisted SOCD</a> in favor of its own approach, it’s now offering both options for its keyboards.</p><p>Wooting’s implementation of SOCD is actually better than Razer’s, offering <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/blogs/support/what-is-socd">different resolutions</a> and the ability to have both keys active at the same time if that feels a little more natural to you. </p><p>Snap Tap, or SOCD, is already proving to be controversial among <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em> players. “Razer’s new keyboard is basically cheating,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFeny5bs2JCg">claims YouTuber optimum</a>, who does a great job of explaining how Snap Tap and Wooting’s SOCD beta work. <em>Counter-Strike</em> creator MrMaxim also <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHnjvBpPIFiw">points out</a> that Snap Tap can even help you achieve longer jumps, and it also helps you pull off “wall bugging” where you hug diagonal walls to prevent fall damage.</p><p>“Shouldn’t be allowed,” says professional <em>Counter-strike 2</em> player ropz in a <a href="https://x.com/ropz/status/1811135734843376086">post on X</a>. “Nice work but this is a bit too much, literally a macro / script, otherwise known as null binds.” PC players have used null binds to prevent you from pressing two opposing directions for years, in scripts that can be loaded into games or macros that can be assigned to keys. Null binding is typically banned in tournaments. Razer’s senior esports ambassador, Jimmy Malavong, was <a href="https://x.com/JimmyMalavong/status/1811138752603115807">quick to respond</a> to ropz’s concerns, noting that the company had spoken to tournament owners.</p><p>The debate around this feature looks set to continue in the weeks ahead, and it may end in games just implementing null binds to let anyone achieve this without having to buy a Razer or Wooting keyboard.</p><p>If you’re an owner of a Wooting keyboard you can grab the update that includes Rappy Snappy and this Snap Tap-like SOCD feature through the company’s <a href="https://beta.wootility.io/">beta Wootility software</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Red Art Games, a publisher based in France known for games like Have A Nice Death and Nuclear Blaze, has been hit with a major cyber attack.</p>



<p>The company <a href="https://x.com/RedArtGames/status/1815748815485350034/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted an official statement</a> online Tuesday afternoon confirming the attack, confirming that customer data was involved in the breach.  In order to keep customers safe, the studio also took down their website “for the time being.”</p>



<p>“The Red Art Games website has just undergone a cyber attack, and will be offline for some time until the situation is sorted out,” the studio said in a statement. “Unfortunately, our customers’ data has also been exposed during the attack. The people responsible may attempt to leverage the stolen data for fraudulent purposes.”</p>



<p>Red Art Games says that people should be “very vigilant” if they get emails or any sort of contact from someone claiming to be from the studio. </p>



<p>“We want to ensure you that the bank information are safe and hasn’t been impact by this cyberattack and we highly advise you to change the password that was used for your Red Art Games account,” they said.</p>



<p>While they recover from the attack, the studio says all shipments, order changes, and refunds will be paused for the next few days. More updates on the situation will be available “in the days to come.”</p>

It makes the boss fights significantly harder with new abilities and "legendary actions" (which D&amp;D players will know well), and it makes some of the rules a bit stricter, especially around action economy. And, of course, it restricts you to a single life and prevents you from reloading your old saves--if you die once, you have to start all the way over.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For those of you who want the extra difficulty without the brutal permadeath requirement, Patch 7 will allow you to turn on the optional Honor Mode mechanics in a Custom Mode playthrough. It's a nice addition for those of us who enjoy a challenge, but don't have the time or inclination for that full commitment. Patch 7 will also add the much-anticipated "evil endings" to the game, as well as a mod manager, revamped split-screen gameplay, and a variety of small changes. The patch doesn't have a firm release date yet, but its closed beta will launch later in July.</p>

                <p>SAG-AFTRA has authorized its chief negotiator to potentially call for an immediate strike because of a controversy surrounding the use and treatment of AI voices in video games. Union leadership has made it clear in recent statements that they regard AI as a significant issue in the voice-acting space, and that a strike is potentially in the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">Per a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, the large union is currently in the process of renegotiating the Interactive Media Agreement, the contract that many major companies in the gaming industry abide by when making big-budget games. The hypothetical revised version of the agreement would include stronger AI protections, safety precautions for on-set performances, and higher wages.</p><p dir="ltr">The union said that some employers have pushed back on some of the AI provisions in the new draft. In response, SAG-AFTRA authorized its national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland to call an immediate strike if they don't reach an agreement soon. "If called, the strike shall be over all covered services under the Interactive Media Agreement and all SAG-AFTRA members will cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the IMA," the press release reads in part.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1815480189163651375" rel="nofollow ">posted a message</a> of support in response to the press release, stating that the company "supports" SAG-AFTRA's view that "game companies shouldn't receive generative AI voice-training rights on dialog recording sessions." Whether or not such training rights require an additional clause or contract is one of the key issues that the agreement will have to tackle.</p><p dir="ltr">SAG-AFTRA has mulled a strike for video game actors over the AI issue for the better part of a year now. Back in 2023, the union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actors-strike-looking-more-possible-bargaining-talks-apparently-going-nowhere/1100-6517812/">called for a vote</a> to authorize a strike if necessary, and in January of this year, several of the organization's members <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/">criticized</a> a newly inked deal with an AI voice studio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-1-update-5-1-1-out-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hello Games has released a new patch for its latest major No Man’s Sky update, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-adds-major-world-improvements/">Worlds Part 1,</a> addressing issues raised by the community. The update addresses issues such as players becoming invisible, worlds becoming infested which destroyed settlements, and crash issues related to planet rendering.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Worlds Part I Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7-9Bf47yfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issues that caused the player to become invisible after jumping and shooting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the player to be positioned 50m off the ground when riding some synthetic lifeforms.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused some planets to become infested, resulting in a loss of any settlements on that world, and in minor terrain shifts. The infested status of planets has been restored to how it was pre-Worlds. Newly infested planets will become un-infested, and previously infested planets will be restored as such.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to planetary rendering.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare rendering crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a rendering hang.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Worlds Part 1 update is a near universal refresh for No Man’s Sky. The overhaul of water and cloud rendering has been comprehensive. Water now operates on a mesh system, enabling the creation of more realistic waves and foam, while cloud coverage in the sky differs between planets and respond to weather conditions. Rain will not occur without sufficient cloud cover, and wind patterns and storm effects on flora and fauna will be more true-to-life.. The variety of skies, influenced by the colours of day and night, will reflect the unique atmosphere of each planet. The universe of No Man’s Sky is now sprinkled with new frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive, and toxic worlds.</p>
<p>Hello Games will continue to update No Man’s Sky, addressing bugs and also work on the development of Worlds Part 2, as well as<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/hello-games-light-no-fire/"> the procedural adventure game Light No Fire.</a></p>

			<p>Play by Play Studios is a brand-new the-world gaming studio created by studio veterans such as Scott Probst, former GM of Visceral Games, Mike Young, former Creative Director on Madden, and Art Director Terry Smith, who worked on the first God of War as an AD. As of today, they are coming out of the woodwork to announce their first game to be released.</p>
<p>The first game to be developed by Play by Play Studios is The Run: Got Next. In this game, you play 3v3 basketball, and you can either play solo or online with friends and other competitors. Dripping in street hoop culture, this game features fast-paced decision-making where you can either be a mediocre basketballer or become "the G.O.A.T."</p>
<p>The game has yet to receive a full release date, but it is planned for sometime in 2025. Its cartoonish art style is full of vibrancy and excitement, and players can try out signature dunks, tricks, monster blocks, and more.</p>
<p>As listed on the official Steam page, "multiplayer meets roguelike," as the difficulty scales with the matches, and there are modifiers that can make or break your perfect basketball streak. Court conditions, modifiers, and drops can impact how your game pans out, and every single run you undertake is different.</p>
<p>The Run: Got Next features a stylized look to each court that you can play on, with some of them being the most famous and popular basketball courts across the globe. The characters, courts, and all of the movements are hand-keyed animations, giving the game a tremendous amount of love and care put into it. The game is entirely hand-crafted, with every pixel of the game being unique to the players.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2866670/The_Run_Got_Next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The teaser trailer</a> introduces players to three playable characters from The Run: Got Next. They all have unique moves and stylized dunks to add a bit of flair. Even in just the three characters showcased, there is a ton of variety, and it gives players a glimpse at the potential for a fun but chaotic adventure on the basketball court.</p>

<section><p>Warbands and Hero Talents will be evergreen features going forward, instead of expansion-exclusive one-offs.</p></section>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, The War Within, is right around the corner, and it's looking to build on the success of Blizzard's back-to-basics approach for 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-review-who-says-you-cant-go-home/1900-6418011/" data-ref-id="1900-6418011">Dragonflight</a>. That means a focus on evergreen features that will persist for years to come in The War Within, the first chapter in a three-expansion trilogy Blizzard has dubbed The Worldsoul Saga.</p><p dir="ltr">Two of The War Within's biggest additions, Warbands and Hero Talents, are great examples of Blizzard's current approach. Rather than entirely new features, each system is instead building on what came before. Warbands is the full realization of all the alt-character-friendly changes and account-wide unlocks that have slowly made their way into the game over the past few years and that became even more of a focus in Dragonflight. Hero Talents, meanwhile, are an expansion of the well-received class Talent tree revamp introduced in Dragonflight, which itself was a throwback to the Talent trees from the game's earliest days.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within Cinematic Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">On paper, iterations on existing WoW features don't quite sound like game-changing, back-of-the-box additions that sell expansions, much less the expansion that will kick off a storyline that is intended to serve as the culmination of WoW's first two decades. But any WoW player with multiple characters will tell you how exciting, and transformative, a feature like Warbands will be to the long-running MMORPG. That enthusiasm applies to Hero Talents as well, as the feature will finally allow players to live out class fantasies like becoming a Dark Ranger as a Hunter or engaging in mounted combat as a Rider of the Apocalypse Death Knight.</p><p dir="ltr">With the arrival of Warbands alongside the game's The War Within pre-patch (which goes live today), gone will be farming reputation or renown on multiple characters. Currencies will be able to be moved freely between characters. Players will finally be able to add various weapon and armor appearances to their account regardless of whether the class they are using at the time is able to use those items. Warbands will display characters across realms on the game's login screen. It will also allow for the transferring of items between characters on the same account regardless of realm, thanks to additions like the Warband bank. Even on just a visual level, having characters on a player's account displayed all together, as opposed to being separated by which server they housed on, is a welcome change.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW is finally becoming a simpler and more-seamless experience for those who have multiple characters spread across multiple realms and factions. It's a big change--one that started to come together in earnest as Dragonflight shipped--said WoW principal software engineer Peter Hodge in a recent interview with GameSpot.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there really was a genuine desire to keep pushing," Hodge said. "Dragonflight had a lot of really great improvements to evergreen systems and a lot of quality-of-life things…We wanted to continue that philosophy. What else is there in World of Warcraft that is due for a fresh look? We certainly get feedback all the time that those quality-of-life things around making playing alts easier or access to account-wide features, [so they were] definitely very high on the list… It feels about the right time to bring a lot of those ideas under one umbrella of a feature."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337302-wowwarbandui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337302-wowwarbandui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337302"></a><figcaption>Warbands enable account-wide progression across characters, displayed all together on a new character select screen.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337302-wowwarbandui.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Such an undertaking wasn't exactly simple, however. WoW is a 20-year-old game, and even if many elements of its underlying code are newer, it's still a massive and complex undertaking to make fundamental changes to how characters, items, and accounts have always worked.</p><p dir="ltr">"The reality is, especially when you're dealing with something like the inventory, you're dealing with bits and pieces of that or features of that which have a very long history," Hodge said. "None of it was written with the idea of 'Hey, what if this was account-wide?' No one thought about that when they were laying down the foundations of the inventory code 20 years ago or longer. That certainly becomes one of the biggest challenges from an engineering perspective."</p><p dir="ltr">For Hero Talents, which aren't coming with The War Within's pre-patch but will be part of the expansion proper, it was a different sort of challenge: how to expand the well-received the Talent tree system from Dragonflight without overwhelming players with choices or complexity. It's for that reason Blizzard decided on the idea of 10 additional Talent points able to be invested in a single separate tree, with each specialization able to choose between two of each class's three new Hero Talent trees. At max level, players will have the entirety of their chosen Hero Talent tree unlocked, as opposed to the normal class Talent trees, where players are forced to make some choices about their build and don't have enough Talent points for everything. George Velev, a producer on WoW, said the team liked having a "definitive package" for each Hero Talent tree.</p><p dir="ltr">"We find that the current Talent tree offers a lot of options for players entirely, adding 10 more options; 10 more points you had to pick between probably felt like it was skirting a little bit too much towards too complex," Velev said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though each Hero Talent tree does feature some choice nodes where players pick between two abilities, the fact that each Talent tree is largely the same across all players of that spec makes each easier to fine-tune and balance, Velev said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every Sunfury Fire Mage is going to have these 10, give or take a few choice nodes, for their kit," Velev said. "So we fundamentally know we can balance that against Spellslinger or that against Frostfire. That gives us a lot of tools in our arsenal for making sure when you do come to a decision of 'should I play X or Y,' it's more of a focus on the thematics and fantasy and what appeals to you instead of just picking between what's stronger and what's weaker."</p><p dir="ltr">That "class fantasy" of each Hero Talent tree is a big part of the appeal. Some of the new Talents draw on existing archetypes for many of the Hero Talent specializations. Hunters will be able to follow in the footsteps of Sylvanas as a Dark Ranger, while Monks will have the option of embracing the teachings of Pandaria's Shado-Pan. Other Talents put an emphasis on less-explored aspects of a particular class, like exploring the prophecy side of Priests or the ancestral-spirit ideas present in Shaman lore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337300-wowwarwithinherotalents.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337300" data-ratio="0.56253505328099" data-width="1783" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337300-wowwarwithinherotalents.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337300"></a><figcaption>Each class specialization will be able to choose between two Hero Talent trees.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337300-wowwarwithinherotalents.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Many of the Hero Talent specs that pull from existing lore are also rooted in a particular faction or group. Warrior's Mountain Thane Hero Talent tree, for example, is a dwarven archetype, but one that will be usable by all Fury and Protection Warriors, not just dwarves. It was a design challenge that took a lot of time and brainstorming to get right, Velev said.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the most part, we went with what felt most appropriate for the class," Velev said. "Yes, there are a lot that are sort of faction-specific, but we tried to avoid a lot of faction connotations. We know a lot of players don't want to play something that's very Horde or very Alliance, in which case we tried to make sure that's not the only option for them. But we also didn't completely remove stuff that felt too faction-specific from the table entirely because at the end of the day, Dark Ranger Hunter is super cool. Yes, it's a little bit Horde-oriented but just because it's Horde-oriented doesn't mean we should give up on that approach or that direction."</p><p dir="ltr">Hero Talents have drawn some criticism from players over the fact that the idea of playing as a Dark Ranger might be the best option for their class specialization, but might not fit their particular class fantasy. The opposite is also true; a player may have always really loved the idea of being a Dark Ranger and all that entails, but the spec in theory might not be optimal for specific types of endgame content, discouraging them from playing the spec. Velev said the team wants players to feel like they can swap Hero specs should one tree perform better than another at a specific type of content. He also said that Hero Talents are an evergreen feature and that balance changes and iteration will continue into The War Within and beyond.</p><p dir="ltr">"What we want to avoid is every single time you play your Hunter you feel like you can't play Dark Ranger at all," Velev said. "There are trees that are optimized for specific scenarios and that's sweet. That's awesome. But feeling like you can never play what you want to play… That's something we're trying to avoid. And that's why we have things like you get every single Talent point, so we can have more opportunities to make sure they are as tightly balanced as possible."</p><p dir="ltr">While every expansion is a major turning point for WoW, The War Within in particular feels like a fundamental change for the MMO. One prominent WoW content creator has gone as far to call the expansion's upcoming pre-patch <a href="https://youtu.be/yB1SsRGaMMk?si=7dPNZuUcvNB7ts5_" rel="nofollow ">"the most important Warcraft patch ever."</a> That might be a little clickbaity, but there is truth in the fact that once the account-wide systems that make up Warbands are unleashed, there's no going back. WoW will fundamentally be played differently come The War Within. The changes have been a long time coming (one might even call them overdue), but it seems as if Blizzard is finally keeping pace with how its players consume WoW in the modern age, doubling down on the idea that players want to play more characters, not fewer.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot more players play a lot more characters than they did in the dawn of World of Warcraft," Hodge said. "That's been a gradual change over time. That was definitely a big part of the reason why we thought 'Hey, we need to be looking more at making this easier for players.' Certainly, as an outcome, as a goal, if we get more players trying more classes in World of Warcraft…if we can provide more options and excitement for players to jump into more alts, for me that will be a win."</p><p dir="ltr">WoW: The War Within launches on August 26. Those who purchase the game's $90 Epic or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-collectors-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6522721/">20th Anniversary Collector's Edition</a> will be able to play three days earlier on August 23. The War Within pre-patch, which adds Warbands and Skyriding for most flying mounts (another feature iterated on from Dragonflight), is live today.</p>

            <p>
Amid of swirl of rumours suggesting Microsoft was prepping more Call of Duty for an imminent Xbox Game Pass release, the company has confirmed last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will join on its subscription service this Wednesday, 24th July.
</p>
<p>
As per Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/23/modern-warfare-3-coming-to-game-pass-july-24/">announcement</a>, Game Pass subscribers will have access to all Modern Warfare 3 modes, meaning its single-player campaign, multiplayer, and open-world Zombies.
</p>
<p>
Modern Warfare 3 is only the second <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> title to hit Game Pass since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the company</a> last year, with Diablo 4 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">launched for the subscription service</a> back in March. It's not the only announced Activision title for Game Pass, of course; this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">available to subscribers</a> when it arrives on 24th October.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Newscast: Does the loss of day one launches make Xbox Game Pass pointless?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEc8ghseTIk?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Or rather, it'll be available to <em>some</em> Game Pass subscribers in October, given Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">recent overhaul</a> of the service. As of 12th September, Game Pass' basic catalogue tier - now known as Xbox Game Pass Standard - will no longer provide access to first-party and other titles on launch day. That benefit will instead only be available to subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, with all tiers getting a price increase.
</p>
<p>
Modern Warfare 3's imminent Game Pass arrival is presumably timed to get as many new subscribers onboard ahead of September's price hike in the hope they'll stick around. Whether or not this particular Call of Duty will do the trick remains to be seen - Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell didn't think much of it last year, calling it an "exercise in extracting value from its players rather than providing it" and "what happens when this industry is at its worst", in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review">two star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-roadmap-officially-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA Sports WRC, also known as EA WRC, is a highly popular racing game and holds the license of the World Rally Championship, which allows them to make these games. Developed by Codemasters, EA Sports WRC is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-tech-q-no-plans-to-add-lumen-or-nanite/">the Codemasters first rally game</a> to have the official WRC license. Released in November 2023, EA has officially released the roadmap for EA Sports WRC, so that players and fans of the game can see what they should expect.</p>
<p>A new season expansion has officially been confirmed for October 2024, adding plenty more content to the game. The expansion is set to include "new locations, rally stages, high-performance vehicles, liveries, and more." Fascinatingly, those who purchase the season expansion for EA Sports WRC 2024 will also go on to receive two more additional DLC packs post-launch.</p>
<p>Along with the season expansion, players can purchase the EA Sports WRC 2024 Season Edition, a one-time purchase of both the base game and the three incoming DLCs for a fixed price.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc/news/2024-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the blog post</a> for the EA Sports WRC roadmap, EA expands on that and says that a further season expansion will be released in Winter 2024, with the other being released in Spring 2025. Those who purchase the season expansion will receive the other two DLCs at no extra cost. Alternatively, those who don't own the expansion can purchase the DLCs individually.</p>
<p>The blog post for the WRC road map also confirms the introduction of the Season 6 Rally Pass, which begins on July 30. Utilizing player feedback, the developers have made the Rally Pass more reasonable, allowing players to unlock liveries for cars outside the WRC. With the new Rally Pass, Moments are also returning to the game. The Rally Pass will be entirely free for players to utilize and try to unlock all of the rewards available.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting points of the blog post is the reveal of esports WRC. While it is still in development, the blog post says, "We're almost ready to share the official competition information and event calendar as we continue to work with our partners on the finer details of the series."</p>
<p>While the details haven't been released yet, they say to stay tuned to their social media accounts, where you will find out the latest information regarding the online qualifiers that are to be held via RaceNet, and a later in-person final race where players will compete for the title of esports WRC World Champion. The races will have a variety of challenges and locations for players to compete in, and they all have to use Rally1 cars to compete.</p>

<p>Play by Play Studios has announced its new basketball game, The Run: Got Next. The game comes from a studio featuring numerous former EA developers, including former general manager Scott Probst, Madden creative director Mike Young, and more.</p>



<p>The game is being touted as a spiritual success to the NBA Street franchise of the early-to-mid 2000s. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Run: Got Next - Official Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vmq1zu8u0OU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“There was a lot of us that worked on NBA Street that always wanted to bring it back. I think it is difficult for a company that has a game like a Madden or an NBA Live that is so big. If you’re putting all your resources to that, I think it was challenging to think about a secondary game,” Young told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-street-the-run-got-next-unreal-engine-5-ps5-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p>



<p>“Introducing&nbsp;The Run: Got Next&nbsp;– a character-driven, full court 3v3 hoops game that celebrates the attitude, style and skills of streetball culture,” the <a href="https://playbyplaystudios.com/news/introducing-the-run-got-next" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s description reads</a>. “Bring your squad to some of the most legendary street courts around the world and see how long you can go on a Run.”</p>



<p>In a welcome note <a href="https://playbyplaystudios.com/news/welcome-to-play-by-play-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the studio’s website</a>, Probst says that the goal of the studio is to bring fun back to sports games in a way that doesn’t exist anymore.</p>



<p>“As the years have gone by the gaming industry has grown exponentially, and in many cases the business has taken precedence over the fun of a particular experience – that sucks,” he said. </p>



<p>“I’ve found this myself in many sports games today where I feel like I have to grind hundreds of hours to be good, I have to pay hundreds of dollars (on top of the $70 I already spent for the game itself) to have an ok time, and I have to go out on random quests to do things that don’t really have anything to do with the fun of the game or the sport.”</p>



<p>The Run: Got Next launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

        <p><em>Modern Warfare III</em>‘s multiplayer offers crisp and responsive gameplay across a bevy of maps and modes. All the classic maps from the original <em><a title="Games > Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a></em> (2009) make their return, but with new gameplay improvements that players have become accustomed to over the years. This, in addition to the large-scale Invasion and Ground War maps and four seasons’ worth of post-launch maps and updates, means that you’ll be getting an incredible amount of content right from the jump. There’s never been a better time to hop into the fray!</p><p>Player progression has evolved as well, with new and familiar Perks, Killstreaks and Equipment to unlock. Each level builds you into a stronger and more tactically diverse operator, giving you more options on the battlefield. In addition to your usual weapons and attachments, MWIII also introduces After-Market Parts, allowing you to further customize your weapons. And if you’ve played MWII multiplayer, MWIII allows you to transfer much of your content and weapon progression with its Carry Forward feature.</p><p><strong>Explore the Dark Aether</strong></p><p>Prepare to fight and survive against hordes of zombies in the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever! In this co-op PvE extraction mode, you and your squad drop into the outskirts of an infested Urzikstan as a part of Operation: Deadbolt. As you complete contracts, raid strongholds and venture further into the map, the zombies you encounter will grow stronger and more relentless. The best loot and darkest secrets hide in these higher-tier areas, but you will still need to safely exfiltrate if you hope to keep your gear and fight another day. Luckily, you’ll have access to many classic Zombies upgrades including Perk-a-Colas, Ammo-Mods, the Pack-a-Punch machine and (if you’re lucky) the powerful and infamous Wonder Weapons.</p><p>However, there are more than just zombies roaming this infested area. The mercenaries of Terminus Outcomes have set up bases around Urzikstan along with their elite Warlords. Oh, and have we mentioned the special zombies and bosses? There’s much more to discover, but we’ll let you find out for yourself.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Xbox Game Pass Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Play Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III with Game Pass on July 24" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azOmcIVpj6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to<a href="https://x.com/HYPEX" rel="nofollow "> Hypex</a>, a well-known Fortnite content creator, both skins will come with individual items and be cell-shaded, much like the Daredevil skin.

Given that the film is scheduled to release later this week on July 26, it's safe to assume that players will be able to purchase them sooner rather than later.
