		<p>Square Enix has set the date and time for the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game reveal. Tune in next week on Tuesday 20th January at <span dir="auto">10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET for the Life is Strange reveal livestream.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Life is Strange Returns in 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2eHeCKYHJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The blurb on the YouTube trailer just reads “Separate the real from the rumor… Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game.” However, the more enticing fact is that the placeholder page is titled “Life is Strange Returns in 2026.”</p>


<p>Unfortunately for Square Enix, Life is Strange: Reunion was leaked last week by the PEGI ratings board. The synopsis for the game on the now removed listing read “Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.”</p>
<p>Sounds pretty familiar, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>The Life is Strange series has been in the hands of Deck Nine for a good few years now, with the IP held by Square Enix and original developer Dontnod branching off to other projects since Life is Strange 2. Having bounced between new protagonists and settings, Deck Nine brought us back to Max Caulfield’s story with 2024’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/">our review</a>, Reu said, “Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a very easy game to recommend. If you have enjoyed previous games in the series, this is doing enough of the same to scratch that same lowkey mystery vibes itch. The ability to shift between timelines can become a touch overwhelming at times, but there’s several things in place across the UI, accessibility options, and narrative flow to keep the gameplay smooth. What’s more, I think this game might have redeemed Max Caulfield for me too, so take that how you will.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this month, a group of masked thieves wearing anime backpacks and brandishing hammers and a gun ran into a New York City card shop and then smashed and grabbed over $100,000 worth of merchandise, including Pokémon cards, from the store.</p> <p><a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/pokmon-shop-robbed-100000-merchandise-armed-burglars-manhattan/18404893/">As reported by <em>ABC7</em></a>, police are currently investigating the armed robbery involving three masked individuals that took place at the Poke Court card shop in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District on January 7. An employee told the outlet that the thieves threatened everyone in the store as they smashed glass doors to access Pokémon cards and other related merch. According to the employee, the robbery happened suddenly and took only three minutes. Police arrived after someone called 911 and reported the robbery.</p>

  <p>There were around 40 customers in the store when the three armed robbers entered and started smashing up the place. They were there as part of the Poke Court’s first community event. The shop opened in November 2025.</p>

 <p>Poke Court owner Courtney Chin said that she has a detailed list of what was stolen and is hoping insurance will cover the loss. According to the owner, the store does have alarms, but she is unsure if they worked properly and plans to talk to her security company for more information. Chin is also contemplating hiring an armed guard to help protect the store.</p>

 <p>“That’s been the recommendation of the police and of other shops in the area to get an armed guard or like a doorman,” Chin told <em>ABC7.</em></p> <p>This isn’t the first armed robbery targeting Pokémon cards and merch. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666">We’ve seen many other card shops</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241">robbed by thieves</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-stolen-charizard-attack-crime-1851778231">over the last two</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-cards-theft-250-store-stolen-robbery-rare-minne-1848569785">years as Pokémon cards</a> continue to grow in value and the demand for them skyrockets.

<p>The time of New World: Aeternum is coming to an end. </p>



<p>After it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-development-cancelled-amazon-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no new content was coming</a> to the game and that it would be taken offline after 2026, Amazon Games has given an update as to when New World: Aeternum will go dark.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-new-world-come-down">When Will New World Come Down?</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Thursday, Amazon Games announced that New World: Aeternum will be taken offline on January 31, 2027. From that point on, no one will be able to continue playing the game.</p>



<p>With this announcement also comes the news that as of today, January 15, the game will be delisted and no longer available for purchase. If you already own the game, you can still play it and reinstall it as much as you want until the January 31, 2027 date arrives. </p>



<p><strong>“We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” </strong>they said. <strong>“We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</strong></p>



<p>The end of New World comes after its development team was hit with layoffs back in October. At the time, the layoffs spanned across all of Amazon, including its game studios and Twitch.</p>







<p>It has been our pleasure to work on&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum</em>&nbsp;and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the writing already on the wall in red paint after the confirmation that no new content would be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/new-world-aeternum">New World: Aeternum</a> after the current season, it’s now been confirmed that Amazon’s MMORPG will be shutting down in January 2027. The game is also being delisted today and is no longer available for purchase.</p>
<p>In a farewell message alongside the announcement, the team writes, “<span>We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</span></p>


<p>The game server shutdown is scheduled for 31st January 2027, and with the game being delisted from sale today, that means a full year’s notice is being given before service is removed for the game. Additionally, Marks of Fortune, the premium in-game currency, will be removed from sale on 20th July.</p>
<p>Because you’ll still be able to play the game, and as a kind of “why not?” the Nighthaven season will be extended through to the very end, however this game is just being left to sail into the night. There won’t be any content changes, and even as the player base inevitably dwindles, there also will not be any further server merges. The only exception is that they will monitor bugs and performance issues.</p>

<p>New World’s failure is pretty significant. The game arrived with a huge bang in 2021, as Amazon brought its fantasy colonialist MMORPG to PC, racing to a huge peak of over 900,000 concurrent players that pushed the servers beyond the limit. After such a strong start, the playerbase (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>) dwindled through early 2022, but enjoyed a new peak of over 130,000 for the first yearly expansion. Perhaps a lot of expectation was put internally on the potential of the console port, which arrived with a major game overhaul last September in the form of New World: Aeternum, but on PC at least, the game has spent much of 2025 with daily peak player counts below 10,000, jumping up to 50,000 with the new Nighthaven update.</p>
<p>However, since the announced end of new content updates, the player count has understandably fallen to new lows. It last cracked the 2,000 player mark on 7th December and has been around 1,300 the last few days.</p>
<p>I’m sure plenty will log in for one last hurrah next January, just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/12/anthem-has-now-gone-offline-forever-servers-get-shutdown/">as was done for Anthem</a> in the last few days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="7c4444b503b2e"><a title="Switch 2 amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c4444b503b2e/switch-2-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there was one name I wasn't expecting to see crop up in the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal Direct, it was <del>Kirby Air Riders</del> amiibo.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Ultimate</a> and its DLC fighters had propped up the amiibo release schedule for the best part of five years, and its conclusion lined up so neatly with us all boarding the Switch 2 hype train that I couldn't imagine a better way to tie a bow on the toys-to-life fad, albeit roughly 15 years later than the rest of the industry.</p>
<p>But no. If the first six months of Switch 2 have taught me anything, it's that amiibo are here to stay. Nintendo seems determined to keep pushing these things out, and they're coming at a frankly staggering cadence — we've had <em>13</em> newbies enter the fray since the console's launch, with another five already slated for this year (plus that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-amiibo-list-every-animal-crossing-zelda-smash-bros-street-fighter-metroid-mario-donkey-kong-amiibo#minerus-construct">Mineru's Construct</a> model that everyone seems to have forgotten about).</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cenyuksr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>My shelf space can't keep up, but I've got to respect the grind. The figures themselves keep getting more and more detailed, and with additions like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Air Riders</a> collection and its swappable components, Nintendo is still innovating on an increasingly expensive product that I assumed was firmly in the rearview.</p>
<p>The big question, then, is where have all the bright ideas gone when it comes to the figures' in-game unlocks? I'm not going to pretend that amiibo's scannability has always been its biggest draw, but are you really telling me that in the year of our lord 2026, a short Metroid jingle is considered a valid scan reward? Come on.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4f19029c3489f"><a title="Kirby Air Riders amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4f19029c3489f/kirby-air-riders-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Alex Olney / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a bugbear that has been brewing for a few months now. Nintendo was pleased to announce that the pricy new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> amiibo (launching six months after the game, might I add) unlock a Life Mushroom or a 1-Up Mushroom when scanned — because <em>those</em> are hard to come by in the base game — while other figures in the collection cough up a few measly coins. And as cool as the Kirby Air Riders range is, who <em>really</em> wants to use it to train up a league of computer racers?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> amiibo gave you a head start with the Diva Dress before you unlock it as standard at the end of the game, but every other relevant figure unlocked <em>a lump of terrain</em>. You can see my point here.</p>
<p>Yes, amiibo unlocks have often felt inconsequential at best, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-all-paraglider-fabrics-full-list-locations-how-to-change">Paraglider Fabrics</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a> gear, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-8-deluxe-amiibo-unlocks-mii-costumes-all-compatible-amiibo">Mii racing outfits</a>, and those <em>stunning</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker</a> pixel sprites all felt like a neat little 'thank you' for picking up the new figure. Dropping £24.99/$39.99 on a Rosalina model for a 1-Up feels like a slap in the face.</p>
<p>But hey, at least features aren't being locked behind amiibo purchases in the Switch 2 era. That's a reli— oh wait.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> arrived with three new amiibo to boot. Scanning the Sylux figure instantly unlocks a special flashback cutscene otherwise accessed only by getting 100% completion (scan entries and all), and that's the least grating of them. Both the new Samus and the Samus &amp; Vi-O-La amiibo unlock features that, if it were up to me, should have been in the game right from the jump. What do you mean, bike skins and an in-game radio are only available to those who have coughed up an extra £40/$70? Those feel like the kind of features that it would have been nice for everyone to play with, no?</p>
<p>The best part is what happens when you scan other Metroid figures into the game. In a move that even makes Galaxy's gold coins look attractive, whacking another amiibo onto your Joy-Con in Prime 4 rewards you with... you guessed it, a tiny little jingle! Oh, to be a fly on the wall during <em>that</em> amiibo integration meeting.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a093da535aef4"><a title="Metroid Prime 4 amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a093da535aef4/metroid-prime-4-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Nice radio you've got there, Samus — <em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only example that feels like it's hitting the right balance in the Switch 2 generation so far is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, where scanning relevant amiibo will unlock unique ball designs based on that character. It's a paraglider fabric-level of inconsequential, but it's a nice touch — albeit one that isn't tied to any <em>new</em> amiibo (that we know of).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> is in a similar boat, now that I think about it. Tapping basically any Zelda or Splatoon amiibo gives you the chance to invite one of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update">ver. 3.0</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-zelda-and-splatoon-villagers-all-compatible-amiibo">crossover Villagers</a> to your island. It's a little on the 'locking content behind amiibo side', perhaps, but the unlock is tied to so many different figures that I find it easier to overlook.</p>
<p>It's a tightrope that all amiibo have to walk, and I don't know that I can see the exact tipping point. Lean too far one way, and you fall into the trap of scan rewards feeling pointless; too far the other, and you start locking neat features behind yet another paywall — and lord knows Nintendo has had enough pricing drama this generation already.</p>
<p>Rewards should be attractive, but not so desirable that the base game feels marginally worse without them. Inconsequential, but not downright boring. It's a classic rock-and-a-hard-place situation for Nintendo where the 'rock' is a Disappointed Jim and the 'hard place' is an Angry Jim, but both Jims are a part of the problem because they'll pay the entry fee every time. Gosh, trying to please gamers must <em>suck</em>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6d84f2078c6f5"><a title="Street Fighter amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d84f2078c6f5/street-fighter-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I hope that the upcoming 2026 releases can strike that sweet spot. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> are all getting in on the fun, each with a mystery unlock of their own, while Nintendo itself has the aforementioned jumbo Mario Galaxy figures, another three Kirby Air Riders racers, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-reveals-three-more-super-mario-wood-block-amiibo-sets">My Mario wooden blocks</a>, and <em>presumably</em> the Mineru's Construct amiibo lined up in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>I'd like to think that the latter will give us something sweet, like a new weapon skin in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a>, or fresh Auto Build designs in Tears of the Kingdom, but I'm braced to hear a chirpy Direct announcer gleefully read the line “scanning Mineru’s Construct amiibo in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment for the Nintendo Switch 2 will refill your Zonai battery charge once per day!”</p>
<p>All of those yet to come will look delightful, no doubt about it, and knowing me, I'll probably end up buying some of them, too. I just hope that purchase isn't tinged with the guilt that I've just spent 25 quid on a Power-Up Mushroom.</p>

            <guid>1407442</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just a few days after renowned game designer <strong>Chris Avellone</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that <strong>Bethesda</strong> didn't truly understand the <strong>Fallout</strong> franchise, the lead developer of <strong>Team FOLON</strong> (the studio that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-has-sent-multiple-builds-to-gog-and-is-waiting-for-the-green-light-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched <strong>Fallout London</strong> in July 2024</a>), <strong>Dean Carter</strong>, <a href="https://www.esports.net/news/industry/fallout-london-creator-bethesda-elder-scrolls-vi-fallout-5-gta-london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Esports.net</a> that he feels Bethesda should sell off their IPs (Fallout and also <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong>). His dissatisfaction stems mainly from the writing of the most recent games and from the release of Fallout 76, which obviously didn't cater to single player fans.</p>



<p><em>With the greatest respect to Bethesda, I feel like they’ve probably gone one game too far, if I’m honest. I feel like it’s time to go off into the sunset and look at selling off your IP because people like the franchise, I’m just honestly not sure it’s in the right hands, and it really hurts me to say that because I love Bethesda.</em> <em><strong>The writing has just gone downhill</strong>. I know as a company, they have to try new things, but Fallout 76 caters to an audience, but it doesn’t cater to the people who want to play a single-player Fallout game. </em></p>



<p>However, Carter does add that if Bethesda could add some talented writers to their team, their next games could still be great.</p>



<p><em>I think if they’re gonna stay on board, they can stay with what they’ve got. I don’t think Skyrim is the best game of all time, like some people. It’s a very, very good game. I just feel like they need to improve the writing, I really do. <strong>I reckon if they could inject in the quality of some good writers, then the next Elder Scrolls game will be great and the next Fallout game will be great</strong>, but they need better writers, honestly.</em></p>



<p>The TEAM FOLON lead then said he's 'worried' Bethesda will keep using the <strong>Creation Engine</strong> in future games, although he clarifies it's not actually a bad engine:</p>



<p><em>I understand that it is proprietary. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of pluses to it. I’m not just someone that’s going to sit there and lie and say it’s a terrible engine. It could be better, yes, but it’s not a bad engine but I do think it started to show its age. It needs to be overhauled somewhat.</em></p>



<p><em>If they can overhaul it, then there’s no reason why they couldn’t push its limits and start adding things like drivable cars, maybe even metro systems like what we built in Fallout: London. I mean, if we found a way, I’m sure they could bring some of this stuff back into Fallout 5.</em></p>



<p>After the successful release of Fallout London, Team FOLON has registered as an official game developer and is now working on a new indie project built on <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>. However, they'll still release the last two planned Fallout London DLCs: Last Orders and Wildcard.</p>



<p>As for Bethesda, in a recent Fallout 3 retrospective, Studio and Production Director at Bethesda Game Studios <strong>Angela Browder</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-dev-speaks-fallout-3-pre-release-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the pre-release skepticism following their acquisition of the IP was, to some degree, freeing. Needless to say, the team has absolutely no plans to follow Carter's suggestion <span>to sell their prized franchises and is instead doubling down on them, with <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong>&nbsp;next in</span> the pipeline. Given the studio's track record and the fact that their previous game, <strong>Starfield</strong>, launched in September 2023, a debut between late 2027 and 2028 seems likely. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A strange countdown clock. Missing games and weird glitches on Steam. Cryptic comments from Todd Howard. The end of <em>Fallout</em> season two fast approaching. All of this is feeding into an ongoing belief among many <em>Fallout</em> fans that long-rumored remasters of <a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346"><em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em></a> are coming soon. But how much of this is true, and how much is just out-of-control hype from fans hungry for a new entry in the series?</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/a-steam-glitch-convinced-some-fallout-fans-a-new-vegas-remaster-was-imminent-only-to-have-the-rug-yanked-out-from-under-them-slowly-turning-into-r-halflife/">As reported by <em>PC Gamer</em> on January 14,</a> <em>Fallout</em> fans on Reddit noticed something odd with <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and <em>Fallout 3.</em> When trying to leave a review, Steam would block it and say the games weren’t out yet. Considering the games have been out on PC for closer to 20 years than I want to admit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcc9xg/both_fallout_new_vegas_and_3_are_experiencing/">this confused people</a>. It also fueled the ongoing belief that a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster, as well as a possible <em>New Vegas</em> remaster, are launching in the near future. People theorized that this was some backend snafu related to Bethesda getting ready to shadow-drop both remasters soon.</p>

 <p>And then someone noticed that if you search for <em>Fallout</em>, Steam lists 12 games, but there are actually only 10 games currently available. Curious! This further convinced a lot of people who frankly didn’t need much convincing to begin with that<em> Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vega</em>s remasters were coming in hot.</p>

 <h2>Debunking the<em> Fallout</em> remaster theories</h2> <p>But let’s slow down and throw some cold water on all of this.&nbsp; First, the issue with being unable to review games on Steam despite them already being released, while strange, isn’t related to any upcoming remaster. Instead, it was an issue that has affected various Steam games over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1qcb7ak/this_is_a_first_for_me/">past 72 hours or so, including <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>.</a> It also seems like it has been fixed. I was able to leave a review for<em> Fallout: New Vegas,</em> no problem.</p>

 <p>As for the 12 <em>Fallout</em> games listed but only 10 being actually available on Steam, this is a common quirk on Valve’s storefront and often happens as a result of various editions and versions of games being available or not available depending on your region. For example, looking up <em>Call of Duty,</em> Steam lists 25, but there are only 24 on the franchise page. So I wouldn’t read too much into this piece of evidence either.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660210">©Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, before Steam glitches and oddities got <em>Fallout</em> fans freaking out, there was all the hubbub about Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> countdown clock. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-new-vegas-remaster-3-amazon-s2-show-bethesda-announcement/">As explained by <em>Polygon</em></a>, Amazon recently activated <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">a website that features a <em>Fallout</em>-like map</a> with different locations. Clicking on them lets you explore these places via 3D and 2D tours. It’s neat, but what caught people’s attention is that one location is locked and won’t open until the season two finale of <em>Fallout</em> airs on February 4. It didn’t take long for people to connect the dots between this date and some past comments from Todd Howard explaining that Bethesda is working <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">on more <em>Fallout</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">that he thinks the shadow drop of <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>was a successful test.</a></p>

 <p>But once again, I’ve got some cold water to pour on all this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1q7ru1e/fallout_s2_interactive_website_final_location_and/">as according to one Redditor</a> who dug into the data of the Amazon site, the locked location is just the Lucky 38 Casino, and when the clock runs out, players will be able to explore it like the other spots on the map. That’s not to say that nothing else will be announced or revealed after the finale, but don’t expect that locked spot on the site to turn into a portal leading to <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em>.</p>

 <h2>All the evidence that <em>Fallout 3 </em>R<em>emastered</em> is happening</h2> <p>Okay, so is there any actual evidence of a <em>Fallout 3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster? Or is it all just fan hype and rumors? Well, there is some hard proof that at least a <em>Fallout 3 </em>remaster is in the works.</p> <p>First up, in 2023, a remastered version of Bethesda’s popular wasteland RPG was listed in a leaked court doc that got out during the <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">FTC vs Activision/Xbox hearing.</a> That doc listed other unannounced games, including <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and a <em>Doom</em> prequel, both of which did launch, though later than planned. So it seems very likely that, yes, <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> is a thing, and it is being worked on as we speak.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fallout 3 Remaster, Ghostwire Tokyo Sequel, Dishonored 3, Oblivion Remaster, Doom Year Zero appear on a release schedule list<a href="https://t.co/xttFBM30wp">https://t.co/xttFBM30wp</a> <a href="https://t.co/A1sv7TAuL7">pic.twitter.com/A1sv7TAuL7</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1703996755560546707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette">In November 2025, <em>VGC</em> further corroborated</a> the leaked doc and confirmed it had heard that, yes, <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> was real and is currently being developed. The site didn’t share any other details, but did suggest this remastered version of the RPG will be similar to last year’s <em>Oblivion Remastered.</em> So I expect the original engine will still be running under some fancy new Unreal-powered visuals.</p>

 <p>As for a <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> remaster? Well, there’s not really much evidence for that beyond <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/fallout-3-is-getting-a-remaster-after-all-and-new-vegas-is-too-but-thats-not-what-the-tv-shows-countdown-timer-is-for">pure speculation and some supposed leakers and insiders teasing it.</a> And while I know a lot of people would love both <em>FNV</em> and <em>Fallout 3</em> to be remastered, I can’t imagine both happening at the same time and both launching on the same day. That just seems too outlandish and would have likely leaked by now, especially if it is happening sooner rather than later.</p> <p>So, that’s where we are at. <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> is basically a confirmed real game that is happening, but we don’t know when it will launch, though it could be this year. Meanwhile,<em> Fallout</em>: <em>New Vegas Remastered</em> is more of an internet-created rumor that could happen one day; in fact, it probably will happen, but for now, it remains a pipe dream. So in short, everybody calm down, stop checking Steam for weird bugs, and enjoy the last few episodes of <em>Fallout</em> season two.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fatal-fury-cotw-s2-trailer-ai-snk-saudi-arabia-2000660224</link>
            <guid>1407430</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Even before its release in 2025,</span><i><span> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</span></i><span> has faced controversy. The revival of the long-dormant </span><i><span>Fatal Fury</span></i><span> series came after publisher SNK was purchased by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, and it’s suffered from accusations of sportswashing ever since. Now, SNK and </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> are getting called out for releasing a trailer full of alleged AI slop.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, SNK released a trailer for </span><i><span>Fatal Fury: CotW</span></i><span>’s upcoming second season, which launches on January 22. The trailer promises a pretty robust release schedule for the game’s anniversary with monthly character drops over a six-month period. Returning characters Kim Jae Hoon, Nightmare Geese, Blue Mary, and Wolfgang Krauser are slated to join the game’s roster, too. However, the excitement of fan-favorites returning has been almost entirely overshadowed by the game’s latest trailer incorporating apparent AI-generated clips.</span></p>

  <p><span>“I’m stepping down after this trailer, I’m thankful for what you guys did for us and all but this is too much for me to deal with, this is against what I stand for,” a moderator </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spicysauce.bsky.social/post/3mchxy2n7uc2d"><span>wrote in their parting message to the official Discord server</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s easy to see why. The AI stuff is just really, really ugly. The shots of cities feature skyscrapers with the most inconsistent windows I’ve ever seen, and something about the character introduction clips just looks…very off. (It’s almost like SNK knew the clips looked bad because half of them are overlaid with big walls of text and graffiti-like flourishes.)</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz/app.bsky.feed.post/3mchxy2n7uc2d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiamudluymmnrigb3heteb3bgpjx2ajjvyjb5abgxtw34tfzpgipwa"> <p lang="en">i was a SNK moderator for 6 years and official Cotw Discord for a year, this trailer made me step down after all those years, i don't / i can't promote a product that i don't support,thanks for all of those years friends, it was fun 🫡 bsky.app/profile/wari…</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz?ref_src=embed">Spicy Sauce (@spicysauce.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz/post/3mchxy2n7uc2d?ref_src=embed">2026-01-15T16:11:59.809Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>It also just seems wildly inconsistent with the game itself. </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> has a pretty vibrant cel-shaded art style, and the trailer’s AI shots ignore that entirely for a false sense of edginess that looks pretty corny when juxtaposed with clips of colorful, cartoonish gameplay. The studio didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>SNK was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/snk-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman-mbs-king-of-fighte-1848754233"><span>purchased by the Saudi Public Investment Fund in 2022</span></a><span>. Despite promises that the ownership change </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snk-saudi-arabias-96-ownership-doesnt-affect-us-in-any-way"><span>would have no impact</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> doesn’t seem to have been exempt from the effects of this. The country’s sovereign wealth fund also owns Al-Nassr FC, and its soccer star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cristiano-ronaldo-fatal-fury-city-wolves-saudi-arabia-1851772758"><span>Cristiano Ronaldo</span></a><span> was later added to <em>CotW</em> as a playable character. It’s a shame because the game itself is decent.&nbsp; It even took home the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>Best Fighting Game award</span></a><span> at this year’s Game Awards.</span></p>

 <p><span>SNK’s problematic ties to Saudi Arabia aren’t going anywhere in the future, but it could avoid making things worse by not piling gen AI junk on top of them. This also doesn’t bode well for Saudi Arabia’s other massive game purchase. It’s currently on track to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726"><span>own Electronic Arts by the end of the summer</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <guid>1407424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> just got a big balance patch, and even if you're not someone who's great at parsing patch notes, you might want to tune into this one, because basically every character that's been widely regarded as terrible for months now got a big buff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.03.2 is simply billed as "Balance Adjustments and Feature Updates" but includes a very, very long list of Nightfarer, Relic, Equipment, Sorcery, Incantations, and other adjustments that should prove a major boon especially to a few Nightfarers that desperately needed some love: Raider, Guardian, Executor, and Revenant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've shared the patch notes below, but here's a quick summary for each of these four characters. Guardian, whose role is generally to "tank" bosses, guard hits, and keep enemy attention so their teammates can wail on them, got a buff to damage negation and to his Guard Boost ability. Raider, a big slow heavy attacker, has historically been a little<em> too </em>slow in attacking to be really viable, so he got a big boost to attack speed. Revenant, historically just weak all around if very fun to play, got a big attack power boost to her summoned spirits. And Executor, a speedy melee attacker who plays a bit like Wolf in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, got buffs to seemingly everything: damage, stamina, damage negation, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community, especially those who like to main those four Nightfarers, are especially thrilled. Several of these guys, especially Raider and Revenant, have been struggling for a while now, and their weaknesses were becoming even more evident next to the two newly-added Nightfarers in the Forsaken Hollows DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those aren't the only changes, just the biggest character-related ones.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Right at the end of 2025, as <strong>Amazon's</strong> second season of its successful <strong>Fallout TV show </strong>adaptation was airing, a report appeared to identify the next TV show adaptation Amazon would be pulling out of the Fallout franchise: <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-reportedly-working-on-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show/">a reality TV show competition based on <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong></a>. Well, that report has been proven true, as Amazon confirmed today that it is developing a reality TV competition show based on Fallout Shelter, where contestants will test their nuclear apocalypse survival skills for a cash prize.</p>



<p>The news was revealed in a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fallout-competition-show-fallout-shelter-amazon-1236632365/">Variety</a>, which confirmed that the series will begin with <strong>10 episodes</strong> and that <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting for the series has officially opened</a>. According to the show's logline, this new reality TV competition show is "<em>Set inside Vault-Tec’s bomb-proof vaults, ‘Fallout Shelter’ drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games’ signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling. Across a series of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral crossroads, contestants must prove their ingenuity, teamwork, and resilience as they compete for safety, power, and ultimately a huge cash prize</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers! In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society.

</div></figure>



<p>The casting page for the show adds that contestants will be tested on challenges all to do with seven core attributes players can upgrade in the games: Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L). </p>



<p>"<em>The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances</em>," the casting page reads. "<em>It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L?</em>"</p>



<p>The report adds that the show will feature "<em>deeply social, psychological, and narrative-driven gameplay</em>," to match the "<em>choice-driven ethos</em>" of the games. Bethesda's <strong>James Altman</strong> and <strong>Todd Howard</strong> are both signed on as executive producers on the show, alongside Stephen Lambert, Tim Harcourt, Jack Burgess, Toni Ireland, Stephen Yemoh, Stephen Lovelock and Amina Badresingh from Studio Lambert.</p>



<p>If you think you have what it takes to survive the nuclear apocalypse in this reality show, then you can send in your <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting form at the link here</a>. If you're looking for something Fallout-related to keep you in the Fallout mindset for the show, then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">beyond checking out the second season </a>of the original TV show adaptation and diving back into<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/"> Fallout 4 with the Anniversary Edition</a>, you can look forward to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">rumoured remasters of <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong></a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sequel to Subway Surfers, Subway Surfer City, releases on February 26, 2026; interested players can pre-register now. </p>



<p>Subway Surfers is undoubtedly not only one of the most popular endless runners out there, but also one of the most-played mobile games. I know I have spent hours on end trying achieve the highest score and beat all my friends. Fans of this game can now look forward to a brand new sequel, which introduces a lot of new stuff. </p>







<h2 id="h-subway-surfers-city-release-date-revealed">Subway Surfers City Release Date Revealed </h2>



<p>Revealed through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/subwaysurfers/status/2011831031184138243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Subway Surfers City arrives next month with new gameplay mechanics, game modes, challenges, and improved visuals. A new press release on <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115285583/en/SYBO-Announces-Subway-Surfers-City-The-Long-Awaited-Next-Chapter-to-Subway-Surfers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Wire</a> by the developer SYBO reveals some of the new mechanics players will be able to try out. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Time to gear up. 🏙️</p><p>Join the crew. Be part of the movement.</p><p>Subway Surfers City expands the journey into Subway City with new gameplay mechanics and modes, handcrafted challenges, and stunning visuals.</p><p>🎮 Pre-register now: <a href="https://t.co/xCJUIT1hcF">https://t.co/xCJUIT1hcF</a><br>📅 Launching Feb 26… <a href="https://t.co/BhCN8XFZg2">pic.twitter.com/BhCN8XFZg2</a></p></div>— Subway Surfers (@subwaysurfers) <a href="https://twitter.com/subwaysurfers/status/2011831031184138243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The game will introduce a “<strong>stomp move</strong>” that can be used to reveal hidden advantages, a “<strong>bouncy bubblegum shield</strong>” that can enhance your jump abilities, and more. </p>



<p>Additionally, there are three new modes to look forward to once Subway Surfers City is released. <strong>Classic Endless</strong>, the endless runner experience where players chase new high scores. The <strong>City Tour</strong>, which is a finite game mode where players will progress through levels, complete goals and explore districts while completing missions and finding hidden stars. Lastly, there is the <strong>Events</strong> mode, which will feature a rotation of finite runs and trials. </p>



<p>The original Subway Surfers game crossed 4.5 billion lifetime downloads in 2025, making it the most downloaded mobile game of all time, so the sequel has some pretty big shoes to fill. </p>



<p>Interested readers can pre-register for Subway Surfers City prior to its release on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sybogames.subway.surfers.game&amp;hl=en_IN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/subway-surfers-city/id6504188939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iOS App Store</a>. </p>

                <p>Another Fallout show is in the works for Prime Video, though it'll be quite different from the popular scripted drama starring Walton Goggins. Amazon is developing a competition series with the working title Fallout Shelter, and the company just put out a casting call online.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">casting call</a>, contestants (or "dwellers") will "live together in a top-secret vault" and compete in games related to "core attributes" from the Fallout universe. Loyalty and alliances between dwellers will also be tested, with an official Fallout X account describing the game as containing "escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums." Casting applications close on February 15.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/falloutonprime/status/2011835665261216027?s=20" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers!

The studio also produced another reality competition tie-in to a dystopian streaming show, working on Squid Game: The Challenge for Netflix.</p><p>It's unknown what kind of tasks Fallout Shelter will put its contestants through, but hopefully it won't be as ethically questionable as MrBeast's competition show and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beast-games-contestants-file-lawsuit-against-mrbeasts-production-company/1100-6526558/" data-ref-id="1100-6526558">lawsuit magnet Beast Games</a>, which also calls Prime Video its streaming home.</p><p>Fallout Shelter shares a title with the 2015 mobile game, which has players build and manage their own vaults.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Steam Hardware Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<p>Games earn the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-verified-program-expanding-to-other-hardware-running-steamos-like-legion-go-s/1100-6531502/" data-ref-id="1100-6531502">Steam Deck Verified label</a> after testing by Valve. Being verified isn't necessarily an indicator that a game will run flawlessly on the handheld device, but rather that it checks off requirements of full controller compatibility, proper display settings, and middleware support.</p><p>From Valve's perspective, any game that meets those requirements on Steam Deck is good to go on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-machine-has-overlap-with-traditional-consoles-but-its-not-one/1100-6536196/" data-ref-id="1100-6536196">more console-like Steam Machine</a>. Valve hasn't offered any more specific details about technical requirements for Steam Machine Verification.</p><p>Games that lack that marketable green checkmark badge might still be playable on Steam Deck; they just might be missing one of the main requirements. Some games like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 were initially Steam Deck Verified by Valve before being recategorized as "Playable" due to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-deck/spider-man-2-rating-demoted" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">graphical and performance issues</a>.</p><p>In the same interview with Game Developer, Yang mentioned that the verification process for the company's Steam Frame VR headset will be different, but Valve will still "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback." Valve has still yet to announce dates and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-price-valve-may-have-just-given-the-best-clue-yet/1100-6536462/" data-ref-id="1100-6536462">prices for the Steam Machine</a> and Steam Frame, other than a vague 2026 release window.</p>

                <p>The ongoing RAM shortages and the associated increase in RAM prices are starting to affect other pieces of hardware that make use of fast memory. Graphics cards are especially susceptible, which has seemingly forced Nvidia to start discontinuing at least two 50-series cards that ship with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>A report by Hardware Unboxed states that several GPU manufactueres have designated both the RTX 5070Ti and the 16GB version of the RTX 5060Ti as "end of life," meaning that no new stock is being produced. At CES 2026, Asus, one of the largest AIB partners Nvidia works with, confirmed stock of the two cards was difficult to acquire from Nvidia and that current stock of both cards would be the last until further notice.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yteN21aJEvE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The report mentions that Asus is not alone in this decision, and that several other manufacturers and retailers (specifically across Australia) have noted the same for existing stock of both SKUs. The RTX 5070, which features 12GB of VRAM, seems unaffected for now, while cheaper cards with 8GB of VRAM, such as the regular RTX 5060, will continue to be produced. That leaves the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 as the only cards part of this generation of Nvidia GPUs that ship with 16GB or more VRAM, with both still only available at inflated prices.</p><p>Hardware Unboxed notes that Nvidia was expected to announce a 50-series refresh at CES 2026, but opted to delay the launch of these newer 50-series Super cards to an unspecified date. It's suggested in the report that if RAM pricing doesn't stabilize in the near future that this launch could be cancelled altogether, leaving few options for those looking to either build or upgrade a gaming PC that is well-equipped for most modern and demanding titles.</p>
