<h2 id="why-return-to-ashes-of-the-singularity-now">Why Return to Ashes of the Singularity Now</h2>



<p><strong>It's been several years since the first Ashes of the Singularity. A year and a half ago, you released a game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ara: History Untold</a>. Why was this the right time to get back to Ashes for you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Adrian, you want to field that one?</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> Yeah. As we were finishing up and looking at our next project, considering where we were at, it just made sense for us to go back and revisit Ashes. Ashes has had a really good following. A lot of folks have joined the Discord community and are really excited about Ashes 2 coming out. For us, you know, we have our own proprietary engine, and games like Ashes just really allow us to push that even further. So Ashes just made a lot of sense when we were figuring out what our next project would be.</p>



<h2 id="evolution-from-benchmark-to-gameplay-first">An Evolution From Benchmark to Gameplay-First</h2>



<p><strong>One of the distinguishing features of Ashes of the Singularity was that, for a time (and perhaps even still to this day), it was one of the most benchmarked games. It was the first game to use DirectX 12, so it was quite important from a technical point of view. Now that it's been 10 years, how do you plan to evolve this legacy? Do you still plan to rely heavily on being a new technical benchmark, or are you perhaps more focused on gameplay this time around?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We're much more focused on the game and gameplay for the second one. Not that we won't push the boundaries, and we certainly have a benchmark that folks can use, but it's really more important to us that the game is really, really solid and fun to play. That's the number one driver for this game, not solely being a benchmark.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss06-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="scale-and-unit-count-thousands-on-screen">Scale and Unit Count: Thousands on Screen</h2>



<p><strong>Even so, how did the tech evolve compared to the first one? Can you do more things now? One of the main features of the first game was its support for thousands of units. Are you still looking to maintain that scale, or even expand it, in Ashes of the Singularity II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Absolutely. From a technology standpoint, the engine has evolved a lot. Ashes of the Singularity 1 was built on what we can kind of think of as Nitrous Engine 1.0. The engine evolved from&nbsp;Ashes of the Singularity 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ara: History Untold, and now to Ashes of the Singularity II. What we're actually working with is an evolved version of the Ara engine. So it's a substantial improvement technologically over both what was in Ashes 1 and even another jump up over what we had available in Ara.</p>



<p>From a rendering standpoint, we're still focusing on large maps and large worlds with vast quantities of units, buildings, characters, and detail. If you've seen the "living world" aspects of Ara, we've brought a lot of that technology forward into Ashes of the Singularity<em> </em>II to make the maps a lot more interesting, livable, and believable, while still maintaining the scope and scale from Ashes 1 where you can just have a vast number of units on screen.</p>



<p>The focus of Ashes of the Singularity II from the get-go has been to be a real-time strategy game of scale, and we needed the technology to be able to power that. We didn't want to just have fights between 10 units per player. We wanted an order of magnitude greater than that. We wanted 100 units versus 100 units. And then we wanted to have battles with multiple players all throwing units at each other across vast, sprawling maps. So you could do an eight-player game where each player is managing well over a hundred individual units at the same time, if not 200 to 300. You wind up with multiple thousands of units at any given time on some of the larger battles.</p>



<p>We set out from the ground up to say this is the goal. We don't want an engine like a first-person shooter engine, which deals with a small number of high-fidelity characters. We need the ability to do high-quality characters that we can render in the tens, hundreds, and thousands all on screen at the same time, running very well on both modern PCs and reasonably older PCs. I don't know if a machine that came out as far back as Ashes 1 will run Ashes 2 as well, but we will be able to support hardware as low-end as the Steam Deck, for example. The Steam Deck is sort of our min-spec hardware target, and we're expecting the game to play well on it. We have a high degree of customization on our graphics options, everything from resolution to various features, so we support a wide degree of scalability. We wanted to ensure our high-end settings, the things that we would use for a benchmark, are also pushed pretty high. If you want to run the game at 4K with a lot of graphics settings, you will push almost any modern hardware. But if you want to run it on a low-power GPU device like the Steam Deck, you absolutely can.</p>



<h2 id="system-requirements-and-hardware-scalability">System Requirements and Hardware Scalability</h2>



<p><strong>I saw that you've already listed the system requirements on Steam. Are those accurate, or are they still subject to revision?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Expect some small revisions there. We're in the midst right now of doing a lot of broad-scale hardware compatibility and performance testing. We expect a lot of optimizations over the next several months, and a lot of the data we get from Steam Next Fest will help us better optimize and understand people's hardware configurations. It varies a lot on PC, and we want to understand what we need to do and how to best target graphic settings for it.</p>



<p>So, it's a reasonable spot for what we have listed as the Steam hardware recommendations. I won't say those are final, though, because we hope to get them even lower realistically depending on how performance optimizations go. We'd love to push it lower, but we always want to list a safe cut-off so that we're not encouraging people with very old PCs to jump in and struggle to play it.</p>

<h2 id="dx12-features-no-ray-tracing-hdr-modern-graphics-tech">DX12 Features (But No Ray Tracing or HDR) &amp; Modern Graphics Tech</h2>



<p><strong>Does Ashes of the Singularity II<em> </em>support ray tracing? If not, do you think it would even make sense in a real-time strategy game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> We had some promising ray tracing experiments, but at the scale of our game, it was simply too slow for the visual payoff. Ray tracing becomes significantly more expensive when everything in your scene is in motion or can be deformed. With the number of objects that can be on-screen, it can consume an enormous amount of GPU memory as well. The most appealing benefit for an RTS would be the ability to properly shadow the many thousands of point, line, and area lights.</p>



<p><strong>Will the game support HDR displays? If not, can you explain why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> No, we don’t have official support. Unfortunately, only a small portion of our players have HDR displays. Moreover, an RTS game requires quite a bit of tuning to both look excellent and play well.</p>



<ol></ol>



<div><p><strong>Are you using any of the latest DX12 features, such as Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM), Work Graphs, and Tiled Resource Tier 4? Which one do you think will be more impactful in the coming years?</strong></p><p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> We aren’t using these specific features, but we are using many of the newer shader model features, such as the new wave intrinsics. Though these are a little bit older features at this point, we also make heavy use of enhanced 16-bit float support and bindless textures to improve performance.</p></div>



<p>As for Work Graphs, we are not using them because we have implemented our own subset internally. After consultation with IHVs, it was unclear if the native support would be significantly faster than our current implementation. Additionally, we would still need our current implementation for older hardware anyway (e.g., GTX 970 or RX 580). However, we’ve given the IHVs access to our code so they can experiment with it for future architectures.</p>



<p>In terms of the most impactful, it’s hard to say. Unfortunately, Tiled Resource Tier 4 is difficult to use properly on a PC architecture, so we don’t think that it will have a huge impact. Work Graphs definitely have the potential to be most impactful, but will likely need a generation or two of hardware advancements to really see the benefit.</p>



<ol start="2"></ol>



<h2 id="console-and-steam-deck-potential">Steam Deck and Console Potential</h2>



<p><strong>Just one last question on the technical side. Are you open to potential console releases for Ashes of the Singularity II, or is it just a PC game in your mind?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> I mean, we would love it to be everywhere. The core goal for us is to make sure that the gameplay works for everybody. Brad mentioned the Steam Deck. If you're a PC player who's played RTS games, you'll have all the plethora of keybinds and shortcuts that you're used to, but it's also playable with a controller on the Steam Deck as well.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong> Yeah. Coming from the experience lens, from the very beginning of the creation of this sequel, we wanted to be able to validate that the game could be played both on a controller/gamepad as well as keyboard and mouse. That's something we've done to future-proof it in case that comes to pass and we do move to console. But for now, the proof of that is evident in our work on the Steam Deck. We do test on controllers, so that's something we've kept in mind to keep ourselves open to that possibility.</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> And I think the biggest thing there is to ensure we do not lose functionality just because we want to be on a different platform. The core PC experience is the core SKU. As we look at making the user experience work for the Steam Deck or other platforms, we don't want to lose functionality. We want it to be playable and be a really good RTS game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss07-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="ai-improvements-and-difficulty-scaling">AI Improvements and Difficulty Scaling</h2>



<p><strong>Okay. Can you speak about the improvements made to the AI compared to the first game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Certainly. In terms of how we use it, we use player-replacement AI. If you want to play a single-player game, we have multiple modes. There's a campaign mode, which is a narrative, story-driven mode. And then we have a sandbox-style skirmish mode where you can currently play against up to seven different AIs. You can do friendly teams, asymmetric matches, free-for-all, whatever you would like to set up.</p>



<p>We spent a lot of time getting the AI functional pretty early and ensuring that it was a reasonable competitive challenge for a typical player, trying to scale it up and down for both hardened RTS veterans and players who are very unfamiliar with RTS games. If you've never played an RTS before, we have very easy modes that will help you ramp up and give you a lot of breathing room to explore and feel out the game, and then you can graduate through the different difficulties.</p>



<p>In general, we think they're pretty competitive. We've run tests where the AI is playing with no cheats enabled (it has no insider knowledge about the map), and it plays the game fairly. Right now, it's quite competent at beating a lot of the office staff here at Oxide. A lot of the staff struggle against the default regular AI. If you're a hardened RTS veteran, you can probably take it out thanks to memory knowledge and understanding how to play RTS games well. We also have difficulties that go beyond that, which try to make the AI smarter, and then ones that just outright let it have economic advantages if you want to set yourself up for a very unfair, hard challenge.</p>



<p>We're actually reasonably proud of it. We started with it early, we've been iterating on it over the last several months, and it's playing very well. A number of the core gameplay changes in Ashes of the Singularity II actually facilitate making the AI play better. It's not done, and we know there are more improvements to make, but we think players will be very challenged by just the default AI going into Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h2 id="the-three-factions-uef-phc-and-substrate">The Three Factions: UEF, PHC, and Substrate</h2>



<p><strong>One of the sequel's main changes is the addition of the human faction, the UEF (United Earth Forces). Was it an issue at first when you introduced the idea of AI controlling humans because they play differently?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> That's a great question. We actually started off with the human faction since it was brand new. So really, as we were building out the AI early on, it was being built to handle them. It hasn't been a huge issue. You'll see some different types of units for the PHC in the Next Fest build, where they have a lot of bipedal mechs, for instance, and some other more grounded units alongside an old favorite hover unit from the original game.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Yeah, we set out to build Ashes of the Singularity II; we weren't trying to make Ashes 1.5. It's a pretty ground-level change-up. We knew that the AI was going to have to be rebuilt. It's not the same AI that was present in Ashes 1. As we were exploring what we thought would be the units and the buildings for all the factions (the UEF, the PHC, and the Substrate), we tried to approach everything holistically. We needed an AI that could play all three factions, and we needed gameplay systems that worked for their unique unit rosters. We built them somewhat sequentially: we built the UEF, then we built the PHC, and the Substrate will be available for the full launch after Steam Next Fest, but the entire game was structured so that the AI and systems could support all of them.</p>



<p><strong>What are the main differences between these three factions from a gameplay perspective?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We can talk about the two factions that will be in the Steam Next Fest demo. We kind of want to hold back on revealing too much about the third faction for now. Brett, I'll let you go into more detail on the first two.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Sure. The two factions available for Steam Next Fest are the UEF and the PHC (Post-Human Coalition). The UEF is the new faction for Ashes of the Singularity II. They are a faction of united humans from Earth working against the posthumans and the AI Substrate. Their forces are comprised largely of near-future semi-conventional military units. They have access to infantry, near-future modern armor, tank destroyers, artillery units, etc. They also have access to a few "prototype" units, which are more scientifically advanced. </p>



<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, they start to adopt and steal technologies from the more advanced PHC and Substrate and incorporate them into their arsenals. The UEF is organized around standard tech and generally favors quantity over quality. They use a lot of infantry in the early game to seize territory, and their equipment is not the best, but they pump out a lot of it and can overwhelm enemies with numbers.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong><span> What I might add there is that you've probably noticed in the promotional material that the human faction does, in fact, have humans on the ground.</span> There are infantry units comprised of human beings, which is unique to the UEF faction.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Yeah, and that's a noticeable difference from Ashes 1, which featured the PHC and Substrate, both with a lot of hovercrafts and flying units. There wasn't a whole lot of bipedal units. The UEF units are generally conventional wheeled or tracked vehicles. We have far more ground locomotion-based units here in Ashes<em> </em>of the Singularity II, and we've done great things to make that look cool, like having tanks drive through trees and knock them over.</p>



<p>Conversely, the PHC is sort of like the "tech bro" faction. They consist of a very small number of posthumans, and each one is very powerful. They control an army of drones that we call constructs. Their units skew towards being far more expensive and fewer in number. The PHC takes pride in their creations and wants everything to be the best, the shiniest, and the strongest. Their units are tougher and have more powerful weaponry than their UEF analogues. </p>



<p>They don't field infantry; their cheapest unit is really more of a light tank called the Brute, produced in far fewer numbers than the UEF infantry. They don't have the swarm tactics of the UEF, making some of their units vulnerable to being swarmed, but they have returning units that are adept at countering infantry. The PHC will also feature fan favorites like the Hyperion, which is now a true flying dreadnought—quite powerful, scary, and very challenging to take down.</p>



<p>Narratively, it's been 10 years in real life since the last game came out, and a little bit of time has passed in the in-world timeline as well. If you remember the end of Ashes 1: Escalation, there is mistrust now between Haalee (the Substrate) and the PHC. It makes narrative sense that you would see the posthumans adapt and update their technology because it used to be heavily influenced by Haalee, who is now seen as an enemy by some of them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss05-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="apm-army-system-and-accessibility">APM, Army System, and Accessibility</h2>



<p><strong>Where do you think the game sits on the APM (Actions Per Minute) spectrum compared to the first one? Is it faster-paced, slower-paced, or about the same?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Ashes 1 was a pretty high APM game given the scale, the number of units, workers, and buildings you had to manage. It followed the legacy of games like <em>Total Annihilation</em> through <em>Supreme Commander</em>. It was a high APM game, perhaps not quite as high as <em>StarCraft 2</em> at a competitive level, but still high.</p>



<p>With Ashes of the Singularity<em> </em>II, we are putting in a lot of affordances and control updates that allow you to play the game with a lower APM floor. The ceiling is still fairly high if you want to be tactical, but the army system has been completely reimagined. It's an entirely new system that is core to how you build and recruit units. The goal was to make it so that you can experience these awesome huge battles with a thousand units on screen without needing a very high APM. </p>



<p>You don't have to constantly recruit, lasso five new units, put them in a control group, and move them around. The army system and the warfront system softly automate a lot of those functions. It handles reinforcement automatically. We've put out some developer journals illustrating these changes. It makes it so anyone, even players with low APM or low RTS experience, can enjoy the game. It also makes it very playable on a gamepad. If you want to go APM wild and get into detailed tactical micromanagement, you still can, but the "APM tax" required to play large-scale games previously has been solved.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong> I would just underline the importance of player empowerment. If you are someone who loves micro, our system is set up so you can have dozens of armies with only a few units within them, which replicates the feel of Ashes 1. But the new army system also allows you to group a lot of units into one central control group in a way that can be replenished automatically if you choose.</p>



<h2 id="gamepad-vs-keyboard-and-mouse">Gamepad vs Keyboard and Mouse</h2>



<p><strong>Since you're running internal tests, do you think an experienced player on a gamepad can beat a less experienced player on keyboard and mouse, or will they still be destroyed?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Absolutely. An experienced gamepad player would be able to beat a newer, less experienced person playing on keyboard and mouse. There's a bigger demand for strategic thinking in <em>Ashes 2</em> than in a lot of other games. It's about managing warfronts, positioning, and timing. Those core strategic decisions are reasonably efficient to do with both a gamepad and a keyboard/mouse. There is definitely still an advantage at the tactical, micromanagement level that favors keyboard and mouse because you can get higher APMs, but that's not where we sink much of our gameplay. We're not a game about stutter-stepping 10 units back and forth every quarter of a second to eke out extra DPS. Strategic decisions decide a game of <em>Ashes 2</em>. Between two equally highly skilled players, I would give the edge to the keyboard and mouse player due to flexibility, but at the strategic level, a good strategic player on a gamepad will beat a weak strategic player on a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p><strong>Good to know, because nowadays I prefer playing on a gamepad; it's a lot more accessible.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We've been playing on Steam Deck for months now to ensure it's very playable. All the core strategic functions are highly accessible on a gamepad.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss02-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="modding-support">Modding Support</h2>



<p><strong>Modding was quite important for the first game. How did you approach it for the second one? Are you going to support Steam Workshop eventually?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> We haven't announced any formal plans for what we will support with modding at launch, but the engine, especially where we're at with Nitrous, is very moddable. We have a lot of things that are highly exposed and easily accessible on the data end, and we use a combination of Lua and XML for a lot of our interface elements. There's definitely more than basic ability to do great mods for it. We also have a cool scenario editor. How much in-engine support we will have natively out of the box is still TBD, but it's an extension of the Nitrous 1 engine, so it's just as moddable as Ashes 1 was, if not better. It's very easy for people to mod stuff through Lua, XML, and data setups. We've even had internal alpha testers already modify data locally just to try different configurations and setups out.</p>



<p><strong>Okay. Well, thank you very much for the answers.</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully, this presentation will give us release dates for games like Edge of Memories and The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu that are currently slated to arrive sometime in 2026, but don't have a specific date yet. The trailer also indicates that we'll get another update on <strong>Greedfall 2</strong>, which is currently set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-release-date-march-2026/">leave early access on <strong>March 10, 2026</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Outside of that, we may also get our first update on Nacon's plans for its future <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/"><strong>WRC</strong> titles</a>, and potentially another look at the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-delayed-2026-no-longer-includes-co-op-no-more-early-access-release/">Terminator: Survivors</a></strong> game, which was recently delayed into 2026 and confirmed to no longer be a co-op-focused game but a <strong>single-player</strong> title.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait too long to see what Nacon has in store for 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On February 19, developer Mega Crit finally announced that</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-steam-trailer-2000671424"><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> has a release date</span></a><span>: March 5. For those of us who would gladly sell a kidney to get our hands on the sequel to the best roguelike deckbuilder ever made (sorry, </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span>), this is incredible news. For every indie dev who was inspired to make a roguelike deckbuilder of their own following the original game’s success, however, this is potentially awful news, as </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> early access release date is smack dab in the middle of one of the busiest release periods of the year. <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">It’s <em>Silksong</em> all over again</a>, and games that were set to release around that time are now moving out of the way.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The most well-publicized delay so far is </span><i><span>Handmancers</span></i><span>, a roguelike deckbuilder from developer and publisher 58BLADES. As the devs revealed in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/Handmancers/status/2025236242204336358"><span>X</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Handmancers </span></i><span>was supposed to release during the Turn-Based Thursday Fest, a seven-day-long yearly event that’s scheduled to begin </span><a href="https://turnbasedfest.com/"><span>on March 6</span></a><span>. Considering that it starts a day after </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> March 5 release date, this one feels like a smart call. “Yea…we’d get absolutely crushed,” the team wrote.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The developers behind </span><i><span>Mini Tank Mayhem</span></i><span>, a tower defense and deck-building strategy game from Algorocks, have yet to confirm exactly why their game has suddenly been delayed. However, an apparent tester </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1rbg1ps/comment/o6qrfg7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>on Reddit claimed</span></a><span>&nbsp;that </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> is indeed to blame. While a random comment on Reddit is obviously not the most reliable source, the timing of </span><i><span>Mini Tank Mayhem’s</span></i><span> sudden delay is awfully suspicious. Its </span><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2096260/history/?changeid=U:73009738"><span>SteamDB history confirms</span></a><span> that its 3 March, 2026 release date was pushed back to April 30 (and then changed again to April 29) mere hours after </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> latest trailer dropped.</span></p> <p><i><span>Omelet You Cook</span></i><span>, a “cozy chaotic cooking roguelike” published by SchuBox Games, was ahead of the curve. The two-man dev team responsible for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-meets-luck-be-a-landlord-in-chaotic-cooking-roguelike-that-cant-stop-winning-new-fans-2000668754">excellent <em>Balatro-</em>like food prep game</a> </span><span>decided to move up its 1.0 launch back in January. As confirmed by co-developer Dan Schumacher during an interview with </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, they pulled it forward out of fear that they’d be overshadowed by </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> yet-to-be confirmed (at the time) March release window. “Every streamer we’d reach out to will be playing it. Every roguelike enjoyer will be checking it out. Even I’ll be playing so much that I won’t have time to finish our game!”</span></p>

 <p><span>While no other devs have yet publicly announced any </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span>-related delays, it’s clearly become a popular topic of discussion among indie studios. Bermrad, the studio behind the hack-and-slash roguelite </span><i><span>Trials of Valor</span></i><span>, noted that their game sharing “some elements with </span><i><span>Slay the Spire</span></i><span>” was less of an issue than the release date itself. Unfortunately, the two games </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r9e5vd/were_releasing_the_same_day_as_slay_the_spire_2/"><span>now share</span></a><span> the same release date, as Bermrad announced roughly three weeks ago that </span><i><span>Trials of Valor </span></i><span>will be dropping on March 5.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Other studios have instead chosen to have a little fun with the increased attention on early March’s release lineup. </span><i><span>Grimslair</span></i><span>’s </span><span>developer, ThunderRam Studios, revealed on </span><a href="https://x.com/AWMassMedia/status/2025638786454233168?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span> that there will be “no hiding in the bushes until the hype train passes,” as the studio intends to stick to its previously announced March 6 release date. Fishagon, who are working on the party card game </span><i><span>Vice Versa</span></i><span>, opted to copy and paste 58BLADES’ announcement and swap it out </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1rbnq5n/handmancers_release_date_announcement_forces_vice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>with references to their game</span></a><span> instead. </span></p> <p>Games have tried ride the hype wave for a top Steam release before. <span>It’s essentially what the developers behind the decent Metroidvania <i>Adventure of</i><em> Samsara</em> did last year, launching on the same day as<em> Silksong</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-atari-adventure-of-samsara-2000624067">It did not go well</a>. Other studios, fortunately, have been spared from making that choice themselves. </span><i>Slumber Realm</i>’s devs, Chugga Chugga LLC, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1rb638e/another_slay_the_spire_2_related_announcement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">announced</a> that their card game roguelike won’t be ready in time to compete with <i>Slay the Spire 2</i> anyway, or, as they put it, “I guess in every sense it has no impact.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-explains-why-clouds-hair-looks-rough-on-switch-2-2000672823</link>
            <guid>1444075</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, Square Enix released <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a></em> on Nintendo Switch 2. The port of the 2020 RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851">well-received</a>, with many praising the game’s clarity and performance. But there was one aspect of <em>FF7 Remake</em> that annoyed some players: Cloud’s famous luxurious hair could look fuzzy or pixelated at times. Well, in a new interview, the game’s director has explained <em>thoroughly</em> why this is the case, and said that it might be a problem in future<em> FF7</em> remake trilogy ports on Switch 2 as well.</p>  <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7-20260223-423487/">In an interview posted on February 23, <em>Automaton</em></a> talked to <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em>&nbsp;director Naoki Hamaguchi about the Switch 2 port of the RPG. Specifically, they asked him about Cloud’s pixelated hair. Instead of just saying, “Hey, guys, the Switch 2 isn’t as beefy as a high-end PC or PS5, so we had to make some compromises,” the director behind the remake provided a very detailed response. Here’s some of it via Google Translate:</p>

 <blockquote><p><span dir="auto">“In <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, we use a process called TAA (Temporal Anti-Aliasing) to prevent the outlines of characters from appearing jagged. TAA is a system that creates smoother images that are closer to high resolution by referencing and overlaying information from past frames in addition to the currently drawn frame. </span><span dir="auto">Hair is a very thin component, so if you draw it as is, it’s easy for each dot to appear or disappear. That’s why in this game, we use a special process that switches between drawing and not drawing hair on a dot-by-dot basis for each frame. By combining this process with TAA, we make it so that the fine hair lines appear to connect smoothly across frames.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Got all that? Hamaguchi then explained that when the Switch 2 is in portable mode, there are “<span dir="auto">additional restrictions.” This forces the game to lower its internal resolution to ensure solid performance. But doing this makes it harder for TAA to create a stable image, leading to the “graininess and jaggedness” of Cloud’s hair. But because <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-adore-final-fantasy-7-remakes-dorky-eco-terrorists-1842843860">FF7 Remake</a></em> on Switch 2 uses a dynamic resolution system, his hair can look worse or better depending on the scene.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Cloud’s fuzzy, pixelated hair is likely to return in <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2</em></h2> <p>So hopefully, that explains why Cloud’s hair is a bit pixelated in the Switch 2 port. As for the upcoming Switch 2 port of 2024’s <em>Rebirth</em>, which is set to arrive in June, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4-ue5-gen-ai-2000663075">the third and final entry in the project releasing sometime in the future</a>, Hamaguchi made it clear that you’ll probably see some fuzzy Cloud hair in those releases, too.</p>

 <p><span dir="auto">“Yes, on the Nintendo Switch 2, in order to stabilize the frame rate, the internal resolution is lowered in scenes with a high load, and DLSS compensates for that,” the director told the outlet. “This is a basic mechanism that is not compatible with current hair rendering technology.”</span></p>

 <p>But Hamaguchi says that being able to play <em>FF7 Remake</em> on the go is worth the trade-off of some elements, like Cloud’s hair, being a bit fuzzy, adding, <span dir="auto">“There are limitations unique to portable devices, but we will continue to do our best to continue optimizing it so that we can improve it even if only a little.”</span></p> <p>I genuinely love that the director didn’t offer up some boring PR quote about the hair, but dug into how it works and why it looks that way. Making games is, like playing games, a series of decisions and trade-offs. Considering how great<em> FF7 Remake</em> runs and plays on Switch 2, I think some fuzzy hair is a fine compromise, even if Cloud might disagree.</p>

The retailer is currently offering an excellent deal on the fantastic PS5-exclusive game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, dropping it down to just $32.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxp2m?object_uuid=64b9e711-fa3f-4f2a-b838-fd953f4f9d68&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D5SM3K4Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it here</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is 45% off its full list price of $59.99, but more importantly, it appears to be the lowest price it's hit at Amazon so far, according to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D5SM3K4Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>.

Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">review</a> from IGN's Simon Cardy called it, "A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities" and said "it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive." He even added that, "Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The praise certainly didn't end there, though. Astro Bot also won <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-game-awards-2024">Game of the Year at The Game Awards back in 2024</a>, and took home our top prize as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-playstation-game-of-2024">best PlayStation game of 2024</a>. In regard to the latter, IGN's Matt Purslow said, "Astro Bot is a Mario-matching 3D platformer that excels on all fronts: tremendous stage design, intuitive movement, fun power-ups, and a smart approach to combining all of those elements in exciting new ways on each world visited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned before, this isn't the only game deal to explore right now.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/australian-magpie-swooping-video-game/</link>
            <guid>1444045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Fun fact: for all the stereotypes Americans have about the dangers of Australian wildlife, few of the most stereotypical creatures present any kind of threat to the average person living their average life here. Sharks, snakes, emus–most of us don't see those killers on a daily basis, because we live in cities and they (mostly) don't. For urban-dwelling Australians, the biggest danger to our health and happiness is instead the most unlikely nemesis: the magpie.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6uRhXQGj2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Australian Magpies Singing Compilation - one of the most beautiful bird calls"></iframe></figure><p>A bird that for most of the year gets by looking cool and eating leftover chips, and which has a unique, beautiful call (above), the Australian magpie is much bigger than most other magpies you might be familiar with, depending where you are in the world (another fun fact: Australian magpies aren't Corvids like most others, they're Artamidae). But it's not their stature that makes them a danger. No, it's their <em>swoop</em>.</p><p>Magpies have been living alongside humans in Australia for tens of thousands of years, from indigenous inhabitants to the first European settlements of the 18th century and beyond, and for 8-9 months every year we get along just fine. I say that because, for the other months, a small percentage of the birds become highly aggressive during breeding season, and will spend the springtime months trying to injure, or even peck the eyes out of, every human that walks, runs or rides their bike past a tree that has a magpie nest in it.</p><p>Here's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpie?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>an example of what I'm talking about</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly "snap" their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and pecking at the face and eyes.</blockquote><p>For decades Australians have tried all kinds of things to deter these strikes, or at least mitigate the damage. As kids, I remember we were told to try drawing eyes (or sticking giant googly eyes) on the back of our bike helmets, because there was a theory that a magpie wouldn't swoop you if it thought you were watching it.</p><p>It doesn't work:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGGTcYfrEZU?start=68&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Amber and Billo's - Amber vs the Magpie - The Eyes Don't Work"></iframe></figure><p>What about travelling at speed past a magpie's nest, hoping you can simply outrun it?</p><p>Doesn't work:</p><figure><iframe width="113" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmnbiCTYSOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Magpie attacks kid on scooter"></iframe></figure><p>These are funny videos, and let me tell you, seeing this shit happen in real life is just as funny, and because this is happening to <em>them </em>and not to you, you can laugh.</p><p>But when it's happening to you? Jesus Christ. These things are a <em>terror</em>. The whooshing sound of their approach and the clacking of their beak or claws, coming out of <em>nowhere </em>(they only ever swoop from behind) is like a shark attack on land, and as someone who lives near a <em>lot </em>of magpies, I can attest to how eager they are to claw and bite at any exposed skin they can get their beaks on. Example: last year I was swooped while riding to the post office and the bird bit me so hard and fast that it split the top of my ear open; it hurt like hell, but the biggest danger was that when you're riding a bike you don't see or hear these things coming and then CLACK, suddenly there's a part of your ear missing, and you get so startled that you come very close to crashing your bike and doing much more serious damage.</p><p>The only thing I've found that helps is to cover your helmet with zip ties, like this. It doesn't stop magpies from swooping you (how would they know what a zip tie was, they still don't know what bikes are), but it will at least afford a little protection by keeping them at wingtip's distance, and make sure they only swoop you once, and not repeatedly:</p><figure></figure><figure><iframe width="113" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9VWuIMCNNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="When Magpies Attack Your Face"></iframe></figure><p>All that,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVEYcTyj1Do&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>donning my armour like Theoden at Helm's Deep</u></a>, just so I can ride to the shops to buy some milk! Gah, I hate these fuckin birds! And yet for all my past, despite all my hatred for magpies--or, perhaps, <em>because</em> of it–this month I have been learning to live as one of them, to try to understand their ways and what drives them.</p><p>All of which is a very long-winded way of saying I've been playing <em>Pie In The Sky</em>, and it's been great.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gba2Byj2iHo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Pie in the Sky | Launch Trailer | indie.io"></iframe></figure><p>A game where you <em>control </em>a murderous magpie, instead of being its victim, <em>Pie in the Sky</em> has<a href="https://youtu.be/CTc7SHSz2H0?t=674&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the energy of a weird PS2 game</u></a> and the structure of an early <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em>, dropping you into various, deeply Australian scenarios and asking you to collect letters, prank workers and, most importantly, swoop people.</p><p><em>Pie in the Sky</em> is a largely frustrating thing to play, in that the magpie's controls (especially its swooping boost) are, much like the bird, fast and untamed, and the lo-fi look gets so lo-fi in points that it can be tough to distinguish features in a level or, more importantly, notice good jokes. For a game built on precision controls and stringing moves together to build combos (ala <em>THPS</em>), it can be pretty annoying.</p><p>But it's still a pleasure to be around. The interaction with these levels is just the excuse to indulge in some Australiana,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia/"> <u>an invitation I'm more than happy to indulge in</u></a>. I particularly loved the opening level, a homage to Australia's particular brand of suburban dystopia, though the coffee-obsessed Melbourne stage was also a highlight.</p><p>I will never forgive these birds IRL. But for a few weeks I have, at least, been able to appreciate where they're coming from. If I could have that much flying through the sky, knocking bins over and terrorising AFL fans, I'd probably be an asshole of a bird as well.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Seeing 'CARKED IT' (aka, 'YOU DIED') in a video game felt bizarrely patriotic </span></p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>A gaming education</h2>
<p>Unlike Spencer, who spent years at Microsoft Game Studios before heading Microsoft’s gaming division, Sharma has no professional experience in the video game industry. And her personal experience with Xbox also seems somewhat limited; after sharing her Gamertag on social media over the weekend, curious gamers found that <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/newly-named-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-has-shared-her-gamertag-so-what-is-she-playing-and-why-does-it-matter">her Xbox play history dates back roughly one month</a>. That’s also in stark contrast to Spencer, who has <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/user/p3">amassed a score of over 121,000</a> across decades of play.</p>
<p>In her interview with Variety, Sharma cited <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/firewatch-review-getting-lost-in-the-remote-wilderness-and-loving-it/">2016’s <em>Firewatch</em></a> as an example of the kinds of games with “deep emotional resonance” and “a distinct point of view” that she’s looking for from Microsoft. And on social media, Sharma <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025259405948895268">shared her list</a> of the three greatest games ever: “<em>Halo</em>, <em>Valheim</em>,<em> Goldeneye</em>,” for what it’s worth. Sharma also seems to be taking recommendations for games to catch up on; after <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025266343143243917">saying on social media</a> that she would try <em>Borderlands 2</em>, the game <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/user/AMRAHSAHSA">appeared in her recently played games</a> over the weekend.</p>

<p>Being a personal fan of video games isn’t necessarily required to succeed in running a gaming company. Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/09/feature_hiroshi_yamauchi_the_man_who_made_nintendo">famously didn’t care for video games</a> even as he launched the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System to worldwide success in the 1980s. Still, the lack of direct experience with the gaming world marks a sharp change after Spencer’s long tenure at a time when Microsoft is struggling to redefine the Xbox brand amid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">cratering hardware sales</a>, a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">pivot away from software exclusives</a>, and a move to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">extend the Xbox brand to many different devices</a>.</p>
<p>Xbox President and COO Sarah Bond, who by all accounts was being set up to succeed Spencer, also announced her departure from Microsoft on Friday, ending a nearly nine-year stint as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">a public face</a> for the company’s gaming efforts. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">The Verge reports</a> that Bond caused a lot of friction within the Xbox team when she championed the “Xbox Everywhere” strategy and “This is an Xbox” marketing campaign, which focused on streaming Xbox games to hardware like mobile phones and tablets, according to anonymous sources. Shortly before the launch of that campaign in 2024, Microsoft lost marketing executives <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-restructures-marketing-team-as-chief-jerret-west-departs-for-roblox">Jerrett West</a> and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-cvp-kareem-choudhry-is-leaving-microsoft-amid-a-large-xbox-leadership-shake-up">Kareem Choudry</a>, leading to significant internal reorganization.</p>
<p>Longtime Xbox Game Studios executive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/microsoft-shuts-down-bethesdas-hi-fi-rush-redfall-studios/">Matt Booty</a>, whose history in the game industry dates back to working for Williams Electronics in the ’90s, has been promoted to executive vice president and chief content officer for Xbox and “will continue working closely with [Sharma] to ensure a smooth transition,” Microsoft said in its announcement Friday.</p>

			<p>With <strong>Ubisoft's</strong> massive organizational shake-up and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong><em>"major reset</em></strong>"</a> officially revealed last month, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">a lot of changes at the company</a>. Even before it was properly revealed, though, big changes had been made, with the establishment of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a></strong> and the departure of the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">Marc-Alexis Côté</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, we learned who would be replacing Côté, with three veteran Assassin's Creed developers <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM">at the helm of the franchise</a> for the foreseeable future. The first is the new head of the brand, <strong>Martin Schelling,</strong> who has been with Ubisoft since 2003. He has worked on the AC series since <strong>AC: Revelations,</strong> where he was a producer. He was also a producer on <strong>AC IV: Black Flag</strong>, and then a senior producer on <strong>AC: Origins</strong> and <strong>AC: Valhalla</strong>. He moved further up the ladder since then and was most recently the chief production officer under the old organizational structure.</p>



<p>Second, is <strong>Jean Guesdon</strong>, who has been named the head of content for the Assassin's Creed brand. Fans of the series may recognize Guesdon as the creative director behind both AC IV: Black Flag and AC: Origins. After 17 years with Ubisoft, he left the company in 2018 to become an advisor at Classcraft and then moved to <strong>Behavior Interactive</strong> to be the studio's senior creative director. That only lasted a year, and in 2024, he came back to Ubisoft to take on the director of strategic visualization role, before now becoming the head of content for the entire AC brand.</p>



<p>Last but not least is <strong>François de Billy</strong>, who will become the head of production excellence in this new structure. He has remained with Ubisoft since 2001, where he initially worked on the first <strong>Splinter Cell</strong> game on the original Xbox. He's also been with the AC series since its beginnings, working as a production manager on the first AC game, associate producer on <strong>AC II</strong>, and as production manager on AC IV: Black Flag, AC: Origins, and AC: Valhalla. His most recent role has been the global senior production director, which he has held since 2021.</p>

<p>"<em>It is wonderful to be back after all these years. Assassin’s Creed has been a defining part of my professional life and being back feels like coming home. This universe, these characters, these worlds, and of course the community have always meant so much to me</em>," said Guesdon in a post shared to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1rclibk/an_update_on_the_future_of_assassins_creed_meet/">Assassin's Creed Reddit page</a> from Ubisoft's official account.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m&nbsp;especially grateful to be sharing this journey with all of you&nbsp;again, and&nbsp;look forward to sharing more about the next steps ahead for the franchise.</em> <em>Until then...Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted</em>"</p>



<p>For all of Ubisoft's recent woes, the Assassin's Creed brand remains its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">biggest driver of revenue</a> during its current troubles. Placing the franchise in the hands of three people who clearly have a lot of familiarity with it, including one person who was a key member in creating one of the most beloved entries in the series, should point to a brighter future for both Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed. That's the hope, at least.</p>

Helix: Descent N Ascent sounds like it should be a mascot platformer starring a jaunty DNA molecule with floating Rayman hands, whose special power is making stuff go up and down. Up and down the evolutionary ladder, even! A platform game in which you can evolve and devolve your character at will, to solve different puzzles? Good lord, we’ll make one million dollars out of this! Somebody get me the CEO of Midway. 
</p>
<p>
Alas for my career prospects, Midway is no more. And Helix is not a mascot platformer, probably to its benefit. As revealed by the new Steam demo, it’s a slow and atmospheric puzzler in which you investigate a fallen civilisation, while chasing your doppelganger. You being a lanky Area-51-looking lad, who acquires paranormal powers and must weave them into solutions for terrain puzzles of the Pressure Plate N Lever variety.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It all takes place in a monochrome world of scraped and sinuous thorns, pipes and spiral shells, whose touchstones span “1980s black-and-white indie comics, 1990s manga, and 1970s Franco-Belgian comics”. Do not strain your entorhinal cortex attempting to visualise these entangled references. Check out the trailer instead.

<p>
This is certainly far too swankypoo for Midway - immortal creators of Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures, to say nothing of Jackie Chan Stuntmaster - but some of your powers do probably qualify as telekinesis, which means that Helix can be mentioned in the same breath as Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy without starting a pub brawl (I patronise a very specific kind of pub). The first power you get lets you conjure blocks and shove them around. Then you get the ability to fly a little explodable drone that resembles your head. There are games within the game, including an eerie little tribute to Donkey Kong.
</p><p>
The screenshots may suggest artists doodling at random, but those single screen rooms join up into a larger maze that has definite mystique, reminding me of Amanita’s creations here and there. The puzzles aren’t that brain-fizzing so far, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736370/Helix_Descent_N_Ascent/">the Steam page</a> suggests that things will escalate. “Play in 25 distinctive ways, jumping between 3 levels of complexity while you explore the barren lands of Helix.” The full game is out later this year.

            <p>A trio of long-time Assassin's Creed developers will lead the series into its "next era" now that it's under the umbrella of Vantage Studios, Ubisoft's new sub-company partly funded by Tencent. Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy are being handed the reins.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM/new-leadership-team-set-to-shape-the-next-era-of-assassins-creed">blog post</a>, Schelling's taking over the role of head of the Assassin’s Creed brand. He'll be responsible for the series "overall strategy and long-term vision" and has been credited in production roles on every entry since 2011’s Assassin's Creed Revelations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guesdon's been appointed head of content with his responsibilities being to drive "creative direction, support individual games, and guide the future of Assassin’s Creed while staying true to its core DNA". He's worked on the series since Assassin's Creed 2, serving as creative director for both Black Flag and Origins.</p>
<p>Finally, François de Billy's been bestowed the loft title of head of production excellence, so naturally he'll be trying to sharpen up and evolve processes on that end of game making. His Ubi tenure in production jobs stretches all the way back to the original Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Martin, Jean and François have collaborated closely on multiple flagship Assassin’s Creed games throughout the years, across creative, production, and brand strategy," Ubisoft wrote. "Over the next few weeks, they will transition from their current roles to formally join the Assassin’s Creed leadership team alongside Andrée-Anne Boisvert, producer for Assassin’s Creed’s cross-brand initiatives and head of technological excellence, and Lionel Hiller, vice president of brand and go-to-market Strategy, where they are set to steer the brand’s ambitious new chapter."</p>
<p>LinkedIn profile updates for the exec masses it seems. These moves come after former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">departed Ubisoft last year</a>. He's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-sues-ubisoft-for-around-1-million-alleging-his-exit-was-a-disguised-dismissal">subsequently sued Ubisoft for damages</a>, alleging he was left with no choice but to resign, having been offered new roles he viewed as demotions amid the round of corporate musical chairs that came with the formation of Vantage Studios.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-games-ranked/</link>
            <guid>1443976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil is one of those franchises that everyone knows worldwide. From the claustrophobic confines of the Spencer Mansion to a cold, isolated village in Romania, to a scorching setting in Africa, fans have seen and done it all. Thankfully, Capcom continues to make new games, and with new projects being developed, let’s tap into the past and rank the main Resident Evil Games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming is not ranking <em>every </em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> game, as we’ll be here all day. No one wants to know if the mess that is Umbrella Corps has enough T-Virus in the tank to fend off competition from Operation Raccoon City! No, 10 Resident Evil games are the subject of this ranked list, and it’s predominantly what are considered the mainline games in the series.</p>



<p>Controversy and cold takes are sure to ensue.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-resident-evil-mainline-game-ranked">Every Resident Evil Mainline Game Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-10-resident-evil-zero">10. Resident Evil Zero</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are always two immediate bones of contention for a Resident Evil ranked list: Who comes out on top, and who collects the Wooden Spoon. For my money, Resident Evil Zero earns the cutlery because it just isn’t that good, and one of the main reasons it’s <strong>borderline unplayable is the inventory system</strong>, which decided to do away with the traditional, magic inventory box system and have items be strewn around the game—leading to excessive backtracking.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Billy and Rebecca’s storage space is so small that you’d think every item you were carrying was the size of a grandfather clock. It takes ‘survival horror’ to an exaggerated degree, and it doesn’t help that Zero has uninspired enemies and bosses and doesn’t boast a compelling story. Only a remake, making necessary gameplay improvements, could improve its future standing.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-resident-evil-6">9. Resident Evil 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>You thought this would be last, didn’t you? Resident Evil 6 is <em>hilarious</em>. <strong>It’s so unhinged and unashamedly bonkers that you have no choice but to laugh at how outlandish and unserious it is</strong>. It’s no secret that Capcom’s fourth and fifth numbered games veered away from the intense survival horror aspects of the originals, but Resident Evil 6 goes so far off the beaten path that it ends up in Narnia.</p>



<p>The idea of multiple campaigns and the chance to use several iconic fan-favorites is a wonderful idea, but the execution is woefully hit and miss (mostly miss). Leon’s campaign is the clear standout, paying homage to Resident Evil’s roots, and it can be unironically enjoyable. If you cut Jake’s and Chris’ campaigns and extended Leon’s and Ada’s, there would actually be a pretty good Resi game here. Instead, it’s seen as the catalyst for change—causing Capcom to go back to the drawing board afterward, and if you want to have this in the number ten spot, I don’t blame you.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-resident-evil-3-remake">8. Resident Evil 3 Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Do you go with the remake or the original? Another question that applies to several entries on this Resident Evil games ranked list. For convenience and relevance, the remakes are getting the nod, which is why the Resident Evil 3 Remake ranks so low. There are just better games, for one thing, but the remake loses a lot of the heart and soul of the original—and content.</p>



<p><strong>The Nemesis encounters are terrifying</strong>, but few and far between, and feel quite inorganic. Also, why is one of gaming’s most distinguishable enemies wearing a giant bin liner? Jill is fantastic, and so is the narrative, and Nemesis will still make you change your underwear after every showdown. You might enjoy the original more, but here, the Resi 3 Remake comes in at number eight.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-resident-evil-village">7. Resident Evil Village</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Resident Evil 7: Biohazard was the game to get the franchise back on the rails, Village quickly gets bored and taps into the franchise’s bad aspects again. <strong>Village pretty much peaks once you finish up the Castle Beneviento</strong> portion of the game, and given how much hype there was for Lady Dimitrescu, her role is more stunted than it should’ve been.</p>



<p>Village looks and feels spectacular and leans more heavily into Resident Evil 4 for inspiration. You’re not short of action, but the game feels linear, and the story is somewhat disjointed. There’s also too much action again—we won’t even touch on Chris Redfield’s Call of Duty action sequence at the end of the game. Resident Evil Village is fine and fun, but it’s a definite step back.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-resident-evil-5">6. Resident Evil 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It needs to be said: <strong>This is the most underrated Resident Evil game</strong>, and it’s not even close. Five unfairly gets the flak for being the first true ‘non-Resident Evil game.’ Indeed, the sun-scorched tropics of Africa don’t scream dark, despair, and desperation, but the intense Manjini sequences instil a different breed of scares and tension.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-trophies-achievement-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Trophy List</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s antiquated control scheme shows its age, though, making some battles far harder than they need to be and frustrating. Lots of Resident Evil 5 involves fighting multiple enemies in tight spaces, and the tank-like controls can leave you wanting to punch more than just boulders. I also have to say how much I love getting the tiniest scratch, only for Sheva to blast me with a full First Aid Spray. Still, the game’s mission structure is a blast, and there’s some seriously good gameplay here—plus a decent story with appearances from Wesker and Jill.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-resident-evil-7-biohazard">5. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of my biggest complaints with Resident Evil games is that they have a tendency to fall flatter than a pancake toward the end. The first two-thirds of Resident Evil 7 are nothing short of exceptional, and it’s unbelievable how much tension and panic the new first-person perspective adds. Jack Baker’s dynamic AI keeps you on your toes, and it has some of the best boss battles in Resident Evil history. If you really want to hate yourself, play this in VR!</p>



<p>So, where does it go wrong? Ethan Winters is the most boring and non-descript hero (he improves in Village), the delicate pacing descends into a tired slog of combat once you reach the ship, and the final boss fight and ending overall are just such a letdown from the game’s promising early hours. If you savor the first huge chunk of the title, you have the most survival-horror-driven entry since Resident Evil 3, and it might be the best atmosphere Capcom has ever delivered.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-resident-evil">4. Resident Evil</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would be a crime to put this any lower. The original 1996 Resident Evil is the type of game that should adorn the hallways of any video game museum or archive. Its influence is immeasurable, and it managed to create a disgustingly tense and titillating experience with limited 90s gaming tech. However, this entry is based on the 2002 GameCube remake, as it remains the optimal way to enjoy it—for now.</p>



<p>The methodical pacing ensures you get a nice snippet of Zombie action with limited supplies before finding items, solving puzzles, and SNAKE-ing your way through the Spencer Mansion and beyond. The story is subpar as it’s finding its feet, and the legendary dialogue is so bad it’s…well, bad. Regardless, many of the games you play in 2026 have likely been influenced by Resident Evil in one way or another, and it remains a classic and staple of the survival horror genre it created.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-resident-evil-code-veronica-x">3. Resident Evil Code: Veronica X</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica was a system-selling monster that dwarfed many of its contemporaries at the time. Then, Resident Evil Code: Veronica X made some subtle additions, making it the most complete way to play Code: Veronica. There’s something special about getting a Chris and Claire story, and unlike Resident Evil 7 and 8, this is one of the best stories that actually gets better the further you progress.</p>



<p>Writing this list in 2026 is tricky because there’s a common complaint about the older games that rears its head again: Controls. It was a deliberate design choice by Capcom early on that grows very tiresome in subsequent releases—which is why recent games have been a delight with their freeing movement. The story really pulls its weight here and makes Code Veronica worth playing again…and again.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-resident-evil-4-remake">2. Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>

<p>Now for bone of contention number two: Resident Evil 4 or Resident Evil 2? It all depends on what YOU are looking for in a Resident Evil game. As this is Insider Gaming’s list (and my thoughts), I prefer brains over braun, which is why Resident Evil 4 takes the second spot. The remake highlights why the fourth mainline game was so groundbreaking at the time and still holds up. It seamlessly blends action, survival sequences, and epic boss fights, and delivers a compelling (and kooky) story throughout its extended duration.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s much longer than most Resident Evil games, giving you real value for money. Nearly everything about it is memorable: The opening village siege, the cart ride, the monster on the lake—it’s Resident Evil heritage. While the game is action-oriented, there’s still plenty of horror. Seeing a Garrador fills my body with panic, and hearing a Regenrator is still enough to make me want to turn the game off.</p>



<p>Babysitting Ashley does hurt the pacing, I’m not gonna lie. It’s one aspect of the game I always hate and dread, but regardless, this is a masterpiece.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-resident-evil-2-remake">1. Resident Evil 2 Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another masterpiece is Resident Evil 2: I haven’t a single bad thing to say about this game. When it was revealed that Capcom was remaking Resident Evil 2 with a new third-person camera, the Resi community went into overdrive. Yet, the remake keeps everything that made the original game so amazing, and I would argue betters it.</p>



<p>The puzzles are perfect, every location feels meaningful and suspenseful, and Leon Kennedy is such a likable protagonist. Where Nemesis feels sporadic and watered down in the Resident Evil 3 Remake, Tyrant (more commonly known as Mr. X) is a constant menace that keeps you on your toes from start to finish. With potentially four unique playthroughs to experience as Leon and Claire, there’s content for days. Capcom nailed the Resident Evil 2 Remake, and it brings home the bacon for this list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details have been revealed for Forza Horizon 6’s campaign structure, giving players a clear picture of what to expect from the open-world progression system when the game launches in May 2026.</p>







<p>The latest blog from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/playground-games/" id="87661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Playground Games</a> outlines how the campaign in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/forza-horizon-6/" id="2895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a> blends exploration and Festival challenges across a sprawling Japan setting. Rather than jumping in as an established festival Superstar like in previous titles, players begin their journey as a tourist with ambitions of joining the Horizon Festival and eventually becoming a Legend.</p>



<h2 id="h-campaign-focuses-on-growth-amp-exploration">Campaign Focuses On Growth &amp; Exploration</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Unreal graphics. Image by Playground Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Playground Games’ campaign approach emphasises progression through performance and discovery. To qualify for the Festival, you must complete Horizon Qualifiers and the Invitational to earn your first Wristband, unlocking access to curated races around Japan. As you earn more Wristbands by competing in Festival events, PR Stunts, and skills challenges, you will challenge increasingly demanding races featuring faster cars and varied terrain.</p>



<p>Progression isn’t limited to structured Festival competitions. Forza Horizon 6 also offers Discover Japan, a more free-form experience where you earn Stamps by photographing landscapes, completing side activities like Touge Battles or night street races, and exploring cultural hotspots. These activities reward cars, credits, and cosmetic items tracked in the game’s new Collection Journal.</p>







<p>Both paths—Festival Wristbands and Discover Japan—feed into campaign advancement, giving players flexibility in how they approach their journey. Reaching the highest tier grants access to exclusive locations like Legend Island, featuring intense events such as an extended Goliath race looping the full map.</p>



<p>The campaign is designed to play solo or in co-op with friends, with options to customise race conditions, vehicle selection, weather, and more once certain progression milestones are unlocked.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Pricing Details]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-pricing-details/</link>
            <guid>1443970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details have been revealed about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a>‘s Ringside Pass.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 has revamped the DLC process with a new Ringside Pass system. This is more akin to the Battle Pass in Fortnite than to the old WWE DLC model. Ringside Pass Season 1 will go live on March 6, when the game hits Early Access.</p>



<p>Players can purchase the premium track of the Ringside Pass via a premium pass, but they will still need to grind through and play the game to attain the unlockables instead of having the ability to unlock everything outright, as was the case in the past when players purchased premium editions of the game.</p>







<h2>WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Tier Skips Priced Similarly to NBA 2K</h2>



<p>A new video from Smacktalks on YouTube reveals further details about Season 1 of WWE 2K26’s Ringside Pass. The season will be centered around the AAA Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling promotion and feature four new superstars: Psycho Clown, Lady Flammer, Mr. Iguana, and El Hijo Del Vikingo. There will also be new arenas and championships based around AAA.</p>



<p>However, it was also revealed that players can purchase tier skips. However, it was noted to be priced similarly to NBA 2K, which is $1.99 per tier. Therefore, it would cost nearly $80 ($77.61) to skip all premium-tier options in Season 1.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-ringside-pass-seasons-don-t-expire">Ringside Pass Seasons Don’t Expire</h2>



<p>In some good news, players don’t have to rush to grind through and unlock everything, as the Ringside Pass Seasons do not expire. Therefore, players can still unlock everything at their leisure.</p>



<p>One of the game’s developers is confident that fans will enjoy the new DLC system overall. They believe that this allows for more content for the players. Read their full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide more news regarding WWE 2K26 leading up to Early Access. Early Access is a little more than a week away, launching on March 6. The game will be available to the global public on March 13.</p>

            <p>There are nearly as many people playing Valve's unreleased and invite-only game Deadlock on Steam as there  are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">people playing the resurgent Overwatch</a>. Deadlock was actually the sixth most played game on Steam in January in the US, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcdhiexi62r">according to stat-tracking company Circana</a>. It's an indication, if such an indication was needed, that Valve's next multiplayer game is shaping up to be something big.</p>
<p>Deadlock is a team-based hero shooter, hence the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> comparison, but it's also a MOBA. It's a mash of Valve's other games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, really. You pick a kind of 1930s gangster-inspired fantasy hero, then you set about earning cash while killing computer-controlled characters in 'lanes' so you can buy upgrades and power yourself up, and overwhelm the opposing team of players.</p>
<p>Deadlock was softly launched a while ago, in the autumn of 2024, and being Valve's next game, naturally had a lot of interest. But player numbers dropped off until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-major-update-new-characters-patrons">in January this year, a large Old Gods, New Blood update was released</a>. This brought six new characters to the game along with a new faster game mode, and overhauled a large part of the overall experience.</p>
<p>The effect of the update was dramatic, propelling concurrent player numbers from a highpoint of around 30,000 at the start of the year, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>, to a peak of 125,000 concurrents 24 hours ago. Overwatch, by comparison, has a current peak Steam playerbase of 134,000.</p>

<figcaption>This is a good overview - and player's guide - for Deadlock.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NyPdE6mL9s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Deadlock's numbers are all the more remarkable because you can't freely access the game. You need someone currently playing to invite you which, granted, is fairly easily done - plenty of streamers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NyPdE6mL9s">Deadlock-specialising creators are handing codes out</a> - but it isn't open access. It's also not being advertised or pushed by Valve in any way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">The Deadlock Steam page</a> doesn't have much information on it at all. Yet, people are flocking to it.</p><p>In many ways, it's not surprising. Valve's pedigree is unquestionable, with Team Fortress 2 arguably creating the hero shooter - a formula Blizzard borrowed and honed for Overwatch - and Dota 2 being one of the most popular MOBAs (and games full stop) in the world today. Dota 2's current peak concurrent player base is 830,000, which is staggering. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">the second most played game on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Deadlock currently has no release date, nor is there any word when it will be available openly to test and play.</p>

<p>Potential upscaling issues are being called out</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="67abd8e026ba1"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67abd8e026ba1/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Colour us surprised, and delighted, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> dropped last week. Silky smooth 60fps with updated textures and resolutions? Count us in.</p>
<p>And while, initially, we were in awe of how Mira looked on the newest Nintendo console, as time has gone on, and fans have been digging into the update, some are disappointed, reportedly asking Nintendo to refund the $5 NS2E, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-issuing-refunds-for-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-poorly-received-premium-switch-2-edition-upgrade">Eurogamer reports</a>.</p>
<p>The problems are largely related to handheld play, where fans speculate that a "filter" or upscaler has been used to improve the textures. But it hasn't really worked in some cases, with some saying that the game looks worse that the Switch 1 version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82zosnwh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvMtsLXxXMM">GVG</a> has highlighted some shimmering and texture issues throughout, both in docked and handheld — though the latter is much more prominent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHHuuGyOspA">SwitchUp</a> spotted some shimmering on character and enemy shadows. Depending on how sensitive you are to some of this, you might not notice too many issues, but there are some here, and many aren't happy.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/nintendo_is_refunding_xenoblade_x_upgrade_patch/">Reddit</a>, some have managed to snag a refund, with others claiming the Switch 2 edition looks worse than the Wii U version. We wouldn't go <em>that</em> far — and we think in docked the game looks and runs beautifully, for the most part — but it's clear people are unhappy.</p>

<p>Following our pretty glowing hands-on time with the game last week, we've since revisited Xenoblade Chronicles X on Switch 2 over the weekend and have spotted some of the larger issues ourselves; we've updated our thoughts on the upgrade since then.</p>
<p>Docked, the NS2E is great, and the 60fps boost might be worth it alone. And in handheld, we could eventually look past some of the bigger upscaling issues because we were running around so much. But when you start to focus in on some of the details, you can spot the problems.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tencent has Reportedly Shut Down Open-World Developer TiMi Montreal Studio Five Years After it was Founded, Without Releasing a Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-reportedly-shut-down-open-world-developer-timi-montreal-studio/</link>
            <guid>1443928</guid>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> points to the latest source of video game industry layoffs, this time coming from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-reached-record-sales-generating-10-billion-in-revenue/">Tencent</a></strong> and its <strong>TiMi Montreal </strong>studio. In this case, the <strong>whole studio</strong> is getting <strong>shut down</strong>, leading to everyone on the team seemingly losing their roles nearly <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/TiMi-Studio-Group-Opening-Game-Development-Studio-in-Montreal">five years after the studio was founded</a> with the intention of creating "<em>AAA open-world multi-platform games</em>."</p>



<p>Game File's report comes after a now-deleted LinkedIn post from one of the studio's programmers shared that the studio had been shuttered, with employees having been aware of the situation "<em>for some time</em>." They also added that they are "<em>genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing</em>."</p>



<p>Tencent and TiMi Group have not yet commented on the closure, nor has anything surfaced regarding what the Montreal-based studio was working on beyond its initial disclosure that it would look to make "<em>a AAA open world, service-focused video game for players to explore across multiple platforms</em>."</p>



<p>What we did know about the studio was that it was led by the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fired-ubisoft-director-ashraf-ismail-now-working-for-tencent"><strong>Ashraf Ismail</strong>,</a> who was fired from <strong>Ubisoft</strong> following an investigation into misconduct allegations.</p>



<p>This is now the latest bit of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoff news </a>from the video game industry in 2026, and the fourth studio shut down this year after <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/"><strong>PlayStation's </strong>shuttering of<strong> Bluepoint Games</strong></a>, Ubisoft's shuttering of its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Halifax Studio</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/"><strong>Hasbro's </strong>shuttering of its <strong>Atomic Arcade</strong> team</a>. </p>
