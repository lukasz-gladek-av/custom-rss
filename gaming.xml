			<p>A new update for a Cyberpunk 2077 mod that was released online this week makes playing the game with a modded third-person view better than ever by introducing some significant improvements.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, modder Tylerrrrr released the 5.0 version of their Every Animation Redone TPP Third Person mode, which improves V's animations while using a modded third-person view. Among the improvements over previous versions of the mod are proper effects when bumping against any NPC, fixes for vaulting and climbing animations, leaning and orientation, improvements for melee combat, and updated animations for male V. You can download the mod for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/16858?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the end of development, CD Projekt Red is still supporting Cyberpunk 2077 with new features. Last month, a new update introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-amd-fsr-3-bad-visual-quality/">AMD FSR 3 support</a>, which brings performance improvements but still leaves something to be desired in regard to visual quality. This is caused by the fact that CDPR did not implement the latest version of AMD's upscaler, which delivers much better visual quality compared to version 3.0.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, released last year, is only available on PC and current-generation consoles.</p>

            <p>Edwin and I have a sort of running 'joke', in that whenever we've got him down to review something, the game gets delayed. Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times. We've taken to calling it "The Curse", such is its power to utterly obliterate video game development, by virtue of it being a phantom that floats into PC vents and fries motherboards. I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>… but Edwin <em>had</em> played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an in-character post on Xwitter, the devs said that the game would arrive in "Q1 2025", as opposed to sometime later this year. Essentially, they want to "polish each phase of the project" and "ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible".</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Dear Mr. Dolski,</p><p>We regret to inform you that, after thorough review, your upcoming mission in search of Rapidium has been postponed from [REDACTED] to Q1 2025.</p><p>While we understand this delay may not be the news you were expecting, rest assured that we are using this extended… <a href="https://t.co/ALFaeTxG1G">pic.twitter.com/ALFaeTxG1G</a></p></div>— The Alters (@altersgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/altersgame/status/1841464246355345720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>When Edwin did get his mitts on The Alters earlier this year, it stirred the Gears Of War-liker within him - despite the fact it's about an offworld miner creating new versions of himself from branches of his past, then living with those alternate clones. He thought The Alters' opening salvo was similar to Cliffy B's magnum opus, despite the fact The Alters isn't so much about carving alien meatheads into pieces with a chainsaw gun, but more third-person adventure with a management focus. </p><p>"The encompassing level design harkens back to yer Uncharteds", Edwin said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-opening-hour-of-the-alters-feels-like-11-bits-first-third-person-narrative-action-game">his preview</a>, before he touches on the game's crafting and building focus. "There's still a War-Of-Miney side-scrolling management layer at the heart of it all… there are crafting and building menus to wrangle with, and resource counters to stay on top of."</p>
<p>And if you, dear reader, are wondering whether the offworld miner can have sex with himself. Edwin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">interview piece</a> on the topic covers that (fourth) base.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As members of RPS’s "nutritious", "life altering" and "it cured my oddly-shaped bottom!" supporters program (not actual reviews) will get to read about this Friday, I’ve recently done a 180 in my opinions of scrappy ‘nid stomper <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. That’s mainly down the<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc"> multiplayer</a> Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a>, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> mission.</p>

<p>The new Operations - 3 player co-op with several distinct classes and a pleasingly fleshed-out progression system - will land this month. Here’s how Saber describe it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tyranid invasion of Kadaku is ending. The planet’s organic material is being transformed into biomass, and Tyranid Capillary Towers stretch high into the skies above, where the Hive Ships wait to taste their victory. The Cadian forces have made a valiant attempt to push back against the Tyranids. A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>This’ll be the first of several planned additions to Operations mode this year, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fair-play-to-saber-space-marine-2s-roadmap-has-all-the-juicy-bits-for-free-although-sprucing-up-your-blueberry-mates-will-cost-you">per the roadmap</a>. Also set to arrive soon is a new "Lethal" difficulty, alongside a new pistol. It’s a 'neo- volkite', which sounds like a souped-up thermal sidearm. Saber also some bugs they’re planning to target with incoming patches, following a<a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/90-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-26-09-24"> fix released last week</a>.</p><p>They’ll also be some new enemies coming next year. Genestealers, please? I imagine they’re still in development, although we might find out what they are sooner than expected. As spotted by ours brothers-in-ziff IGN, dataminers recently found a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-datamine-reveals-unannounced-armor-pieces-including-the-beaky-helmet">few new armour pieces in the game files</a>, including the much-requested (and much cooler) beaky helmet.</p>
<p>
Lastly, the community post asks players to please treat each other respectfully. "You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be. Overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are. It could even be Henry Cavill. You don’t want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don’t."</p>
<p>Who says I don’t, eh? Oi. Cavill. Your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watching-henry-cavill-build-a-pc-gave-me-a-heart-attack">PC build disturbed Katharine Castle</a> so much she literally moved to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> several years later. Still, it’s always nice to see developers encouraging a healthy player environment. A lovely moral lesson if ever I saw one. Wait....morals?! Ugh! Quick, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-wont-say-whether-their-ceo-wrote-this-highly-baity-comment-about-games-imposing-morality-on-gamers">get daddy Karch on the phone</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Shattered Space, Bethesda's first major expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, released a few days ago, but has unfortunately been met with middling PC player numbers and lukewarm reviews.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1716740/charts/">SteamDB</a>, Starfield currently has a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of 17,074, and a current player count of 9,740. In contrast, Bethesda's much older release <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/489830/charts/">The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition</a> has a 24-hour player peak of 21,494, with 13,772 of us currently making our way through the fantasy world.</p>

</figure>
<p>Shattered Space's Steam reviews, meanwhile, currently sit with a "mostly negative" average. Many of these reviews claim the expansion is not worth its price tag, with several accusing the developer of being "lazy" with the storytelling and overall content.</p>
<p>"They say less is more, and with Shattered Space it's true. Bethesda's giving you less while asking for more money," reads one Steam review.</p>
<p>"Incredibly mediocre," another adds. "Was willing to give Starfield a lot of grace due to it being a new IP but now I've seen what they're doing to build on it, it's not worth it."</p>
<p>One positive review, meanwhile, is a very clearly backhanded compliment: "The story is boring af. Would recommend if you have insomnia and need to work the next day."</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x">Metacritic</a>, the expansion sits with a 'Mixed or Average' average critic score of 54, with a current total of seven reviews. Of these seven, two are positive, three are mixed and two are negative.</p>
<p>Some players are enjoying Shattered Space, however. "This DLC is more Starfield which, if you liked Starfield to begin with, means you will likely find it worthwhile," one Steam reviewer reasoned.</p>
<p>"If you normally enjoy the base game, it’s worth it, and, obviously, if you dislike the base game, then just stay away," another wrote.</p>

<p>As for the future, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> recently confirmed there will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">at least one more Starfield expansion</a> after Shattered Space, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-points-to-future-starfield-expansion-fans-believe">trademark for "Starborn" registered by Bethesda parent company Zenimax</a> then got tongues wagging about what any future DLC may include. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will feature two different control styles, but players won't be able to freely switch between them.</p>
<p>That's because the difficulty of the game will be altered to match the control style.</p>
<p>The game's producers Noriaki Okamura and Yuji Korekado were interviewed by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148">Famitsu</a> and discussed some of the new additions in this remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>.</p>

<p>The Legacy Style will mimic the original game with a top-down view and traditional controls, while the New Style will switch to a third-person perspective with modernised controls.</p>
<p>However, the development team found the difficulty level drastically changed depending on the chosen style - in particular the New Style has a wider field of view and allows Snake to shoot while moving, which made the game much easier to play.</p><p>As such, the two styles of play will be distinct as Konami alters the difficulty of each separately. Legacy Style will match the original, while New Style is being tweaked from scratch (presumably to match the difficulty, albeit with modernised controls). It means once players choose a control style, they'll have to stick with it throughout.</p>
<p>Other new additions include hidden collectibles alongside the original's kerotan frogs, and a quick function for camouflage for ease of use.</p>
<p>The game will also feature a visual filter to recreate the look of the original game - Konami previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-deltas-classic-visual-filter-usable-with-either-control-style-konami-confirms">confirmed to Eurogamer this can be applied to either control style</a>.</p>
<p>Still, when asked about a release date the pair remained silent. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">PlayStation blog post at the start of the year suggested a 2024 release</a>, but the producers told Famitsu while the game is technically playable to the end, they want to ensure the game doesn't disappoint fans upon release.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">hands-on with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> back in August, describing it as "a doggedly faithful remake" though the new controls could prove contentious.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"As the sole survivor of unexplained events in the 1990s, search for answers in an archive of photos rescued from the ruins of your childhood home, manipulate the past, encounter specters &amp; map your cursed family history," explains the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255140/CORPOREAL/">Steam page</a>. I, too, am a survivor of unexplained events in the 1990s. In my case, though, I'm talking about the Pog "phenomenon" and wearing T-shirts over long-sleeved tops. Whereas Corporeal, I sense, is all about murders, specifically murders in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It looks pretty nifty - at once chilled and chilling. The pictures must be dragged and dropped into the album manually, with descriptive text appearing alongside. I don't get the sense it's this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/immortality">Immortality</a> - which many journos considered GOAT material, though our Alice B (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/immortality-review">a little steelier in her verdict</a> - but I've always enjoyed the bits in horror films where somebody combs through archive footage and wait, that isn't great-uncle Percival at all, it's Aunt Maguire. You remember Aunt Maguire? She lived down Salem way, in that house behind the tarpits with all the ravens.</p>
<p>If you don't like cursed family albums, may I recommend Pip's (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/proteus-screenshots">album of Proteus snapshots</a>. If you do like cursed family albums, what would you put in yours?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Vessel of Hatred, Diablo 4's first expansion, officially goes live alongside Season 6 on October 7 at 4pm PDT globally.</p><p>During a pre-launch livestream, developers from Blizzard outlined the post-patch 2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR) changes, which touch on everything from progression and itemization to class balance and Runewords. Character level adjustments include Paragon Point increases, Torment difficulty updates, and Glyph upgrade changes.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/d4-1727945508088.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Realmwalker in Diablo 4. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Season of Hatred Rising sees the introduction of Realmwalkers (Diablo 3 players will be familiar), gargantuan heralds of Hell bearing sanguine-eyed portals on their backs dotted about Sanctuary. Here's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140803/conquer-colossal-foes-in-season-of-hatred-rising" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blizzard on the Realmwalkers</a>:</p><blockquote>Realmwalkers can threaten an entire Region at once, spewing out nightmares born of hatred from the portal fused into their bodies. By Mephisto’s will, a Realmwalker will spawn in a Region, and after charging up, it will begin to lumber about the Region in search of sacred ground. Realmwalkers are invulnerable during this phase, but fearsome Bloodbound Guardians will rush to protect the Realmwalker while it wanders. Eliminate them to remove chunks of the Realmwalker’s health.</blockquote><blockquote>When the Realmwalker arrives at the ritual site, it’ll slam into the ground, creating three Hatred Spires around it. Dismantle these spires quickly and render the Realmwalker vulnerable before it acquires too much power.</blockquote><blockquote>Once the Hatred Spires have fallen, you can finish the job. Put the demonic behemoth to rest! After the beast has fallen and glory claimed in your name, the truest test of your mettle begins: you may now enter the portal it leaves behind.</blockquote><p>As well as Season 6 details, Blizzard also ran though Vessel of Hatred itself, including information on new class the Spiritborn, an overview of the Kurast Undercity and Dark Citadel game modes, and a rundown of the new Mercenaries system.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1841538706747899908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Digging into the detail of class balance, Diablo 4 players are already saying Blizzard has nerfed the popular Lightning Spear Sorcerer build so hard as to be unviable, but of course fans won’t know the nature of the meta until Season 6 is in the wild.</p><h2>Diablo 4 update 2.0.2 patch notes:</h2><h2>Game Updates</h2><h3>Balance Updates</h3>All Classes<p>Legendary aspect affix values now have a separate cap between Ancestral and Non-Ancestral items. Now, the maximum values for aspects can only be found on Ancestral items.</p><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>Previously, max rolls of aspects could be found much earlier on. This made the transition into Ancestral items less exciting, as your aspects could already be maxed out before you entered Torment Difficulty.

Our changes address not being able to target farm specific Unique items on a consistent basis, loot rewards feeling lackluster, and the process of opening chests feeling tedious.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Greater Chest of Equipment cost increased from 60 to 200.</li><li>Scrolls of Restoration have been added to the loot table.</li><li>Chest of Materials have been reworked to consume all remaining Aether.</li><li>Chest of Equipment has been removed.</li><li>The Council Boss now drops guaranteed Legendary items with Infernal Hordes Affixes.</li><li>The Greater Chest now contains a guaranteed Ancestral Legendary.</li><li>Both the Chest of Materials and Chest of Gold now consume all remaining Aether rewarding Gold or crafting materials (including Masterworking Materials) the more Aether is spent on the chest.</li><li>The Item Chest has been removed.</li><li>Infernal Compasses can no longer be crafted.</li><li>Infernal Compasses are now rare drops found in Torment Difficulties only.</li><li>The number of waves will be randomly rolled on Infernal Compasses, and all runs of Infernal Hordes will have a maximum revive count of 4.</li><li>The difficulty of the Infernal Horde will be determined by the Difficulty Level (Torment I, II, III, or IV).</li><li>The number of revives is now limited to 4 across all Torment Difficulties.</li></ul><h3>User Interface and User Experience</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>A new key-binding has been added to change from run to walk.</li><li>Paragon Level now displays properly on character nameplates, such as in the menu or friends list.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Paragon Level now displays properly on character nameplates, such as in the menu or friends list.</li><li>Gems and Runes can be freely swapped without needing to visit the Jeweler.</li></ul><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>When trying to Socket a gem into a two-Socket item that is already full, the bottom Gem will be removed, and the new Gem will become the top Gem—think first in, first out. If you try to Socket a Gem into an item that has 1 or more Runes in it, all Runes are automatically removed. The opposite is also true when Socketing Runes into an item that contains Gems. Additionally, Unsocketing no longer costs Gold to perform.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Blacksmith Cache now requires 5 Forgotten Souls to craft.</li><li>Mythic Unique Item crafting has been adjusted.

This change fills that need. We've also created an avenue that allows you to target a specific Mythic Unique using Runes, giving more flexibility and progressive chase in your pursuit of Mythic Unique items.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Runes are now guaranteed to be dropped from the following sources<ul data-cy="list"><li>Boss encounters throughout the Vessel of Hatred campaign.</li><li>Whisper Caches</li><li>World Bosses</li><li>First time reward for clearing a Stronghold (magic runes only)</li></ul></li><li>Impairment Reduction will no longer appear on items.</li></ul><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>With the substantial increase to Impairment Reduction sources through Paragon, we found this was a good opportunity to improve the overall pool of Affixes on gear by removing Impairment Reduction as a gear Affix.</em></p><h2>Bug Fixes</h2><h3>Barbarian</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where the Rumble legendary paragon node had an inaccurate tooltip.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Brawl glyph didn't properly grant its legendary bonus.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Barbed Carapace and Tough As Nails could double dip, which resulted in extreme amounts of Thorns being granted.</li></ul><h3>Druid</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where the Druid Legendary Nodes Devastation and Thunderstruck did not function.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Lightning Storm Double damage tempering affix did not trigger off Nature's Fury.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the fourth Shred Strike from Aspect of the Agile would always critically strike.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Poison Creeper could be re-cast via One with Nature each time the player adjusted Paragon Points, Skill Points, or changed equipment.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Stormcrow aspect could make Ravens invisible.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the first attack of Shred didn't hit the targeted enemy after dashing.</li></ul><h3>Necromancer</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where the Abyssal Glyph did not grant its bonus damage to non-physical attacks.</li></ul><h3>Rogue</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where stacks of Advanced Flurry could be lost after healing, evading, or another Skill was automatically cast from an Aspect or Unique item.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the poison cloud from the Aspect of Poisonous Clouds could trigger Lucky Hits.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the visual effect and the actual area of effect did not match for Scoundrel's Kiss Rapid Fire casts.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the duration of Dance of Knives was shorter than intended.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Dance of Knives could become unable to be cast if the Skill was used repeatedly while no charges were available.</li></ul><h3>Sorcerer</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where certain Fire and Cold damage effects didn't work properly with Enlightenment.</li><li>Fixed an issue where automatic Frozen Orb casts from Fractured Winterglass granted Enlightenment stacks.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the increased chance to spawn a familiar was not displayed in the Familiar description after acquiring the Enchantment Master legendary paragon node.</li><li>Fixed an issue where free Frozen Orb casts from the Enchantment effect could be triggered when casting Skills on cooldown while Channeling Incinerate.</li></ul><h3>User Interface and User Experience</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where larger numbers could become illegible in vendor and crafter menus.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the description for Exquisite Blood did not properly display how many would be used to summon Lord Zir.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where the stealth effect for The Shroud of False Death wouldn't be broken by Mercenaries or Minions dealing damage.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Stealth effect for The Shroud of False Death could prevent a summoned boss from spawning.</li><li>Fixed an issue where summoning monsters at the beginning of a Legion event could be displaced when running into them with your Mount and using Spur.</li><li>Fixed an issue where progression could become blocked for The Eyes of the Enemy quest when trying to place Locran's talisman.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Guaranteed Critical Strike andOverpower from the Qax and Xan runes could be consumed by non-damaging abilities.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Legendary Aspects and Tempering Affixes that are not usable by your Class would occasionally function when using a Skill of another Class via Runewords. As part of this fix, Classes will no longer be able to equip items with Tempering or Legendary affixes that are Class-specific for another Class.</li></ul><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>We found an issue where Classes could sometimes unintentionally benefit from Affixes and Legendary Powers that are Class-specific for other Classes. An example of this would be a Sorcerer benefitting from War Cry legendary items that belong to Barbarians. We find the design space interesting, particularly with Runewords being added to the game, and may explore these kinds of synergies in the future. Currently, we do not believe it is healthy for players to farm items and Affixes on one Class to benefit a different one.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Various performance, UI, visual, and stability improvements.</li></ul><h2>Diablo 4 update 2.0.1 patch notes:</h2><h2>Key Updates From PTR</h2><h3>Game Updates</h3>Masterworking<ul data-cy="list"><li>The Gold cost for Masterworking Ranks 5-12 has been reduced by approximately one third.</li><li>Masterworking materials now drop from more sources inside Nightmare Dungeons, including:<ul data-cy="list"><li>Resplendent chests</li><li>Normal chests</li><li>Miscellaneous Interactive Objects, such as ambient corpses</li><li>Breakable Objects</li><li>The Butcher</li><li>Treasure Goblins</li><li>Local events</li></ul></li><li>Non-Ancestral Legendary items can now be Masterworked up to 8 times and have two Tempering Affixes.</li><li>Material costs for Masterworking at lower Ranks have been adjusted.</li></ul>The Pit<ul data-cy="list"><li>50 additional Pit Tiers have been introduced, totaling 150.</li><li>Bonus tier unlocks for fast clears have increased from 3 to 5 tiers.</li></ul>Loot Updates<ul data-cy="list"><li>Lower-level monsters will now drop more items, and less crafting materials.</li><li>Overall loot quality dropped by Hellborne has been increased.<ul data-cy="list"><li>There is now a higher chance to receive at least One Legendary item, with an additional chance to receive 1-2 more.</li></ul></li><li>Overall loot quality dropped by Treasure Goblins and The Butcher has been improved.<ul data-cy="list"><li>The Butcher will always drop at least 1 legendary item.</li><li>The Butcher will always drop the Butcher's Cleaver Unique weapon.</li><li>Treasure Goblins will always drop at least 1 Legendary item.</li></ul></li><li>World Boss loot now scales with higher torment tiers.</li><li>Adjusted the drop rates of Mythic Unique items from Ladder Bosses to compensate for being guaranteed Ancestral quality.</li><li>Duriel and Andariel do not guarantee a Mythic item drop but their chance to drop a Mythic item is twice as high as other Tormented bosses.</li><li>The chance for Uniques to roll as Ancestral has been significantly increased.</li><li>Starting in Torment Difficulty I, only Legendary and Unique items can drop. Any Normal, Magic, or Rare items that would have randomly dropped will instead be automatically converted into corresponding crafting materials.</li></ul>Runewords and Sockets<p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>We love the enthusiasm around combining Runes, but we understand many would prefer the optimal combinations of Runewords to have bonuses other than scaling damage stats.<br>Our original approach was to create a journey where both the Runes of Ritual and Runes of Invocation would eventually lead to Legendary Runes becoming the most potent, but in practice, this led to a handful of combinations being favored. Now, the gap in power between rarity tiers for Runes of Invocation and Runes of Ritual will be much smaller, and Runes that provide utility will be more potent than Runes that only provide damage across all rarity tiers.<br>Additionally, to make sub power Runes competitive, the Rune type will deal more than other types found in Diablo IV depending on the amount of utility they provide.</em></p><p>Lith (Don't walk or evade)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Previous: Stand still for 0.3 seconds.</li><li>Now: Stand still while fighting for 0.3 seconds.</li></ul><p>Feo (Become Crowd Controlled or Injured)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduce cooldown to 10 seconds.</li></ul><p>Vex (+3 to all Skills)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering increased from 400 to 1000.</li></ul><p>Kry (Spiritborn Vortex)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced from 500 to 300 Offering.</li></ul><p>Ner (Rogue Concealment)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced from 700 to 600 Offering.</li></ul><p>Jah (Sorcerer Teleport)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering reduced from 500 to 400.</li></ul><p>Qua (Movement Speed and Evade refresh)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Evade refresh removed.</li><li>Offering reduced from 400 to 50.</li></ul><p>Que (Enhanced Earthen Bulwark)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Changed to Base Earthen Bulwark.</li><li>Offering reduced from 800 to 300.</li></ul><p>Yom (Petrify)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Note: Petrify no longer gives Critical Strike Damage and instead grants 100 Resource.</li></ul><p>Ohm (Warcry)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering increased from 500 to 600.</li><li>Now uses base Warcry instead of Enhanced Warcry.</li></ul><p>Teb (Abhorrent Iron Maiden)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rune version now deals 300% of base damage.</li></ul><p>Tun (Stun Grenades)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rune version damage increased from 20% to 260%.</li></ul><p>Tal (Spiritborn Pestilent Swarm)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rune version damage increased from 100% to 150%.</li></ul><p>Xan (Critical Overpower)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering increased from 700 to 900.</li></ul><p>Eom (Generic Cooldown Reduction)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cooldown Reduction reduced from 0.25 to 0.1.</li></ul><p>Cah (Spiritwolves)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Enhanced the Spiritwolf AI allowing it to engage in combat faster.</li><li>Increased the Attack damage from 14% to 30%.</li><li>Increased the Leap damage from 14% to 50%.</li></ul><p>Zec (Ultimate Cooldown Reduction)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cooldown Reduction reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li></ul><p>Lac (Barbarian Challenging Shout)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduce rune version duration from 6 to 3 seconds.</li><li>Reduce offering from 800 to 400.</li></ul><p>Runes removed:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ur</li><li>Ono</li><li>Met</li><li>Kaa</li></ul><p>The following runes have had their icons updated to match their Diablo II predecessors.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ohm</li><li>Thul</li><li>Vex</li><li>Lum</li><li>Jah</li><li>Tal</li></ul><p>Updates for adding sockets to items:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Jeweler is now accessible at Level 1 instead of at Level 15.</li><li>Chipped Gems can now be crafted at Level 1 instead of Level 15.</li><li>Gem Fragments now start dropping at Level 5.</li><li>Socketing costs only require Scattered Prisms for Ancestral items.

		<p>On A Journey, a new turn-based RPG currently being developed by Mowlo Silk, is set in a world that has elements of the medieval era combined with lashings of steampunk. On A Journey’s demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2639150?snr=1_7_15__13">available now</a> as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">Steam Turn-Based RPG Fest</a> – drops you right in the middle of the story with a small group of revolutionaries on a mission to destroy cargo on a train, and derail it before it reaches the Capital City. The reason for this is twofold. First, it is to stop the transportation of Emerald Wood, a magic infused wood that helps prop up the power of the Queen, and second to destroy a prototype enemy mech weapon.</p>
<p><iframe title="On a Journey RPG (Game Trailer)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eq_Ex2kaUXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We joing Uther and Tristan as they jump on to the target train from a bridge as it heads towards the city. The scenario begins with you controlling Tristan as he makes his way across the carriage rooftops, a sequence that leads up to QTEs for certain actions. Failing a QTE can dump you into a bad situation, for example, mistiming the button press to push a couple of enemy Ya’al knights out of a train carriage ended up in a combat scenario instead.</p>


<p>Combat is a classic turn-based system with an ATB bar filling up for each character until it’s their turn to act. In addition to the standard weapon attacks and magic abilities, there’s also a fury bar, which grants a special attack to deal high damage with – Uther’s Fury is a storm which fires a lot of icicles at enemies, for example. Some enemies are weak to certain types of magic, which you’ll want to learn to exploit.&nbsp;Uther also has an additional&nbsp;Summon option, costing 200 MP and 50 Fury points, but it is worth it as it brings in a giant rabbit called Roger that rolls towards enemies causing area damage.</p>


<p>Building a well-rounded party to cover the various magic elements will be a key to success, and exploring the character menus shows that Mowlo Silk has plans for a lot of magic and Fury powers in the final game. You’ll also be able to augment them with accessories that can provide bonuses and buffs.</p>
<p>As you explore you will come across other interactive elements in the world, an exclamation mark appearing over your character’s head as you find them, giving you the chance to speak to characters, find collectables and more. On some of these, a struggle bar is a variation on the QTE theme, needing to be filled by pressing the correct buttons to do so, and sometimes with a timer to avoid failure.</p>
<p>On A Journey’s sound and visual design is a bit of a mixed bag right now. Character models come across as disproportionate due to their large heads, approaching chibi-style proportions, but not quite. Those are the main ones you’ll see as you explore the world, but battles switch to more properly proportioned characters with a lot more detail from their clothing to expressions. There’s an anime look about them which makes sense since the cutscenes are in an anime style.</p>
<p>The stage designs are very good with each having lots of details within them – passengers in the train carriages all looked unique, for example – and hopefully that amount of detail and variety will continue throughout On A Journey. Whether you will meet any of these characters again is unknown, since the mission you were tasked with at the start was to derail the train. That could be setting up an overarching theme of whether the ends justify the means, or I could be reading too much into it.</p>

<p>The main part of the demo ends with a boss fight against the mech prototype, with the outcome of the characters unknown after the battle concludes. The real end of the demo takes us back to before the events of the train, and to Sturdy Oaks village, which is famous for its lumber and baking. We find ourselves as a teenager names Lance, being woken up by his mum as he is supposed to go hunting with his dad. Uther, it turns out, is Lance’s dad, and Lance will no doubt head out on a quest to find out what happened on the train.</p>

        <p>Developer warns it will take action against toxic behaviour.</p>

            <p>The developer of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 has said it will take action to prevent in-game toxic behaviour, playing on beloved superfan actor Henry Cavill.</p>
<p>In the game's <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/93-september-community-update">latest community update</a>, Saber Interactive outlined the game's roadmap for the next year, and promised more bug fixes and tweaks are on the way.</p>
<p>Further, the developer asked players to be respectful to one another when playing online, following reports of toxicity.</p>

</figure>
<p>"It has been reported that some players were displaying hurtful behaviours or comments in-game. We do not tolerate that and will take action to prevent it," the update reads.</p>
<p>"First and foremost, we kindly ask you to remain respectful, mature and mannerly with your fellow Space Marines. You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be… overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are... It could even be  😏 ... you don't want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don't."</p>
<p>The update then includes an Instagram post from Henry Cavill, who's been busy playing the game and described it as "the mutt's...".</p>
<p>"Loving the PvP and am really looking forward to it growing and expanding - it has real potential to be absolutely awesome," he said.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Cavill is a known superfan of Warhammer - earlier this year he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-star-henry-cavill-says-warhammer-greatest-privilege-of-his-career">described his forthcoming Amazon television adaptation</a> as the "greatest privilege" of his career.</p>
<p>Still, whether these comments act as a deterrent remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-ceos-supposed-comments-raise-eyebrows-for-saying-games-should-be-about-glory-kills-not-imposing-morals">supposedly from Saber CEO Matthew Karch</a> suggesting games should be about "glory kills" instead of "imposing morals on gamers" raised eyebrows last month.</p>
<p>Saber has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-gets-more-helpful-and-effective-bots-private-lobbies-and-more">already updated the game</a>, adding "more helpful and effective" bots, private lobbies, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Leeds-based studio XR Games looks set to lay off nearly all of its staff, following the poorly-received release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a> VR: Reloaded.
</p>
<p>
72 people - out of the studio's 84 staff total - were told they were at risk of redundancy this week, according to a LinkedIn post by XR Games' former head of production on LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/hitman-vr-studio-xr-games-layoffs/">RoadtoVR</a>). Just 12 employees are likely to remain.
</p>
<p>
"This goes beyond restructuring," the staff member wrote. "I'll keep my thoughts and observations to myself. Today, my focus is on helping those affected."

<p>
Positions marked for redundancy look to include numerous development disciplines across the studio, including artists, programmers, project management, production, game design and IT.
</p>
<p>
XR Games is yet to announce the redundancies, and it's as-yet unclear whether the studio is planning to continue work on its other VR projects, such as Zombie Army VR and Starship Troopers: Continuum. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted XR Games for comment.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-thought-hitman-3-vr-was-bad-on-pc-just-wait-until-you-see-hitman-3-vr-reloaded-in-action">took a look at Hitman 3 VR Reloaded at launch</a> and found the game in a disappointing state, with poor visual quality, VR gameplay implementation and the removal of story scenes.

            <p>
Whenever I read the words "The Rocky Horror Show", I am swept into a time warp back to the fan screening I attended in 2005. Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.</p>
<p>Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC1E8yVJIS4">seek shelter in a castle</a> run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, the key thing, the important thing is: during the movie, there's a bit where the castle takes off and flies away. During the 2005 screening, the crowd all shouted "it's just a model!" at this point. I responded "shhhh!", and the hot girl sitting behind me sighed and said "tssk" and flicked me gently on the back of the head, much as you'd reprove a cat that is eyeing up your lunch. But here's the thing, lost lady of my youth: I wasn't actually trying to shush people! I was doing some clever cross-media humour! 
</p>
<p>
You see, there's a bit in Monty Python And The Holy Grail when King Arthur reaches Camelot, and somebody says "It's just a model" and is shushed by the other knights. That's what I was referencing, bygone attractive woman! I wasn't just trying to silence the Rocky Horror fans. The flying castle scene is right at the end of the dang movie - why would I have waited that long to intervene? Please, forgotten damsel with minimal respect for my personal space - please acknowledge that I am not a Brad or Janet. I am part of the clique. Please, if you're reading this, leave a comment and belatedly accept my adroit mingling of cues. That exchange has poisoned my soul for years. 
</p><p>
Oh hey! I've just noticed that Rocky Horror Picture Show is getting another video game adaptation. It's being made by FreakZone Games, a posse of retroheads whose works include the well-regarded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1300100/Spectacular_Sparky/">Spectacular Sparky</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/350780/MANOS_The_Hands_of_Fate__Directors_Cut/">Manos: The Hands Of Fate</a>. I originally wrote this post in my mood journal, but now I can publish it and profit from my long-petrified feelings of shame and injustice. Here's the trailer...

"Experience the strange journey of Brad and Janet like never before in this wild and wacky retro platform game adaptation of Richard O'Brien's legendary rock'n'roll musical," reads the blurb. "Jump to the left and dodge to the right in classic platforming action, along to 8-bit chiptune renditions of Rocky Horror's legendary songs." There's no store page yet that I can find. Will it have a flying castle scene? Will I ever be free of my sense of low-key humiliation and regret? You will learn the answer to at least one of these questions when the game releases, later this month. Alternatively, dig out your Speccy and fire up <a href="https://worldofspectrum.net/item/0004217/">the previous 1980s adaptation</a>.

            <p>In not quite six months since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> first burst its unapologetically bloody way onto our screens, the show has passed an impressive milestone.</p>
<p>As shared on the Fallout social media account, Amazon's adaptation has now been watched by 100 million viewers worldwide.</p>
<p>To put this figure into more perspective, Fallout is the only other show on Amazon Prime to cross the 100 million viewer threshold, the other being Rings of Power. The first season of The Rings of Power has, at the time of writing, reached over <a href="https://collider.com/rings-of-power-viewership-numbers-prime-video/">150 million viewers worldwide</a> since its debut, but with a much larger production budget.</p>

<p>On its release in April, Fallout quickly became a hit for Amazon, with scores of praise across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Our own Fallout review</a> called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain had nothing but praise for the adaptation</a>.</p><p>The first season of Fallout saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in over its first 16 days of release. This in turn led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's video game wastelands, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">Bethesda's Todd Howard</a> stating: "Depending on the Fallout game, you're looking at a 4-6x increase in daily players."</p>
<p>The show subsequently went on to receive several Emmy nominations, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">ultimately winning two</a>.</p> <div>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode-in-development-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode-in-development-report.999294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode-in-development-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Ubisoft is working on a co-op mode for the delayed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, a new report has claimed. 
</p>
<p>
Already in development before the delay and currently planned as a post-launch addition, Ubisoft is said to be creating the co-op mode as an optional extra.
</p>
<p>
That's according to the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/">Insider Gaming</a> report on Shadows' development, which makes clear the co-op mode wasn't the cause of Ubisoft's recent decision to hold the game's release until 2025. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft has publicly made no mention of a co-op offering for Shadows, which features two protagonists - the shinobi Naoe and the samurai Yasuke. The suggestion here, though, is that two players will be able to take charge of both characters and play side-by-side.
</p><p>
This would not be the first time Assassin's Creed has dabbled with a co-op option, but it would be the first in over a decade - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-unity-review">since the technically-challenged French revolution-set Assassin's Creed Unity</a> featured the option to play as four assassins side-by-side back in 2014. 
</p>
<p>
But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">the fallout from Unity's broken launch</a> tanked the Assassin's Creed series' reputation and sales figures, leading to a soft reboot of the franchise and a firm focus on it as a single-player series ever since. 
</p>
<p>
That said, we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-teases-past-assassins-creed-heroes-may-return-in-multiplayer-game-codename-invictus">Ubisoft is experimenting with multiplayer possibilities for Assassin's Creed once again</a>. Speaking to Eurogamer in 2022 about the franchise's future, Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté discussed Codename Invictus, a multiplayer-focused entry in the series that will hark back to the franchise's former multiplayer modes and likely feature various returning characters. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-staff-reportedly-pushed-ubisoft-to-delay-game-for-months">another report alleged that Assassin's Creed Shadows staff reportedly pushed Ubisoft to delay Shadows for months</a> to address concerns around game polish, feature tuning and narrative content.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Ubisoft for comment.

            <p>Any plans for the weekend, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> developer? Had a dog walk planned, did you? Nice little roast dinner? With the gravy? Spoon of mint sauce on the lamb, eh? Bit of pudding afterwards? Lovely little slice of pud? Lol. Lmao. No you didn’t. You absolutely did not, says Cloud Imperium. According to internal memos obtained by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/">Insider Gaming</a>, the Manchester (game?) studio have mandated its workers to pull two seven day weeks in the leadup to Citizencon on October 19th.</p>

<p>Via Insider Gaming, the memo contained a mandate to "double down over the next 18 days to make sure that once again we create an amazing experience for our community. This means for the next two weekends we will be mandating extra time for all those working on deliverables for Citcon."</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>All staff are to be in the office on Friday, October 4th and Friday, October 11th (typically a work-at-home day)</p>
<p>All staff are to be in the office on Saturday, October 5th, and Saturday, October 12th (for these days, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL (time off in lieu) which can be stored and used for time off at a later date</p>
<p>All staff are to work on Sunday, October 6th, and Sunday, October 13th (this can be a work-at-home day, but the company "encourages" people to be in the office. For these days and for those in the office, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL, which can be stored and used for time off at a later date.</p></blockquote>
<p>IG describe the mandate as "latest in a slew of ridiculous requirements" arising from "mismanagement". Where this gets especially dodgy is that, as per another memo obtained by IG, said TOIL - effectively working overtime for the promise of commensurate time off in the future - will only be made available after the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squadron-42">Squadron 42</a>. The single player component of Star Citizen was apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-sim-squadron-42-is-feature-complete-and-gunning-for-starfields-lunch-with-massive-new-video">feature-complete as of last year’s Citizencon</a>, but no release date has currently been confirmed. Star Citizen as a whole has been in production since 2011 - game development is an uneven process, but requiring staff to crunch at this stage seems borderline insulting.</p><p>The additional kick in belly is that "employees must still be employed with the company by the time the game ships, or the TOIL "will be forfeited." Cloud Imperium staff were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games-confirms-layoffs-as-former-staff-hit-out-at-relocation-plan">hit with layoffs this February</a> coinciding with an internally controversial relocation, including game director Todd Papy and lead designer Dane Kubicka. Back in July, Edwin reported on a senior programmer awarded £27,748 by a UK employment tribunal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">in a discrimination case</a>. Paul Ah-Thion, who is autistic, was let go in 2022 after his work from home requests were denied.</p>
<p>As of this May, Star Citizen has raised over $700 million in crowd-funding. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wing-commander-3-heart-tiger">Wing Commander 3: Heart Of The Tiger</a> is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">under a fiver on GOG</a>, and you get to fly the spaceships and everything.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Arco is about consequences. In it’s unique setting of the Mesoamerican frontier at the turn of the century, small choices can cause huge aftershocks. Some of that manifests in the story-telling, as you follow a dour journey of revenge, regret, and colonisation’s cruel effects on a native population. In other ways, those consequences manifest through combat, exploration, and seemingly simple conversations with other NPCs. All those elements come together to create not only a mechanically sound and well designed game experience, but an evocative one that challenged not only my tactics prowess, but my moral compass too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arco Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oft1Mwob7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arco is a western revenge story, but told from the perspective of the native peoples who so rarely get the spotlight in traditional spaghetti westerns and cowboy fantasies. Over five acts, you play as different characters with roots in various native tribes spread across the the land. You initially control a young Iyo boy named Tecolotl, who’s part of a family making their pilgrimage to The Sacred Tree to leave offerings. As the family makes their journey and goes about their usual habits of running errands and dealing with wildlife, though, mysterious people with ill intentions begin to appear near The Sacred Tree. As the tension these Newcomers bring simmers and boils before coming to a head, the story changes focus to a new character, but that undercurrent of a growing invasive threat remains throughout the duration of the game.</p>


<p>As act two opens, your perspective shifts to that of Tizo, a grizzled wanderer seeking out an old friend for some work. That one innocent job quickly escalates into a blood-soaked investigation into Newcomers who have been razing and looting native tribes all over – and Tizo takes up the task to deal with them permanently. Other protagonists follow in the next couple of acts, each with their own origins and goals. Each story that Arco tells is equally poetic and well-written, but each one establishes very different kinds of characters going on very different journeys. This makes it all the more rewarding when all of those journeys come together in the final act, and the way these various story threads link and feed into each other is so satisfying to see.</p>


<p>Across each of these acts in <em>Arco, </em>you’ll be digging into a blend of point-and-click exploration, dialogue-choice interactions, and incredibly unique real-time turn-based combat encounters. Each screen you explore in <em>Arco </em>is beautifully rendered in rich minimalist pixel-art, but those pixels can hide unexpected encounters and secret items depending on where you click. Some of these encounters will involve interacting with other characters, and the choices you make in these moments can have a lot of results – from losing HP after failing to de-escalate a confrontation to unlocking a hidden fight after getting a little too nosy about an overturned cart full of food. In some cases, having additional characters in your crew can even contribute to how well you do in these moments – in Act Two, I had a well-traveled hunter in my party who immediately recognized the tribe that some mysterious figures approaching us belonged to, and sternly instructed me not to wave to them, saving us from an unnecessary culture-offense and difficult battle.</p>
<p>Often, though, battles are inevitable. And frequently, they are incredibly difficult. Fights in <em>Arco </em>are a blend of fast-paced bullet-dodging and tactical decision making that will never give you an easy way out. Your goal in combat is to use your time while the action is frozen to predict where enemy attacks will land, position yourself to avoid them, and dish out attacks of your own based on where you think the enemies will be once the next turn plays out. Once your decisions are locked in, time resumes for a few moments as every character moves and attacks and you get to see how accurate your predictions were. It’s kind of a bite-sized strategy game where positioning is your ultimate resource and your biggest threat – some stages have hazards or traps, and ghosts will frequently come at you while you’re making mid-turn choices to deal damage to you if you take too long.</p>

<p>Almost every battle in <em>Arco </em>will have your brain firing on all cylinders to not only get through it alive, but with enough HP and resources remaining to ensure you’re capable of surviving the <em>next </em>battle that’s just around the corner. Resource management is just as much of a struggle as the battles themselves, and the scarcity of health and supplies really smartly feeds into the storytelling of a Mesoamerican people struggling to survive on the changing landscape of their once-familiar frontier. Arco so smartly blends all of these parts together, and the struggles of a difficult combat encounter or a punishing dialogue decision feel intertwined with the narrative struggles of your protagonists. It’s a strategically sad game, and punishing in all the right ways.</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be updated post-launch with a cooperative multiplayer mode. The rumor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Tom Henderson</a>, who has proven to be very reliable regarding Ubisoft games. According to Henderson, the mode is currently codenamed LEAGUE and was in development even before the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent delay</a>.</p>
<p>The insider did not provide any further details on the mode, although he underlined that this won't be the online cooperative multiplayer experience coming to the franchise. <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-servies-assassins-creed-red-hexe-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Invictus</a>, which is supposed to be a dedicated multiplayer game, is due to launch next year as well. However, early leaks point to Invictus being a completely different experience from your regular Assassin's Creed game. According to <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaker xJ0nathan</a>, players will compete in multiple rounds and modes, including a team deathmatch, a free-for-all, and a speed game where they have to get to glowing points scattered around the map. As they go through the rounds, players can select different powers to create a build. The gameplay is said to be arcade-style, featuring elements like a bubble shield similar to Super Smash Bros and a distant camera. Maps will be based on areas from previous Assassin's Creed games, and the only known playable characters so far are Ezio and Cesare Borgia.</p>
<p>As for Assassin's Creed Shadows, as mentioned above, the game was delayed from November 15, 2024 to February 18, 2025 in order to improve its polish and avoid the same fate of Star Wars Outlaws. According to Henderson, Ubisoft is also attempting to improve several cultural and historical concerns that were raised by fans, mainly surrounding the figure of Yasuke (who is, however, not going to be removed), but also some architectural details. Needless to say, a lot of Ubisoft's future hinges on the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows, especially after several less-than-successful game launches.</p>

            <p>Where's your asthma inhaler? Is it in your hand? Good, because you need it to stay alive in this horror game about getting stalked through metro stations by a tall creep that nobody else on the platform can perceive. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crowded-followed">Crowded Followed</a> is basically a playable <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/">It Follows</a>, the 2014 horror movie and overt metaphor for sexually transmitted disease. Only this time the slow but unstoppable entity is following you because you picked up a mysterious briefcase from a dying man in an alleyway. I thought I told you to stop accepting random bloodsoaked objects from strange men? Quit it! Anyway, there's a demo for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948790/CROWDED_FOLLOWED/">on Steam</a> if you like.</p>

<p>As you can see, that big lady is not stopping. The game sees players pushing past people who step in the way, scraping around for small change (to buy a ticket to get through a subway barrier), and slurping on that inhaler to keep a stamina meter up. Looks like the goal is definitely to channel the anxiety of a crowded space.  </p>
<p>It's coming out on October 24th, just in time for spooksday, and is being made by Night Dial, a Belfast-based horror developer (as you can maybe tell by the accent of dying alleyway man in the trailer). It features a scene that has you fast-walking your way through a riot in the streets, making this the second game release in one month that features the armoured police Land Rovers of Northern Ireland (the other being bicycle courier comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parcel-corps">Parcel Corps</a>). </p><p>There's also a bit where you push through a crowded nightclub to escape your paranormal pursuer, and if you look up and listen to the DJ, you'll realise it's Irish chiptune musician Chipzel, the artist who did the music for reflex-testing rhythm game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/super-hexagon">Super Hexagon</a> and dice-rolling roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dicey-dungeons">Dicey Dungeons</a>. This is a lot of Northern Ireland packed into one small space. Please, I need to get through. Excuse me, excuse me. Beep beep.</p>
<p>The game normally has two full stops in its name - Crowded. Followed. - but as with skateboarding sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a>, I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skate-heelflips-into-my-calendar-with-an-early-access-release-some-time-in-2025">refuse to adopt such punctuation</a> in game titles. It makes it hard to write sensible headlines. Please, we have trouble enough as it is with all the colons.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this isn't the only recent short-form horror game set in an unsettling subterranean train station. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-exit-8">The Exit 8</a> is set in Shinjuku station in Tokyo, and is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-exit-8-perfectly-captures-the-surreal-horror-of-navigating-a-busy-tube-station">alternately wacky and frightening</a>. And upcoming PS1-style horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> is set partially in London's tube. In real life, Ireland doesn't have a subway - it barely has functioning overground rail. But as a Norn Irelander who has survived the underground transport networks of London and Montreal, I can confirm that Montreal's is marginally scarier, mostly because of all the wet floors in winter. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It might not have been sitting in pride of place on your esports calendar, but the HCS World Championship tournament kicks off tomorrow in Seattle, Washington. This monumental esports event boasts a $1 million prize pool and will offer a grand stage upon which the most capable competitors in Halo history will compete for the trophy.</p>



<p>Last year, it was FaZe Clan that stood victorious in Seattle, having beaten OpTic Gaming in a dominant grand final fixture. The team went on to then win the London Major in June, but the squad <strong>is not </strong>the favourite to win the HCS World Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-back-to-back">Back to Back to Back</h2>



<p>As the Halo World Championship rolls in, high expectations are surfacing for Spacestation Gaming. Earlier this year, the squad made history with back-to-back Major wins, securing the top spot in both Atlanta and Salt Lake City. It has been a stunning year for the team, and the belief is that SSG is the number-one contender for the championship.</p>



<p>But that’s if OpTic Gaming doesn’t have something to say.</p>



<p>The OpTic squad, fronted by the legendary esports pro player, FormaL, has been one of the hungriest teams in Halo history since the HCS started back up in 2021. Here’s a summary of the squad’s most recent wins:</p>



<ul>
<li>HCS NA Super ($45,000)</li>



<li>Orlando Major 2022 ($140,000)</li>



<li>Halo World Championship 2022 ($400,000)</li>



<li>Charlotte Kickoff Major 2023 ($100,000)</li>



<li>Fort Worth Major 2023 ($100,000)</li>



<li><em>Halo World Championship 2023 – 2nd Place Honorable Mention ($220,000)</em></li>
</ul>



<p>It has been a trialling year for the OpTic team, though. Since the 2024 season kicked off, the squad has picked up <strong>five </strong>second-place finishes, falling to SSG <strong>twice </strong>in the Major circuit. It’s not for a lack of trying, though.</p>



<p>The Halo World Championship 2024 tournament promises to be an exciting event that’ll unravel over just three days in Seattle, Washington. From October 4 to October 6, these teams will compete through a Pool Play round before breaking into the Championship Bracket, with a best-of-seven grand final awaiting the potential victors.</p>



<p>This is the biggest event in the Halo esports calendar – are you looking forward to it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-1007-update-raunchy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade%E2%80%99s-1-007-update-has-made-the-game-even-raunchier.999228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-1007-update-raunchy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fans have started uploading comparison clips that showcase the changes made in Stellar Blade’s 1.007 update. The latest patch to hit the platform has made the game ‘sexier’, with ShiftUp focusing on physics that make outfits more revealing, as well as fine-tweaking how Eve’s breasts move with certain actions.</p>



<p>It has been dubbed the most important update for a game to ever be delivered, and it’s all in anticipation of photomode being added to the post-apocalyptic, action-fuelled romp.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-turning-it-up-to-11">Turning It Up To 11</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade never needed any help in the lasciviousness department – the slew of hyper-revealing outfits and the protagonist built around the body of a real-world Korean model ticked that box just fine. However, several months after the game hit the market, ShiftUp has taken things one step further.</p>



<p>In the below clip, you can see how certain changes have impacted Eve. With the addition of wind physics, certain outfits are ‘blown out of the way’ to get a closer glimpse at her behind, and when she leans into the camera, her arms boost her bosom to immeasurable levels:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Best Update Ever! Before &amp; After Comparison | Stellar Blade 1.007 Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9H0yVKKS_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>One fan labelled Eve ‘the most beautiful video game character ever’, and many have stressed that this update, however superficial, is enough to bring them back to the game almost six months after it was released. </p>



<p>Other changes and additions have been made in the recent update, though. For instance, players can now place pins on the map and restock their inventory in a much more intuitive way, and prompts have been added to stop players from spending all their money at once – which I did on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>Soon, Stellar Blade is getting a crossover event with Nier: Automata, which is sure to turn these elements up to <strong>12</strong>. That’s a level that shouldn’t exist. Let’s wait and see what happens.</p>



<p><em>Stellar Blade’s 1.007 update is available now exclusively on PlayStation 5.</em></p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 fans, rejoice – Valve has finally pushed out an update after several weeks of dead silence. Now, Counter-Strike 2 fans, despair! The update is centred around a battle pass system that doesn’t add much substance to the game and has already drawn negative sentiments from the CS2 community.</p>



<p>‘The Armory’ adds more than 100 items, a slew of weapon skins, brand-new gun charms, and a hot new case, but everything is ‘locked’ behind a battle pass structure that requires some serious grinding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-armory-in-cs2">What is The Armory in CS2?</h2>



<p>The Armory is a repository of new content in Counter-Strike 2, released by Valve in a major update published on October 3. The content in said repository is only accessible through the ‘Armory Pass’ system, which will require players to spend $16 on a pass. You can go above and beyond and purchase up to <strong>five </strong>Armory Passes, progressing through them all at once to maximise your gains.</p>



<p>When you’ve got an Armory Pass (or five), you’ll earn Armory Credits, which can be used to purchase the exclusive items in The Armory.</p>



<p>Items are expected to rotate in The Armory, and some items, such as the Heat Treated Desert Eagle that many fans have their hearts set on, are limited-time redemptions, so you’ll need to grind fast and hard to secure them. Unfortunately, it’s not a walk in the park, as many fans have criticised how long it’ll take to earn the credits needed to get anything ‘good’.</p>



<p>On Reddit, someone tested the pass and stressed that <strong>one </strong>Armory Pass earns around a ‘quarter of a credit’ for a 10-minute deathmatch, and it costs four credits for a collection skin.</p>



<p>There are more concerns, though.</p>



<p>The new Gun Charm system is pretty neat and it allows users to attach dangling charms wherever they want on the side of their weapon, but it costs $0.99 to<strong> remove </strong>the charms or switch them for something else.</p>



<p>There’s a substantial amount of content in The Armory update, but it’s mostly cosmetic. Outside of weapon charms shaped like sausages and FOMO skins that are locked behind a grind-wall, Valve has added new stickers, tweaked animations, and adjusted some quality-of-life aspects, addressing open concerns raised by the community.</p>



<p>The Armory update is available now in Counter-Strike 2. Do you think it’s a massive win for the community? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Red Barrels, the developer behind the psychological horror games Outlast and Outlast 2, has suffered what appears to be a major data breach, impacting the studio’s development work and employees.</p>



<p>The studio confirmed the cyber attack in a statement online on Wednesday.</p>



<p>“The Red Barrels team regrets to announce that its internal IT systems were recently impacted by a cybersecurity event, involving access to some of its data,” the studio said. “As soon as the event was detected, measures were deployed to secure the systems and the information contained therein.”</p>



<p>They continued: “A group of leading external cybersecurity experts has been mandated to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident. We also notified stakeholders potentially affected by the event and the relevant authorities.”</p>



<p>Red Barrels says that the investigation into the matter has been completed and the event is “contained”. Unfortunately, though, the company’s development plans have been negatively affected.</p>



<p>“The hit on our production timeline has been significant,” they said. “We will do our best to follow our roadmap but unfortunately, some things will have to be delayed. We’ll share a more detailed update on that as soon as we can.</p>



<p>“We take this event and the security of information within our care very seriously. Faced with a constantly evolving cyber threat, the studio will continue to implement appropriate measures guided by best practices to ensure a secure environment for our employees, partners and players.”</p>



<p>While Red Barrels didn’t detail what was hit in the data breach, Insider Gaming has learned about some of the data compromised. Based on the files sent, the perpetrators of the crime seem to have gotten access to various game source codes, game builds, human resource information, and even company credit card information. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming won’t publish the information sent from the breach, but it has been passed on to the proper authorities. As of writing, Red Barrels has made their social media accounts <a href="https://x.com/TheRedBarrels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">protected</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite is officially bringing back Trio Cash Cups. The announcement comes as no surprise after the game had officially announced next year’s competitive mode would be trios. Here is everything you need to know about Trio Cash Cups in Fortnite, including the schedule and prizing.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-trio-cash-cup-schedule">Fortnite Trio Cash Cup Schedule</h2>



<p>Trio Cash Cups are set to begin relatively soon, happening every week with a decently sized prize pool. However, there are multiple regions around the world that will have Trio Cash Cups, making the schedule a bit confusing at times. The competition will begin on October 4, 2024, and stay that way for quite a while.</p>



<p>All Trio Cash Cups are set to take place on Fridays and Saturdays in all regions, with the first week’s Finals happening on Sunday.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-trio-cash-cup-prizing">Fortnite Trio Cash Cup Prizing</h2>



<p>The prizing varies across regions for the Trio Cash Cups in Forntite, with the top 25 in each region winning money. Here is the official prizing for each region.</p>

Set in a version of Tokyo that has been decimated by countless demons, this stylish adventure lets you explore the metropolitan wasteland and explore a dramatic tale of revenge. While you've got the power to stand against the Qadistu and their dark designs, you can improve your odds by recruiting demons to your side. It's kind of like Pokemon, but with more apocalyptic overtones. This version of the game is also the definitive one, as it introduces numerous tweaks, changes, and quality-of-life updates to make it look, play, and feel better.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4377984-smt5vengeance.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377984" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4377984-smt5vengeance.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377984"></a><figcaption>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4377984-smt5vengeance.jpg"></figure><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fshin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-digital-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fatlus-rpgs-get-massive-price-cuts-ahead-of-metaphor-refantazios-release%2F1100-6526861%2F%3Fftag%3Dcad-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Deluxe Edition</a> is normally 10 bucks more than the standard, but Fanatical's deal drops the difference to $5.
