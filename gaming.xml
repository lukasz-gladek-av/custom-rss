		<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/08/killing-floor-3-delayed-until-later-in-2025-just-weeks-before-launch/">Killing Floor 3 was delayed just weeks before launch</a> by Tripwire Interactive following feedback from the closed beta. The team put it bluntly that after receiving the feedback they had missed the mark with Killing Floor 3, so would take more time to develop it. Today, Tripwire Interactive has confirmed a new release date for the game, and it is going to be July 24th. The announcement comes ahead of the studio’s PAX East panel where they will talk about the design of Killing Floor 3.</p>

<p><em>“Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3</em><em>, we’ve dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community’s feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision,”&nbsp;</em>said Bryan Wynia, Creative Director at Tripwire Interactive.&nbsp;<em>“The support from our fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we’re thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.”</em></p>

<p>Tripwire Interactive has brought back the ability to pre-order the game, having cancelled and refunded pre-orders for Killing Floor 3 when the delay came in March. We went&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">hands on with the Killing Floor 3 beta test</a>, saying <em>“Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design.”</em></p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will be released for PC via Steam &amp; Epic, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-systems-may-be-bricked-by-nintendo-following-%E2%80%9Cunauthorized-use%E2%80%9D.1185444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the attempt to combat piracy, Nintendo is apparently willing to go as far as bricking Nintendo Switch 2 systems following unauthorized use, according to the updated Nintendo Account Agreement.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/eurogamer-nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-remove-digital-licenses-and-or-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy.1185375/"> Eurogamer</a>, users should have received a new email recently informing them of the updates made to the Nintendo Account Agreement ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Though the wording differs between the European and the United States Agreement, the message is clear. In Europe, digital products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use, and unauthorized use of a Digital Product may result in the product becoming unusable. In the United States, the update states that the user acknowledges that if they fail to comply with the restrictions by Nintendo, the company can not only render the Account Service unusable, but also the device itself, in whole or in part. While restricting access to online services is nothing new, bricking an entire system seems rather extreme, and would create all sorts of legal troubles for Nintendo pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>Nintendo has always been among the video game companies that have fought the hardest against piracy, and they have ramped up their battle ahead of the reveal and the imminent launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Last year, the Japanese company went after the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu emulator</a>, which allowed users, among other things, to enjoy Switch games on PC with higher resolutions, higher framerates, and all sorts of mods. The other popular Switch emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, was also taken down last October. With the company now warning users that their system may be bricked, it definitely seems like Nintendo's war on piracy has entered a whole new stage, although it remains to be seen if the company will go to such extreme lengths.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab-brings-some-iconic-skins-later-this-month.1185441/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard and Capcom have announced an<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, bringing some of the latter's most iconic characters into the hero shooter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you won't actually be able to play as the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>fighters themselves; rather, they'll be arriving in the form of skins for&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>characters, with the skins roughly corresponding to the hero that best matches the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off a Dhalsim skin for Zenyatta, a Guile look for Soldier: 76, a Blanka skin for Winston, and a Juno look for Chun-Li, plus Widowmaker cosplaying as Cammy and a few others besides. It's all kicking off on May 20th.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab-ryu-cammy-chun-li.jpg?itok=2DSoITdG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab-ryu-cammy-chun-li.jpg?itok=dZbBaDY1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collab later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a full list of the skins revealed during the trailer.</p>

<ul><li>Winston - Blanka</li>
	<li>Kiriko - Juri</li>
	<li>Zenyatta - Dhalsim</li>
	<li>Hanzo - Ryu</li>
	<li>Juno - Chun-Li</li>
	<li>Widowmaker - Cammy</li>
	<li>Soldier: 76 - Guile</li>
	<li>Sigma - M. Bison</li>
</ul><p>As far as we know, these are all of the skins that are debuting as part of the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2 Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, although there might be a few fun extras to grab, like emotes or other goodies.</p>

<p>We also don't know what the skins will actually look like in-game, although we do get to see Hanzo as Ryu at the end of the trailer. Granted, he's not actually taking part in a match, but hey - it's better than nothing.</p>




<p>This is far from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s first crossover. The game has stepped outside of its own lore in the past to team up with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-season-7-reveals-diablo-4-crossover-tons-of-skins-new-map-hero-reworks" rel="nofollow">fellow Blizzard stablemate&nbsp;<em>Diablo IV</em></a>, anime&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-celebrates-one-punch-man-collaboration-release-with-new-trailer" rel="nofollow"><em>One Punch Man</em></a>, and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-reveals-collaboration-with-k-pop-group-le-sserafim" rel="nofollow">K-pop band Le Sserafim</a>. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>skins in&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>when they launch on May 20th across all platforms on which Blizzard's hero shooter is available.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> last year. Following its announcement, the developer confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>

Nintendo has pushed back on the suggestion that AI-generated images have been used in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.
</p>
<p>
The statement comes after eagle-eyed viewers watching the game's recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWjkbAQOGY8">Nintendo Treehouse livestream</a> noticed in-game billboards by the sides of the racetrack that featured artwork similar in appearance to that made by generative AI.
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World," a Nintendo spokesperson told Eurogamer.

<p>
The images in question include artwork of a bridge, used on a billboard in a city area. It includes wonky lines and oddly-placed elements reminscent of an AI-generated image.
</p>
<p>
A second billboard next to this one features a work-in-progress skyscraper, with strangely-orientated floors and pathways, again similar to an image created using AI generation.

A third billboard features an image of an oddly-shaped car with unusually large windows that, once again, looks similar to something created by generative AI.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that the version of Mario Kart World shown during the Nintendo Treehouse livestream was likely not the final version of the game, and it is normal for placeholder visuals to be present while a game is still in development.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see if these pieces of artwork make it into the game's launch version.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s key launch title will arrive on 5th June, alongside Nintendo's new console. I played an hour of the game last month, and came away hugely impressed. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World reinvents the series, and feels like Switch 2's killer app</a>," I wrote.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/katseye-gnarly-alice-longyu-gao-hyperpop-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>K-pop group KATSEYE dropped their new single “Gnarly” at the end of April, ushering in an edgy new era for the group. I think the song is a full on bop—but k-pop fans hate it.</p><p>KATSEYE is called a “global” k-pop group, based in Los Angeles and managed through a partnership with Korean label HYBE and the American Geffen Records. This allows for some welcome differences from how Korean groups are managed, in that the group’s members have a smidge more freedom in their personal lives. Recently, Lara Raj, one of the group’s members, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/katseye-member-lara-raj-came-out-as-queer-to-fans-on-weverse-im-half-fruitcake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came out as queer</a>, saying that she knew she was “half a fruitcake” since she was a kid. Musically, there isn’t much difference between this “global” group and other groups fully based in Korea. The group’s 2024 second single, “Touch” sounds to me exactly like a light, airy, Korean pop song, just with English lyrics.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="KATSEYE (캣츠아이) &quot;Touch&quot; Official MV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9CZykYZkOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Gnarly” is a little different. It’s not unusual for k-pop groups to change aesthetics with new releases—in fact, audacious changes for each “era” is part of the charm of following a pop group like this. “Gnarly” is much louder and more aggressive than “Touch,” with fuzzed out vocals and a loud, farty synthesizer running through the track. The girls even say “fuck!” Personally, I love the song. It’s a catchy little ditty about how a slang term can encompass many meanings, describing things that are both cool and uncool as “gnarly.” It’s perfect for screaming along to during a long night out.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="KATSEYE (캣츠아이) &quot;Gnarly&quot; Official MV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2-yomhYAj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Apparently, I am alone in this opinion. For the past week, as I perused my little k-pop subreddits while rotting on the couch, every time I saw “Gnarly” mentioned, it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1kb7hud/katseye_gnarly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans lamenting</a> how much they hate the song, expressing <a href="https://screenrant.com/k-pop-katseye-gnarly-single-disappointment-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappointment with the group’s comeback</a>. Teen Vogue has called it “<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/katseye-gnarly-meaning-behind-song-lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polarizing</a>.” When I looked at the lyrics on Genius, the top comment reads “<a href="https://genius.com/Katseye-gnarly-lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first and last listen I fear</a>.” Some people wondered if it was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kb946v/katseyes_gnarly_just_a_prank_cause_what_was_that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prank</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kbobsd/megathread_katseyes_gnarly_and_everything_related/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satire</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kbmzo1/im_99_sure_katseyes_gnarly_is_terrible_on_purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrible on purpose</a>.</p><p>One of the major complaints seems to be the lyrics of the song, which are pretty silly, but that’s never been a dealbreaker for a pop song from any country. Grammy Award-winning artist and <a href="https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should-have-been-Coachella-headliner Charli XCX</a> has a genuinely touching song on her breakthrough pop album <em>Brat</em> with the lyric “why I wanna buy a gun/why I wanna to shoot myself.” The lyrics “hottie hottie, like a bag of Takis,” to me, is no less silly than that. “Gnarly” is also a much more infectious ear worm than many other English language k-pop songs, lest we forget when Blackpink hit ‘em with that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHNzOHi8sJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ddu-du ddu-du du</a>.”</p><p>The negative fan reaction got so intense that Manon, one of the members of KATSEYE, said on Instagram Live,, “If you get it, you get it, and if you don’t get it, kindly, get the fuck away from us.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="manon’s response to the gnarly haters 🤭#katseye" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_7bgUhAHi8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The group later shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJFYX8IzlGI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video where they quoted a Nicki Minaj meme</a>, telling fans that they’ll like “Gnarly” better after a few more listens.</p><p>I think I understand the reason for k-pop fans' frustration, especially <em>these</em> fans, who are obsessed enough with these groups to talk about them on the internet all day. While k-pop can encompass a ton of different sounds and styles, the genre’s production style smooths out all the edges. K-pop functions a little bit like <em>Fortnite</em>, in that it is kind of a black hole that absorbs culture and remakes it in its own image. You liked that song “Water” by Tyla? Okay, well, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNexS61fjus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">k-pop version of an afrobeats song</a>. You like PinkPantheress? New Jeans released an entire EP that sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArmDp-zijuc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>a lot</em> like her whole deal</a>. At a very basic level, <em>all</em> of k-pop is a refraction of American hip hop and R&amp;B, to the point that a lot of groups have been criticized for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/k-pop-black-fans-creatives-industry-accountable-race" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appropriating black culture</a>. Some fans find that appropriation—which often comes with a serving of anti-black racism—is so extreme that <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/i-was-a-black-k-pop-fan-for-2-decades-unstanned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they have sworn off the genre entirely</a>.</p><p>I feel like I know what’s going on with “Gnarly.” This song is at least partially based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Sfer9-f3U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo by Alice Longyu Gao</a>, a songwriter who’s been associated with the hyperpop genre, which also encompasses artists like the aforementioned Charli XCX, producer AG Cook and gen-z maniacs 100 Gecs. The songs produced by these artists are all extremely aggressive and bold—and also have been extremely popular over the past year. Charli XCX’s <em>Brat</em> was such a hit that “brat summer” lasted an entire year. Instead of being a k-pop version of a hyperpop song, “Gnarly” kind of just <em>is</em> a hyperpop song, with all the sharp edges that come with that.</p><p>I asked Julianne Escobedo Shepherd, co-founder of <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing Things</a>, why she thought k-pop fans disliked the song. While she thinks maybe the Tesla namedrop in its lyrics has something to do with it, she thinks it’s mostly about how the song differs from other k-pop tracks, especially other tracks from the label HYBE.</p><p>“There’s definitely a HYBE sound,” she said. “It’s New Jeans: it’s very vibey, very demure.”</p><p>There is nothing demure about “Gnarly,” however.</p><p>“I think that ‘Gnarly’ probably grates because it is so aggressive sounding,” Shepherd continued. “It reminds me of some old Big Bang songs in the sort of dubstep gesturing. So I can see why some current k-pop fans are not feeling it. There’s also no singing, which is probably unpleasant to some people.”</p><p>All of these qualities are the ones that make me enjoy the song a lot. In fact, I think the song is a showcase for one of the most important qualities of a pop group in any genre: charisma. When KATSEYE perform this song, they perform the fuck out of it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrm7PP1mbtI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">down to their facial expressions</a>. When they say they’re the shit, I believe them. How gnarly.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-is-once-again-letting-capcom-and-everyone-else-know-that-he-would-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hideki Kamiya has found himself working with Capcom once again with the unexpected, but highly anticipated sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Okami</a>, but it's not the only game he wants to work with Capcom on.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-remake/">February</a>, in a video on his YouTube channel, in response to a question about remaking the first Devil May Cry game, Kamiya said that he would love to go back and remake Devil May Cry, and even added in that he wants to go back to Viewtiful Joe as well.</p>
<p>Once again, in a video on his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HidekiKamiya_Channel"> YouTube channel</a>, when asked the same question, Kamiya gave the same answer.</p>
<p>"<em>As for a Devil May Cry remake, of course I'd love to do that. I usually don't replay my own games after release, and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design. With today's technology and game design approach, of course, I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happen...well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes,I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="“**** remake?” “**** sequel?” &quot;Capcom—Please leave it to me!&quot; Comment Reply Part 11!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOBoqQCcRTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, it's not a surprise that he gave the same answer. It seems like he doesn't mind being asked the question, as it gives him yet another chance to very publicly declare to Capcom and anyone who will listen that he wants to go back to Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>DMC and Viewtiful Joe also aren't the only games he'd want to revisit, as he also previously said he'd love to work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/">Scalebound</a> again, if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya is one of the industry's most renowned and respected creators, who is partly responsible for some of gaming's most iconic and beloved series. It would be very interesting to see how he'd approach a remake for Devil May Cry, so hopefully someone at Capcom is paying attention.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-look-now-but-a-confirmed-gamer-is-leading-the-catholic-church.1185396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Yesterday's naming of Chicago native Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV—the first American-born leader of the Catholic church—has already led to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bennyheis.bsky.social/post/3loolfxng2c2a">plenty</a> of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/calliopeanim.bsky.social/post/3loot346axs2m">jokes</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pearlmania500/video/7502177512856816942?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-8wD5lhDRLCB">memes</a> about his potential interactions with various bits of American pop culture. And that cultural exposure apparently extends to some casual video games, making Leo XIV is our first confirmed gamer pope.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/brothers-of-pope-leo-xiv-share-their-reactions-239211077911">Speaking to NBC5 Chicago</a> Thursday, papal sibling John Prevost confirmed that the soon-to-be-pope played a couple of games just before flying to the papal conclave earlier this week. "First we do <em>Wordle</em>, because this is a regular thing," Prevost said. "Then we do <em>Words with Friends</em>. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world..."</p>
<p>OK, so the pope's love of casual word games doesn't exactly put him in the same category of people who are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/12-years-six-hours-and-23211-demons-defeating-one-of-doom-2s-hardest-maps/">speedrunning <em>Doom</em> slaughter maps</a>. But it's still striking to realize that the 69-year-old pontiff is among the reported <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2024-data/">44 percent of American Baby Boomer men who play video games regularly</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://civicscience.com/the-wordle-trend-is-still-going-strong/">15 percent of Americans aged 55 and over</a> who have played <em>Wordle</em> specifically<em>.</em></p>
<h2>A new generation</h2>
<p>In the recent past, papal interest in video games has usually taken the form of official statements decrying their potential for harm. Pope Francis, for instance, <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/francis-makes-rousing-call-millennials-get-couch-and-fix-world">warned in a 2016 speech</a> that young people should avoid spending excessive time on "a sofa that promises us hours of comfort so we can escape to the world of video games and spend all kinds of time in front of a computer screen." And in 2007, Pope Benedict XVI <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/pope-benedict-xvi-criticizes-violent-video-games">specifically called out</a> video games "which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 Is Exactly What It Needs To Be (Hands-On Impressions)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we've dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community's feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision," Wynia said in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">This correlates with the delay from earlier this year. In March, Tripwire also promised a post-launch update to Killing Floor 3 that will separate perk classes from characters. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-has-three-editions-physical-preorders-available-now/1100-6529177/">Digital preorders are live once again</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S storefronts.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-looks-like-2025s-killer-co-op-game/1100-6529407/">Killing Floor 3 could be this year's killer co-op game</a>, letting six people team up to take out bioengineered monsters called Zeds. It's set 70 years after Killing Floor 2, which was released almost a decade ago in 2016.</p>

                <p>Bam Margera has officially confirmed that he'll be in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-release-date-trailer-songs-game-pass/1100-6529971/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>. When the remakes were first announced, Margera's name was noticeably absent from the roster. In a video posted on Activision's social media channels, Margera teased that he'll be present in the game as a secret skater.</p><p>Why Margera wasn't included at first hasn't been revealed yet, but co-host Roger Bagley of the skating podcast The Nine Club (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bam-margera-will-be-in-tony-hawk-34-after-all-after-hawk-intervened-its-claimed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) did claim that Tony Hawk lobbied for Margera to be added to the game. Bagley added that there was no updated character model for Margera, so he was flown up to developer Iron Galaxy Studios to have his body and face scanned, footage of which you can see in the video below.</p>

			<p>All those who purchase the retail edition of DOOM: The Dark Ages on PlayStation 5 will need to download the full game to play it, according to a new report.</p>
<p>As reported today by Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPE</a>, users who managed to get their hands on early physical copies of the new entry in the series by id Software confirmed that the game box indicates that an internet connection is required to play the game, which won't even start without one. This is because the disk includes only a small amount of data, around 400 MB, and, as such, the entire game must be downloaded first. Making matters worse, as highlighted by PPE, is the fact that publisher Bethesda hasn't clarified the matter so close to the game's release next week, other than the complete waste of a disc to only include what presumably are only licenses to launch the digital download of the game.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages promises to ramp up the demon-slaying experience of the series to new heights with new mechanics and elevate it past that of its two immediate predecessors. Our review will be up shortly, but in the meantime, you can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/">preview.</a></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 15th worldwide.</p>

<p>For decades now, you could count on there being a certain rhythm to a Doom game. From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/doom-doom-ii-is-a-great-excuse-to-jump-back-into-hell-for-free-or-for-10/">the ’90s originals</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/">series’ resurrection</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/">recent years</a>, the Doom games have always been about using constant, zippy motion to dodge through a sea of relatively slow-moving bullets, maintaining your distance while firing back at encroaching hordes of varied monsters. The specific guns and movement options you could call on might change from game to game, but the basic rhythm of that dodge-and-shoot gameplay never has.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes in, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> throws out that traditional <i>Doom</i> rhythm almost completely. The introduction of a crucial shield adds a whole suite of new verbs to the Doom vocabulary; in addition to running, dodging, and shooting, you’ll now be blocking, parrying, and stunning enemies for counterattacks. In previous Doom games, standing still for any length of time often led to instant death. In <i>The Dark Ages</i>, standing your ground to absorb and/or deflect incoming enemy attacks is practically required at many points.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/">a preview event earlier this year</a>, the game’s developers likened this change to the difference between flying a fighter jet and piloting a tank. That’s a pretty apt metaphor, and it's not exactly an unwelcome change for a series that might be in need of a shake-up. But it only works if you go in ready to play like a tank and not like the fighter jet that has been synonymous with Doom for decades.</p>
<h2>Stand your ground</h2>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, <i>The Dark Ages</i> still features its fair share of the Doom series’ standard position-based Boomer Shooter action. The game includes the usual stockpile of varied weapons—from short-range shotguns to long-range semi-automatics to high-damage explosives with dangerous blowback—and doles them out slowly enough that major new options are still being introduced well into the back half of the game.</p>
<p>But the shooting side has simplified a bit since <i>Doom Eternal</i>. Gone are the secondary weapon modes, grenades, chainsaws, and flamethrowers that made enemy encounters a complicated weapon and ammo juggling act. Gone too are the enemies that practically forced you to use a specific weapon to exploit their One True Weakness; I got by for most of <i>The Dark Ages</i> by leaning on my favored plasma rifle, with occasional switches to a charged steel ball-and-chain launcher for heavily armored enemies.</p>

<p>In their place is the shield, which gives you ample (but not unlimited) ability to simply deflect enemy attacks damage-free. You can also throw the shield for a ranged attack that’s useful for blowing up frequent phalanxes of shielded enemies or freezing larger unarmored enemies in place for a safe, punishing barrage.</p>
<p>But the shield’s most important role comes when you stand face to face with a particularly punishing demon, waiting for a flash of green to appear on the screen. When that color appears, it’s your signal that the associated projectile and/or incoming melee attack can be parried by raising your shield just before it lands. A successful parry knocks that attack back entirely, returning projectiles to their source and/or temporarily deflecting the encroaching enemy themselves.</p>
<p>A well-timed, powerful parry is often the only reasonable option for attacks that are otherwise too quick or overwhelming to dodge effectively. The overall effect ends up feeling a bit like <i>Doom</i> by way of <i>Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!</i> Instead of dancing around a sea of hazards and looking for an opening, you’ll often find yourself just standing still for a few seconds, waiting to knock back a flash of green so you can have the opportunity to unleash your own counterattack. Various shield sigils introduced late in the game encourage this kind of conservative turtling strategy even more by adding powerful bonus effects to each successful parry.</p>
<p>The window for executing a successful parry is pretty generous, and the dramatic temporal slow-down and sound effects make each one feel like an impactful moment. But they start to feel less impactful as the game goes on, and battles often devolve into vast seas of incoming green flashes. There were countless moments in my <i>Dark Ages</i> playthrough where I found myself more or less pinned down by a deluge of green attacks, frantically clicking the right mouse button four or five times in quick succession to parry off threats from a variety of angles.</p>

<p>In between these parries, the game seems to go out of its way to encourage a more fast-paced, aggressive style of play. A targeted shield slam move lets you leap quickly across great distances to get up close and personal with enemy demons, at which point you can use one of a variety of melee weapons for some extremely satisfying, crunchy close quarters beatdowns (though these melee attacks are limited by their own slowly recharging ammo system).</p>
<p>You might absorb some damage in the process of going in for these aggressive close-up attacks, but don’t worry—defeated enemies tend to drop heaps of health, armor, and ammo, depending on the specific way they were killed. I’d often find myself dancing on the edge of critically low health after an especially aggressive move, only to recover just in time by finishing off a major demon. Doubling back for a shield slam on a far-off “fodder” enemy can also be an effective strategy for quickly escaping a sticky situation and grabbing some health in the process.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth tug between these aggressive encroachments and the more conservative parry-based turtling makes for some exciting moment-to-moment gameplay, with enough variety in the enemy mix to never feel too stale. Effectively managing your movement and attack options in any given firefight feels complex enough to be engaging without ever tipping into overwhelming, as well.</p>
<p>Even so, working through <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i>, there was a part of me that missed the more free-form, three-dimensional acrobatics of <i>Doom Eternal</i>’s double jumps and air dashes. Compared to the almost balletic, improvisational movement in that game, playing <i>The Dark Ages</i> too often felt like it devolved into something akin to a simple rhythm game; simply wait for each green “note” to reach the bottom of the screen, then hit the button to activate your counterattack.</p>
<h2>Stories and secrets</h2>
<p>In between chapters, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> breaks things up with some extremely ponderous cutscenes featuring a number of religious and political factions, both demon and human, jockeying for position and control in an interdimensional war. This mostly involves a lot of tedious standing around discussing the Heart of Argent (a McGuffin that’s supposed to grant the bearer the power of a god) and debating how, where, and when to deploy the Slayer (that’s you) as a weapon.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>I watched these cutscenes out of a sense of professional obligation, but I honestly tuned out at points and thus had trouble following the internecine intrigue that seemed to develop between factions whose motivations and backgrounds never seemed to be sufficiently explained or delineated. Most players who aren’t reviewing the game should feel comfortable skipping these scenes and getting back to the action as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The levels themselves are all dripping with the usual mix of Hellish symbology and red-and-black gore, with mood lighting so dark that it can be hard to see a wall right in front of your face. Design-wise, the chapters seem to alternate between <i>Doom</i>’s usual system of twisty enemy-filled corridors and more wide-open outdoor levels. The latter are punctuated by a number of large, open areas where huge groups of demons simply teleport in as soon as you set foot in the pre-set engagement zone. These battle arenas might have a few inclines or spires to mix things up, but for the most part, they all feel depressingly similar and bland after a while. If you’ve stood your ground in one canyon, you’ve stood your ground in them all.</p>

<p>Each level is also absolutely crawling with secret collectibles hidden in various nooks and crannies, which often tease you with a glimpse through a hole in some impassable wall or rock formation. Studying the map screen for a minute more often than not reveals the general double-back path you’ll need to follow to find the hidden entrance behind these walls, even as finding the precise path can involve solving some simple puzzles or examining your surroundings for one particularly well-hidden bit that will allow you to advance.</p>
<p>After all the enemies were cleared in one particularly vast open level, I spent a good half hour picking through every corner of the map until I tracked down the hidden pathways leading to every stray piece of gold and collectible trinket. It was fine as a change of pace—and lucrative in terms of upgrading my weapons and shield for later fights—but it felt kind of lonely and quiet compared to the more action-packed battles.</p>

<h2>Don’t unleash the dragon</h2>
<p>Speaking of changes of pace, by far the worst parts of <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> come when the game insists on interrupting the usual parry-and-shoot gameplay to put you in some sort of vehicle. This includes multiple sections where your quick-moving hero is replaced with a lumbering thirty-foot-tall mech, which slouches pitifully down straight corridors toward encounters with equally large demons.</p>
<p>These mech battles play out as the world’s dullest fistfights, where you simply wail on the attack buttons while occasionally tapping the dodge button to step away from some incredibly slow and telegraphed counterattacks. I found myself counting the minutes until these extremely boring interludes were over.</p>

<p>The sections where your Slayer rides a dragon for some reason are ever-so-slightly more interesting, if only because the intuitive, fast-paced flight controls can be a tad more exciting. Unfortunately, these sections don’t give you any thrilling dogfights or complex obstacle courses to take advantage of these controls, topping out instead in a few simplistic chase sequences where you take literally no incoming fire.</p>
<p>Between those semi-engaging chase sequences is a seemingly endless parade of showdowns with stationary turrets. These require your dragon to hover frustratingly still in mid-air, waiting patiently for an incoming energy attack to dodge, which in turn somehow powers up your gun enough to take out the turret in a counterattack. How anyone thought that <i>this </i>was the most engaging use of a seemingly competent third-person flight-combat system is utterly baffling.</p>
<p>Those too-frequent interludes aside, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> is a more-than-suitable attempt to shake up the <i>Doom</i> formula with a completely new style of gameplay. While the more conservative, parry-based shield system takes some getting used to—and may require adjusting some of your long-standing Doom muscle memory in the process—it's ultimately a welcome and engaging way to add new types of interaction to the long-running franchise.</p>

                <p>Sandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive have released Patch 1.2.3 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and it nerfs Maelle, a party member who can deal absolutely massive amounts of damage with the right character build.</p><p>Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG, and each <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-party-members-in-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-their-abilities/2900-6501/" data-ref-id="2900-6501">party member</a> acquired over the course of the game has a set of abilities that offer up a distinct playstyle. Maelle's abilities center around switching between Offensive, Defensive, and Virtuose stances to maximize defense or damage. But a powerful late-game ability called Stendahl was a little too powerful, and with the right Pictos equipped, players can deal several million in damage using this ability.</p><p>On May 8, the developers admitted that they made Stendahl a little too powerful and would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/" data-ref-id="1100-6531392">nerf it in the next patch</a>. Now that the patch notes are here, Stendahl damage has been reduced by a whopping 40%. While that's a pretty massive nerf, Maelle's Medalum weapon now doubles all damage in Virtuose stance.

			<p>DOOM Eternal is one of my favourite games of all time, and easily my favourite entry in the long-running id Software franchise. It’s the only shooter I’ve played where the end of every encounter makes me feel like I just finished jogging up the stairs for an hour. It’s a game that tests all your senses and fires all your synapses and locks you into a gameplay loop where you never. stop. moving. In DOOM: The Dark Ages, you need to stop moving. The game has swapped the jump and dodge action of the last entry with a new combat loop focused more around universal weapon utility, slower and steadier battles, and a melee parry system. It’s a wildly different direction, and while the result is absolute demon-blasting ridiculousness that’ll make anyone smile, it never quite reaches the same constant highs of the last game.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages Review – Tear 'em an old one" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iuTCe5ZVKos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages isn’t just a major shift for the series due to its new focus on stand and fight combat, it’s also far more story-focused and dialogue-heavy than the prior entries in this Doom reboot saga. Rather than telling a story that follows up on the events of the last game, we’re instead tossed deep into a prequel set hundreds of years earlier, in the time period only briefly touched upon in some of the story beats of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>. While the last game dipped a toe into those waters, this one does a triple-spin canon-ball dive right into the deep end. Back in this distant past, the titular Doom Slayer is in forced servitude to the Maykrs – a clan of robotic angels that are hardly concerned with the fate of anyone but themselves. The Doom Slayer gets to kill demons, but only when the Maykrs decide to let him. It’s clear their hold over him is waning, though, while the demonic threat facing the planet of Sentinel Prime grows and the Night Sentinel crew is thinned out in its defence.</p>


<p>And so, you rip and tear, but your reasons for doing so are muddier than ever in some ways, and more complicated than ever in others. The story of the Night Sentinels and Argent D’Nur is kind of eye-rolling sci-fi slop, but it’s the kind that’s so endearing in it’s cheesiness – and also endearing in how it never gets in the way of justifying the most ridiculous and heavy metal concepts for your growing arsenal of weaponry. Sure, this is some kind of Dark Ages adjacent sci-fi world where people ride mounts and swing axes, but they’re actually laser axes, and you get to pilot a giant robot, and also, does that dragon have jet-engines and shoulder mounted machine guns?</p>


<p>In the same sort of way a Godzilla fan might jump out of their seat when a new movie wheels out a reference to their favorite monsters, there’s something really exciting and endearing to the way this game builds up to reveals and moments tied into concepts and characters from the last game. At times it had me absolutely screaming. Just don’t expect an incredibly emotional or pathos-filled story to go along with those bits.</p>
<p>What you can expect, though, is a lot of action. Those frequent story scenes that bookend levels don’t take away from the fact that Doom: The Dark Ages is packed with over twenty chapters of demon-killing fun, even if the way you kill those demons has changed. Early encounters do a good job of introducing you to the new mechanics of combat, but it took hours to truly get used to them. I approached every battle expecting the same run-and-gun electricity of battles in Doom Eternal, but without a double-jump or a dodge button, I ran into frequent reminders that this Doom Slayer takes it slow and steady. Your general goal in battle is to mop up the grunts with gunfire, and then lock in your focus on the big, armoured enemy that you’ll have to engage with in a series of blocks, parries, and melee attacks. In the last game, you felt so much faster and stronger than anything you encountered, and the “rip and tear” tagline really made sense. Here, you’re engaging in rhythm-gaming and parry timing that feels far more methodical and measured – battles are no longer a sprint to the exit, but a consistent and evened-out journey to the end.</p>

<p>The thing is, it’s still so much fun. Parrying is satisfying with generous timings on standard difficulties, while and your gun options are more varied than ever, letting you mix and match tools for every encounter in almost any way you’d wish, though with key attacks attuned to each enemy. As you get deeper into the game and encounter larger hordes of enemies, that marathon of calculated parrying and pummelling becomes bliss. And while your tools of destruction are more measured in use, they are also the sickest tools ever – you’ll constantly sling your chainsaw-covered shield at opponents, then spraying projectiles into them from a gun that crushes skulls to use bone shards as ammo.</p>
<p>You have to applaud the reinvention, even if this change of pace never comes close to hitting the same hectic, exhilarating highs as the last game for me. It isfair to say that for a pretty vocal part of the fandom, that exhilaration I felt with Eternal registered more like exhaustion. Since this is a prequel, you don’t need to play Eternal at all to hop into Doom: The Dark Ages, and the massively improved accessibility options and weaponry make it easier than ever to get into the series. Each enemy has a particular weakness, but you’re never penalised for sticking to your two favorite guns beyond the constant need for ammo. Plus, alongside the usual string of colorfully-titled difficulty options, you can tinker with an array of meters that let you fine-tune everything from damage taken, to parry-windows and even the overall speed of the entire game. If Doom Eternal was a game for a specific kind of freak, this latest entry aims to welcome as many kinds of freaks as possible with open arms.</p>

<p>Now, on top of the experimental new boots-on-the-ground gameplay, there are also missions in Doom: The Dark Ages that go for more of a boots-in-the-mech or boots-riding-a-giant-cyber-dragon route. A major crowd will likely groan at the inclusion of non-shooting gameplay in Doom, of all games, and that’s totally valid. At some level, maintaining the integrity of that consistent non-stop shooter mayhem the series is known for is important, and it’s something I was just lamenting about this game lacking.</p>
<p>But, also… you get to pilot a literal mech and fly around on a dragon with armour and laser-wings and shoulder-mounted machine guns! These moments are silly as Hell, yet played so straight and tuned to the extreme that I can’t help but love them. In mech segments, you’ve got a far simpler toolkit of weaponry and a pretty simplified punch-and-dodge combat loop compared to the main gameplay. Mech attacks are intentionally slow, and while it adds to the experience of highlighting how huge these titans are, it’s definitely not as exhilarating as the already slower-paced gun combat.</p>

<p>Dragon segments are more mechanically dense, but also a bit rougher. You can fly at high speeds to track down moving targets and objectives, or you can enter Assault Mode to hover in place and fire your machine guns. You’ll be entering this mode a lot dodge the incoming attacks of enemies, but this locks you into an unnaturally rigid view where you can only dodge up, down, left, or right. It’s genuinely the one function in the entire game where I feel like the animation speed and weight is just entirely off. In comparison to the rest of the game’s gorgeously animated and masterfully paced cutscenes, combat animations, and glory kills, it’s a clear step below.</p>
<p>Another factor that PC gamers in particular will feel is the weight of idTech 8 and ray tracing on their gaming rig. We’ve played the game across two systems, one with a GeForce RTX 3080 and a Radeon RX 6800, and where these were capable of running Doom Eternal at 1440p, maxed settings (without ray tracing) and frame rates well above 200fps, the minimum bar for Doom: The Dark Ages now requires ray tracing support for the game’s core lighting. That puts a huge burden on the game, so that the 6800 is more of a 1080p60 card, and the 3080 wants DLSS upscaling to hit triple digits at 1440p. Obviously there’s newer and much more powerful cards out there now, but the use of DLSS and FSR upscaling with dynamic resolutions is going to be more prevalent here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-eternal-review" rel="nofollow">decisive conclusion of the Doom Slayer's story in <em>Doom Eternal</em></a>, id Software has decided to go back into the past to explore the origin of the only foe that Hell's demons ever feared in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. As one would expect, this means a change in scenery, more cutscenes, actual characters, and a positively medieval set of new weapons.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there's no drawn out process where you slowly work your way up from lowly grunt to demon slayer extraordinaire. In fact,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> throws you into the midst of yet another demonic invasion right from the get-go at the apparent height of the Slayer's notoriety. No time is wasted in getting the distinctive new Shield Saw into your hands either.</p>

<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>- Fantastic Weapons and Where to Find Them</h2>

<p>Unlike the special weapons featured in the previous games, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages' </em>Shield Saw is fully integrated as a key part of the gameplay loop. You don't need to collect fuel for it like the chainsaw, there's no practical cooldown period when using its abilities, and its upgrades scale relatively well throughout the campaign.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Shield Saw can be used to block the vast majority of attacks. If an enemy is far away, you can use the Shield to charge at them and turn yourself into a makeshift missile. Entire rooms of low tier enemies can be cut down by a single throw of the Shield Saw. Mid-sized enemies can be stun-locked to death before they have a chance to pose a threat.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-shield-upgrades.jpg?itok=biEXDoBc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-shield-upgrades.jpg?itok=z_DwxeNP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>With the right upgrades, you can turn into the most overpowered boss in video game history</figcaption></figure><p>Even higher tier enemies aren't safe as their armor can be weakened by gunfire and then stripped by a thrown shield. Other dangerous enemies can have their attacks reflected back at them. The best part is that all of this functionality is available to you without any need to touch the weapon wheel. In other words, it's a completely seamless experience that allows for incredibly aggressive gameplay.</p>

<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages'&nbsp;</em>guns feel almost quaint by comparison. You've got returning favorites like the Super Shotgun, a regular shotgun, a plasma rifle, an assault rifle, and so on, and they more or less function as one would expect. The new melee weapons (including your fists) are much more interesting as they are capable of inflicting debuffs and have some combo potential with the shield.</p>

<p>The same principle can largely be applied to the demons that you're fighting. The classic demons are basically unchanged while the new demons have unique designs and attack patterns. Coincidentally, the new demons really promote the usage of the Shield Saw's abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-bfg.jpg?itok=4oRgC7mJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-bfg.jpg?itok=s-R5uG2L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The BFG is back, now with 100% more flying limbs</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, a lot of the mobility mechanics that were a key part of the previous <em>Doom </em>games are simply gone. There are almost no platforming segments and dodging mostly consists of walking sideways. The Shield Saw does offer some mobility options for both combat and exploring, but you may as well compare an acrobat with guns to a tank, ice skating to boxing, or <em>Mario </em>to <em>Mortal Kombat</em>.</p>

<p>Cinematic executions appear to have been drastically toned down too, seemingly relegated to boss and mini-boss kills. The combat is fundamentally still the same, you just lose a lot of vertical and horizontal mobility in exchange for extreme forward momentum. Either way, to say that it's a noticeable difference is an understatement.</p>

<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>- The Doom Slayer Talks (Kind Of)!</h2>

<p>Speaking of noticeable differences, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>has far more cutscenes than any of its predecessors. There's generally going to be an intro and outro cutscene for each of the game's 22 missions, chronicling the story of the Doom Slayer and his time among the Night Sentinels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mechs-in-combat.jpg?itok=f90J_wlV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mechs-in-combat.jpg?itok=3-9jAi4w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amusingly enough, the mechs in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>use their fists as their primary weapons</figcaption></figure><p>Alas, there's only so much that the writers can do with the story given that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a prequel. It doesn't help that the Night Sentinel characters are drier than a desert. Hell has begun a full-scale invasion of the mortal realm and demons are about to kill everyone, yet the named Sentinels sound like they're waiting in line at the grocery store and it's raining outside.</p>

<p>One particularly egregious scene shows one of the named Night Sentinels literally being dragged into Hell along with the entire building that they're in, and for all the emotion in their voice, you'd think that they forgot to eat their ice cream before it melted. If you weren't paying attention to the plot, you might even miss the fact that two of the Sentinels are supposed to be directly related as they're not exactly acting like it.</p>

<p>Ironically, the named demon and Maykr characters are far more personable on account of their design and voice acting. Sure, they're not exactly going to be showing much character development, but at least their voices match the mood of the scene.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the playable areas have more flavor to them. You get to go to Hell of course, and it's the same fire- and gore-filled wasteland that everyone loves. There's also the Night Sentinel territories, which heavily lean into the medieval aesthetic mixed with elements of sci-fi technology. Later missions let you explore the realm of ancient eldritch beings too, predictably filled to the brim with tentacles, eyes, and nautical themes.</p>

<p>Most notably, some of&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages'</em> campaign missions let you pilot a mech and a dragon. These segments aren't particularly complex, and are admittedly more of a novelty than anything else, yet they prove to be adequate at providing some gameplay and visual diversity.</p>

<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-flight.jpg?itok=d0UxXqk_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-flight.jpg?itok=xu7V9trC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wouldn't an aircraft with missiles or lasers be more practical?</figcaption></figure><p>One can't help but wonder whether <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game" rel="nofollow">testing ground for where id wants to take the series though</a>. The mech and dragon missions, tweaking the combat mechanics to encourage parrying rather than dodging, even some of the narrative elements involving ancient eldritch beings can all be signs that the developers want to try something new.</p>

<p>In this case, new is not a euphemism for bad.&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>is quite the opposite, retaining the modern fast-paced gameplay that made its predecessors famous. The developers tried adding some new features, and while the story and voice acting is in need of improvement, everything else feels like a natural upgrade. The execution kills and dodge mechanics will be sorely missed however, and only time will tell if the aggressive gameplay offered by the Shield Saw is a suitably satisfying replacement.</p>

But through all those changes, there remain a few things I need in a <em>Doom</em> game to feel satisfied with it. A <em>Doom </em>game checklist, if you will. It’s not long, but it does make up the core of <em>Doom</em>.</p><p>You need lots of monsters and demons to kill. Levels with secrets. A badass shotgun. And you gotta go to Hell at some point.

And well, that’s exactly what Id Software has done with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-dark-ages-multiplayer-open-world-dev-interview-1851746527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-dark-ages-multiplayer-open-world-dev-interview-1851746527"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a></span><em>.</em> But if you were worried that this more open-world spin on the series wouldn’t feel like <em>Doom</em>, don’t be concerned. This is still a kickass and exciting <em>Doom </em>game through and through. It’s just that this time around, the Doomguy gets to punch, kick, and bash more of the demons than usual.</p><h2 id="h420674"><a id=""></a><strong>What is<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a prequel set before the events of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801?_gl=1*beeggg*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY3MzMzNjIkbzM2NyRnMSR0MTc0Njc0MTY4NiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801?_gl=1*beeggg*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY3MzMzNjIkbzM2NyRnMSR0MTc0Njc0MTY4NiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.">Doom</a></span><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801"> 2016</a></span> and its sequel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a></span><em>. </em>In those two games, we learned a lot about the Doomguy, his history fighting Hell, and the great wars between demons, robot angels, and humans that happened across dimensions long ago. It was all a bit much in a franchise that usually has narratives that can be summed up in a single sentence. “Doomguy is on Mars and fights demons to save the day.” Done. But with the newer games and now <em>Dark Ages,</em> Id is trying to tell a bigger, more complicated story and sadly, it’s the weakest part of <em>Dark Ages.</em></p><p>There are some cool moments sprinkled throughout the numerous (and sometimes lengthy) cutscenes. The Doomguy only says one word and does so in a very action-movie way that I liked. There’s also a great moment in which he’s asked to pay a toll in some underworld by a creepy figure, and just shoots him instead. Love that stuff. But most of the story in<em> Doom: The Dark Ages </em>concerns itself with people hunting for macguffins or for powerful artifacts to get the macguffins, and you’ll likely forget most of it by the time you reach the credits.</p><p>This is a <em>Doom </em>game! I should be killing stuff! Not watching people chat about power, war, and family. Thankfully, the gameplay in <em>Dark Ages</em> overcomes the floppy narrative and mostly forgettable characters.</p><h2 id="h420675"><a id=""></a><strong>Big battles and new toys</strong></h2><p>Because the story involves a big invasion of demons, combat in <em>Dark Ages</em>—unlike in the 2016 reboot and <em>Eternal</em>—often takes place in large, open battlefields and big rooms. The game fills these places with dozens and dozens of demons and lets you slaughter them all using a collection of mostly new and gnarly medieval-inspired weapons. All of them are powerful, loud, and a joy to use, like a cannon that shoots rusty nails and a gun that fires giant cannonballs attached to chains. One of my personal favorites is a machine gun that shreds up skulls and spits them out in a wide cone of death that can clear 100 weak demons in just a few seconds as you sprint around the 22 levels found in <em>Dark Ages</em>.</p><p>More familiar guns are here, too, like a plasma rifle and the BFG, which is now a giant crossbow that can clear an entire battlefield in one big green flash. And yes, there is also a shotgun. <em>Two</em>,<em> </em>actually. The standard semi-auto combat shotgun, which is a solid workhorse I used throughout my 18-hour playthrough, and the returning Super Shotgun, which might be the strongest shotgun ever in a <em>Doom</em> game. This two-barrel death-dealing shotty is able to rip mini-bosses apart in two shots or less. It’s wonderful. So, shotguns; that’s checked off the checklist.</p><figure id="" data-id="00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-recommend-id="image://00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Id Software / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-recommend-id="image://00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The big new addition to <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is Doomguy’s shield. You have this thing from the jump, and it stays with you for the entire game. And it rules. Being a shield, you can use it to block gunfire and fireballs, but you can also throw it at demons like a nightmarish Captain America. And because this is <em>Doom</em>, the shield is covered in saw blades, so it rips demons apart or sticks in the bigger ones. The shield can also be used to parry powerful demon attacks and energy blasts. This becomes a big part of combat as you get swarmed by massive demons during later fights.</p><p>Being able to counter their attacks and stun them opens them up for counterattacks with your melee weapon, also new to the franchise, and that loop never gets old in <em>Dark Ages. </em>I smiled every single time I blocked a big hell knight’s attack and then slammed him in the face three times with my spiked mace.</p><p>All of this isn’t just fun, but also important to the combat loop in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. Melee attacks against demons generate ammo, letting you use your guns on tougher foes or far-away targets. Shield tosses can stun bigger foes while you focus on fodder. And the shield charge ability lets you zip across the battlefield and close the distance on demons, letting you more easily punch them for more ammo. Or blast them away with a gun for health and armor. It all works together, and with an hour or so of playing<em> Dark Ages</em>, I found myself getting into a bloody ballet-like flow of blocking, dodging, shield tossing, punching, and shooting. And I was more aggressive than usual as the game rewarded me with health, armor, and bullets for doing so.</p><p>Unlike in <em>Eternal</em>, most enemies can be defeated with most weapons, so you are freer to kill how you want and not forced to use specific guns on specific demons all the time. That is, until one of the few super tough demons arrives and forces you to change things up a bit. But in those moments, I wasn’t annoyed as I was in <em>Eternal </em>when facing baddies like the Marauder, as these battles against minibosses with powerful shields and more health helped break up the pace of <em>Dark Ages </em>and they could still be defeated using most of my tools. I just had to focus a bit more and be careful.</p><h2 id="h420676"><a id=""></a><strong>A whole new world…filled with dragons and mechs</strong></h2><p>Beyond a new focus on melee combat and your shield, the other big change in <em>Dark Ages</em> is the size of levels. To be clear: <em>Dark Ages </em>isn’t an open-world game. It is still a series of levels you run through. But some of these levels are massive and filled with optional secrets and demon bosses to kill.</p><p>Most of the time, these secrets aren’t too involved. You might have to toss your shield at a hidden gear to open a door or break down a wall to find some hidden gold and armor. You aren’t doing side quests for random NPCs like in most open-world games. The Doomguy isn’t killing five rats for some leather or whatever. The open-world-ish levels are just filled with more optional opportunities to enjoy the excellent combat and movement in <em>Dark Ages</em> while earning some rewards. And these rewards will let you upgrade, improve, and modify your armor, health, guns, shield, and melee weapons. You can make the Super Shotgun even more powerful, carry more ammo, or add an augment to your shield that electrifies enemies around you every time you counter an attack. This upgrade system feels more streamlined than the one in <em>Doom Eternal</em>, which I’m thankful for, but I still feel that upgrade trees shouldn’t be a thing in <em>Doom</em>. It ain’t on my checklist, that’s for sure.</p><p>Speaking of things not on my checklist, let’s talk about big mechs and dragons. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> sprinkles in a few moments throughout the campaign that see the Doom Slayer ride a cybernetic dragon or operate a giant kaiju-killing mech. These aren’t a massive part of the game and are instead used to help add some variety between bigger maps and boss fights. I’ll admit that I was nervous about the addition of vehicle segments to the franchise, but Id has done a fantastic job of incorporating both dragon flying and mech fighting into the world of <em>Doom</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-recommend-id="image://14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Id Software / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-recommend-id="image://14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two reasons these segments work are simple: they’re easy to understand and wonderful to play. In <em>Dark Ages</em>, flying a dragon or controlling a massive robot was straightforward enough that, within a few minutes, I completely understood the controls for each. And Id has made sure that swooping around on the back of a dragon feels just as smooth as running and killing as the Doom Slayer on foot. Likewise, the mech feels powerful but not slow and clunky. And I must say, getting to uppercut a skyscraper-sized demon lord with a mech is one of the coolest things I’ve done in a video game in some time.</p><p>Another great thing about these segments: they don’t last too long, so if you don’t like ‘em, don’t worry, you’ll be back to old-school running and gunning soon enough.</p><h2 id="h420677"><a id=""></a><strong>Endings are hard, huh?</strong></h2><p>Something that does last too long in <em>Dark Ages</em> is the ending. For some reason,<em> Dark Age</em>s basically ends twice. There’s a big boss finale that builds in difficulty and tension near the end of the game. There’s a moment which I won’t spoil that made me hate the bad guy so much and fired up the Doom Slayer even more. It was wonderful. I dug my fingers into my keyboard. I was ready to fucking kill this big bad final boss after what he did. And I had a blast fighting him and ripping him apart.</p><p>And then, instead of ending the game there, the devs at Id Software added <em>one more </em>very massive level and two more boss fights. It’s not that the level or the boss fights at the very end are bad; it just feels poorly paced. And cramming a lengthy cutscene in the midst of it all didn’t help.</p><p>For a game that built momentum so perfectly throughout its entire run, it’s unfortunate that it ends with a whimper. Note for the future: When you reach the finale, end the story. Don’t do a second finale. Considering the fact that this game will get some DLC in the future, it will one day have the equivalent of three climaxes. I need more shotguns in <em>Doom</em>, not more finales.</p><p>Regardless of that mistake, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is still a standout example of how to take an old franchise and do something with it that feels fresh while still being true to the lineage of the series. And while <em>Dark Ages</em> has one too many cutscenes and endings, none of that ruins the frenetic and ultra-smooth combat, not even some bits in which you ride a dragon and pilot a mech. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a brilliant, bloody, and hyper-aggressive remix of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634"><em>Doom </em>formula</a></span> that works in more ways than it doesn’t. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"If someone experiences communication in GameChat for Nintendo Switch 2 not in line with the Community Guidelines, they can report it using the built-in reporting feature," Nintendo said.</p><p>The company also clarified that, apart from these scenarios, all recordings are "privately stored on device." No person recordings are sent to Nintendo "until a report is submitted."</p><p>Microsoft previously disclosed that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-live-will-let-you-share-voice-chat-clips-with-microsoft-to-fight-toxic-players/1100-6515906/" data-ref-id="1100-6515906">collects similar data</a>, claiming that it stores this securely. PlayStation party sessions and voice chat are also recorded to some extent for safety and security. In 2014, it came to light from the Edward Snowden leaks that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/british-spy-agency-considered-using-xbox-360-kinect-for-surveillance/1100-6418021/" data-ref-id="1100-6418021">a British intelligence agency identified the Xbox's Kinect camera as a potential surveillance tool</a>, but there is no evidence that any spying was ever done this way.</p><p>GameChat is one of the Switch 2's marquee new features.

Today it's worth asking—is the crowd interested in games inspired by the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the same playerbase that's grown to love parrying in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the recently-released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?

And players will quickly find in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the entire game is rebuilt around that one button.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The changes are quite complex—the rank-and-file developers at id have put a lot of work into answering the question "what if Doom Guy had a shield?" and the answers don't just all come down to the timing of a simple button click. Gone is the "dash" seen in the last two Doom games, replaced by a shield charge that closes the gap between the player and monstrous foes. Parryable attacks are telegraphed with a glowing green visual effect, and most of them take the form of slower-moving projectiles inspired by the "bullet hell" genre—and of course the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/doom-the-dark-ages-development-details-shine-light-on-the-state-of-modern-triple-a-production">conversations with the press</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, game director Hugo Martin and executive producer Marty Stratton referenced a desire to revive gameplay where players weave around slow-moving shots moving in geometric patterns, a trend that vanished in the shift to ever-more "realistic" shooters).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-stakes-its-claim-to-pc-gaming-handhelds-with-steamos-s-arrival-on-lenovo-legion-go-s" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve stakes its claim to PC gaming handhelds with SteamOS’s arrival on Lenovo Legion Go S</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That design decision is where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stands out from its FromSoftware-inspired peers, but the gravity of that dynamic stretches into the architecture itself—Environments are more tailored for circle-strafing around enemy creatures than racing forward to stay one step ahead of the bullet that might kill you.</span></p><p>Image via id Software/Bethesda.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The digital architecture is also shaped by this feature. Microsoft's admirable commitment to accessibility is present here in the form of deeply-configurable difficulty controls that let players adjust the parrying window to one that fits their ability. It also lets them modify everything from enemy aggression to bullet speed, to general gameplay speed, and beyond. These settings that can stretch the game so far it raises the idea that two players might go through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and have two very different experiences.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-last-humble-bee-postmortem-staying-sane-in-solo-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Last Humble Bee postmortem: Staying sane in solo development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the biggest gamble: the decision to prioritize parrying over online multiplayer. Mechanics that monitor precise timing are a perilous thing in online environments. It's not impossible—FromSoftware has made its name on allowing players to visit each other's games, either to help or hinder them in their quest for power. But the foundation of the Doom multiplayer doesn't favor collaborative monster-slaying or careful one-on-one duels. Ejecting the multiplayer element allowed id Software to build out unique control schemes where the player switches to piloting a giant robots and heavy metal dragons, but those setpieces are supporting acts for the main game loop—made possible by eliminating online networking, but not the point of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And forgoing online multiplayer is where we return to the business of investing four years of multimillion dollar development in a parry-heavy game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Without the feature that usually drives ROI on titanic games like this—will this direction prove to be the right one for the next Doom game?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Doom: The Dark Ages"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span>'s surprising competition: "boomer shooters"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the id Software team heroically toiled away for four years making the next great Doom game, a sea of other titles inspired by the original 1993 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have flooded consoles and PCs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These games—sometimes called "Boomer Shooters" include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">Selaco</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/">Warhammer 40k: Boltgun</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/519860/DUSK/">Dusk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and beyond. Plenty others have been flops, but the growing reception to them signals audiences have plenty of options to take in the gunplay of Doom games, but are drawn in by low-budget gameplay twists and unique settings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If one of these "boomer shooters" hit the market with a parry system built from the ground up, it would be less noteworthy—another swing at innovation from a small team. But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' parry system is an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>expensive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> parry system, recalibrating years of code, animation, and design to match a popular emerging trend. The R&amp;D into this tech came with improvements to the quality of 3D models (and an amazing reduction in load times), but those advancements don't have the same time to shine.</span></p><p>Image via Altered Orbit Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">id's other unique hook here is the promise of a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> prequel, telling the tale of the Slayer's time in captivity before the 2016 game. Given that boomer shooters have also played around with setting and minimalist narrative, there may have been room to search for a unique hook here too. If </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> used the new setting to springboard a more ambitious story—one that gave its silent protagonist more to do than glower at his captors—that hook could drive word-of-mouth enthusiasm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The medieval sci-fi/fantasy aesthetic is fresh, but still not that different than the straight sci-fi/satanic art direction of the last two games.

That isn't necessarily a knock on the story's quality or direction, but the familiar tone and framing seem in service of keeping players focused on a new kind of combat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's amusing.

            <p>Return to Silent Hill, the forthcoming film based on Konami's horror franchise, will be a "faithful adaptation" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to distributor Cineverse, which has acquired the rights for the film in the US for theatrical release (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/return-to-silent-hill-theatrical-release-1236391288/">Variety</a>).</p>
<p>Christophe Gans, who directed the 2006 Silent Hill film starring Sean Bean, will return for this new film, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">first announced back in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Said Gans: "I am delighted to partner with Cineverse, which has shown a genuine understanding of fanship. Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami's iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."</p>
<p>"Silent Hill is one of the best video game franchises period and Christophe Gans did a phenomenal job capturing the atmosphere of the games once again with Return to Silent Hill," said Cineverse executive director of acquisitions Brandon Hill.</p>
<p>As previously reported back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">Return to Silent Hill will star Jeremy Irvine as James</a>, known for his roles in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Treadstone and War Horse.</p>
<p>The plot will follow "James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads a press release. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."</p>
<p>The film is yet to receive a release date.</p>
<p>Still, it's good timing following the success last year of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, which faithfully recreated the PS1 horror classic.</p>
<p>"Against the odds, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer Silent Hill 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>By January this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">remake had sold over 2m copies</a> following its release in October. As part of its latest financial report, Konami yesterday revealed the Silent Hill series had total cumulative sales of 11.5m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima and his studio Kojima Productions have announced that upcoming open-world epic&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>has gone gold, and Kojima is celebrating with a time-honored Japanese custom.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hideokojimaen.bsky.kojimaproductions.jp/post/3lopyu7eyrk2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima posted a picture of the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>gold master disk. In case you're unaware, a gold master disk is the version of the game from which other copies are pressed, so Kojima's post essentially means&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is ready to ship.</p>

<p>Alongside the shot of the disk, Kojima also posted a picture of himself filling in the right eye of a Japanese daruma doll. Again, in case you're not familiar with the custom, a daruma doll's left eye is filled in when a goal is decided on, and the right eye is filled in when the goal is completed.</p>

<p>While a number of trailers have been released for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, the game's plot is characteristically abstract. It'll pick up after the events of the first game and will ask the question "should we have connected?", but the specifics and minutiae of the story are still unknown at the moment.</p>

<p>We also know that a number of characters will be returning from the first game, including&nbsp;Léa Seydoux's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on" rel="nofollow">Fragile</a>, Troy Baker's Higgs, and, of course, protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, portrayed by the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus" rel="nofollow">rather loose-lipped</a> Norman Reedus.</p>

<p>They'll join new additions to the cast like George Miller's Tarman, Debra Wilson's Doctor, and Luca Marinelli's Neil, and we'll get to find out how they fit into the story when&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches (although even then, given Kojima's past form, that isn't guaranteed).</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th (although a version for PC will almost certainly arrive afterwards, if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-is-coming-to-pc-after-all" rel="nofollow">the first game</a> is anything to go by).</p>
