            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/cat-quest-3-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Much like a band or singer-songwriter looking to shake things up and explore new aural delights for a third album, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cat-quest-iii">Cat Quest 3</a> takes to the high seas in search of a refreshing change of pace after a pair of medieval fantasy adventures. This time, the punniest action RPG out there is all about pirates and a quest of legendary booty of the North Star.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cat Quest III - Release Date Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5TQm1N8vuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a fresh tale of predestination and prophecies in Cat Quest 3, with the opening cutscene showing the Pi-Rat King sinking a ship on the open waters, with the only survivor being a kitten in a wicker basket. That little kitty is discovered by the spirit of Captain Cappey, who shepherds you through to adulthood and then journeys with and encourages you on your adventure of piracy across the Purribean. The good and honourable kind of piracy, though, where you’ll still deliver mail between NPCs and not just terrorise shipping lanes.</p>


<p>Of course, since you’re now a pirate, that means you’ll spend a fair amount of time on a ship of your own, which adds a new layer to the action RPG battling you’ll still find on land. It’s a nice, albeit light, change that still feels very much in keeping with the on-land action, though the ship has a distinct turning circle and momentum, and you’ll have to manage its own set of upgrades.</p>


<p>While it’s perfectly in keeping with the rest of the game, I did wish for a little more depth to the ship combat though. Your cannons auto-aim within an arc before you, instead of having broadside batteries like you might expect, so it actually feels more like you’re dogfighting in planes instead of ships – strangely, even the most basic enemy ships have full 360º aiming. It’s also a pain that you can’t repair your ship without it first being destroyed, which you have to swim next to in your life preserver for a few moments to restore. Racing away to get back to a little jetty and summoning your ship just brings it back to you in the same condition, so where you have a spell to heal up your kitty between rest point cat naps, it’s the ship is more restrictive feeling.</p>
<p>Of course, the bulk of the action still takes place on land – which still has the same kind of scale as a traditional RPG overworld – and this is a solid iteration on the previous two games. You now have a main melee weapon with a secondary gun or wand to switch to (as opposed to swapping characters) and can equip up to four magic spells, with spell slots being charged up by your regular attacks.</p>

<p>It’s all nice and simplistic, and allows you to focus more on the enemies that you’re facing and dodging their attacks, whether it’s a pi-rat butt stomp, a hog charge attack, swooping bird or various elemental enemies. While it’s hardly Dark Souls difficulty, the combat’s got some claws to watch out for and I personally found it can be deceptively easy to get carried away and take a lot of damage. Boss battles all feel nice and distinct, and will often push you in a new direction, whether that’s making use of elemental weapons or leaning more on ranged attacks and magic – if ever I was taking the wrong approach to an enemy, a few deaths would have me buck up my ideas!</p>
<p>The loot you gather on your adventure is kept simple and to the point. There’s a menagerie of different hats and armour, as well as a variety of swords, axes, shields and guns, but instead of Diablo-esque loot where everything has different stat rolls, once you’ve got something, it can stay with you through the full adventure. Pick up a duplicate and it will bump up the level of your existing gear, and if you feel you need a little bit more juice in your attacks, you can head back to the one main port in the game and throw money and magic crystals to level up anything you’ve got.</p>
<p>As in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/30/cat-quest-ii-review/">Cat Quest 2</a>, all of this can be played in co-op, which is a nice and fun inclusion, though one I only dabbled with briefly while reviewing. It means you’ve got a little bit of slack in battle, as your buddy can come and pick you back up – just beware of getting hit while you’re stationary – and you can kit yourselves out with complimentary gear, and you’ll have to since you’re sharing an inventory. It does generally help to chop and change between different elements at times, so the ice wand lets you dodge through fire damage, while the shields are great for blocking rolling enemies and damaging them back. The main oddity in co-op is that you only get one ship,which is fine, but unusual when you can both control the same vessel.</p>

<p>You can quite quickly rattle through the main quest and story of the game, with your kitty chasing after the Pi-rat King, hunting down ancient keys and the like, but there’s a bunch of side quests like delivering mail, catching catfish, hunting down books, and optional dungeons with bounties to collect. All of the story is delivered with the same kind of pitch purrfect punning that’s positively pawesome, and there’s a good dose of foreshadowing for later twists, and callbacks to the overarching narrative of the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>roadmap, so now you know what kind of content you can look forward to from this single-player adventure over the next year or so.</p>
<p>The season pass includes a mission that's exclusive to&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>' Season Pass, as well as a character pack, two cosmetic bundles, and two major story expansions, which takes us up to spring next year.</p>
<p>If you've been keeping up with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>news, you'll probably recognize the exclusive mission, which is "Jabba's Gambit". Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-jabba-season-pass-ubisoft">made sure to clarify</a> back in April that this mission isn't the only chance you'll get to see Jabba the Hutt.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=o5B0IkZG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=7XUAp9RZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't worry,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>fans: you're getting plenty of content this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Both the Jabba's Gambit mission pack and the Kessel Runner cosmetic pack, which contains cosmetics for Kay and her buddy Nix, are coming on launch day.</p>
<p>Following that, this fall, you'll get the first&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>story DLC in the form of&nbsp;<em>Wild Card</em>, which will see Kay crossing paths with Lando Calrissian as she infiltrates a Sabacc tournament.</p>
<p>If you're a Season Pass holder, you'll also get two cosmetic bundles, both of which contain new looks for Kay, Nix, your speeder, and the Trailblazer ship.</p>
<p>Lastly for this roadmap,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, the second&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>story DLC pack, is coming in spring next year. It'll see Kay meeting up with pirate Hondo Ohnaka and taking on a "ruthless gang of pirates" alongside him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-kay.jpg?itok=I-6lEwaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-kay.jpg?itok=NEa9XZ5g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is due to land later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not this is the last we'll hear of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>after launch remains to be seen, but given how high-profile both the game and its IP are, I wouldn't bet on it.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/star-wars-outlaws/645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 30th</a>. It's Ubisoft's open-world foray into the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe, and it combines traversal across a range of beautiful&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>worlds with third-person shooting, stealth, and climbing-based platforming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-august-line-up-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft has announced its next lineup of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass over the first half of August, and it's headlined by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-nostalgia-done-right-and-that-includes-the-irritations">Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy</a>.
</p>
<p>
Is this one game? Is this technically three? Regardless, get ready to play (or replay) Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped on cloud, console and PC from this Thursday 8th August. 
</p>
<p>
Coming to Xbox Game Pass this month:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creatures of Ava (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) - 7th August </li>
<li>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 8th August </li>
<li>Mafia: Definitive Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 13th August</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's not a long list of games, to be sure, but if you're yet to try the souped up Mafia remake then that is definitely worth a look. A ground-up rebuilding of the first Mafia tale, this takes place in 1930s America and sees Tommy-gun-toting title character Tommy Angelo trying to make his way in a world of organised crime. 
</p>
<p>"A mostly thorough remake of 2002's original, Mafia: Definitive Edition has its moments - but it struggles by the standards of today," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-definitive-edition-review-a-generous-remake-that-still-shows-some-age">Eurogamer's Mafia: Definitive Edition review</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/action-adventure-critter-saving-game-creatures-of-ava-releases-later-this-year">Creatures of Ava</a>, meanwhile, launches in to Game Pass this week. This colourful creature-saving fantasy action-adventure looks like it could be something special. It's co-developed by Spanish indie studios Inverse and Chibig, with Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett involved in creating the narrative.

The original games were punishing, and if anything, the trilogy ups some of the challenge in certain ways.

Finally, <em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s 2v8 game mode is available to try on the service until August 8. <em>Valorant </em>isn’t part of Game Pass, but it is free-to-play and shadow dropped on console yesterday, in case you needed a new hero-based tactical shooter to add to your rotation. </p><p>  <em>N.

It seems like instead of blitzing the service with the company’s back catalog all at once—like it did with <em>Fallout</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> after the Bethesda acquisition—Microsoft will be taking its time. However, there’s still no word yet on when <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2</em> will land on Game Pass. </p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/AQuietPlaceGame/status/1820810851340910636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, the team behind A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead revealed that its official release date is set for October 17, 2024.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive also revealed a brief new trailer to coincide with the release date announcement. The trailer features some brand-new footage captured on PC, including both cinematics and gameplay. </p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s new trailer also invites fans to pre-order A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead now, teasing pre-order bonuses. </p>

Last month, they added a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-receives-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tense story trailer</a> featuring 2 minutes of footage that breaks down the basic premise of the game.</p>



<p>Today, fans got a closer look at some more gameplay, teasing medical challenges, enemy encounters, and various obstacles.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s anticipated game is based on the hit series of horror films. Gaming fans can also look forward to an Until Dawn movie, which just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-cast-grows-peter-stormare-possibly-reprising-dr-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded its cast</a>, an animated show <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jb-smoove-high-on-life-animated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on High on Life</a>, and more.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It's been a long time coming, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fall-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-497671">Fall Guys</a> has finally arrived in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. The bean-based competition game begins its integration into the Fortnite ecosystem in several different ways--with Fortnite creative islands by Fall Guys developer Mediatonic, the ability for users to publish their own Fall Guys maps and, most importantly, an all-new Fall Guys-themed mini-game for battle royale and Zero Build.</p><p>Let's start with that. With this week's update, Fortnite battle royale will now host a Fall Guys mini-game that players can participate in by praising one of the statues of a Fall Guys bean person located around Classy Courts. Once you do, you'll be transformed into a bean person and made to play Fall Guys in an obstacle course in the sky. You'll have 120 seconds to complete it for loot--the faster you get it done, the better your loot will be. You can only complete it once per match, but you get three tries. And once the bean statues are in the storm you're locked out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4345767-fortnitefallguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345767" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4345767-fortnitefallguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345767"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at the Fall Guys obstacle course in Fortnite battle royale.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4345767-fortnitefallguys.jpg"></figure><p>This is similar to a feature from Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7, during which players could be abducted by aliens and made to play a competitive mini-game. But in this case, the choice to participate is entirely yours. Along with the mini-game will be a series of "Where We Fallin'" quests for rewards, including a bean person back bling.</p><p>What's particularly cool about this is that, as with Lego versions of skins, each of your Fortnite original skins will have a unique bean person design. Sadly, none of the current collaboration skins, like Marvel or Star Wars, is getting the bean guy treatment just yet, and so if you're wearing one of those then you'll appear as a generic, naked bean.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345912"></a><figcaption>This back bling will be a free quest reward during Fortnite's Where We Fallin' event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg"></figure><p>On top of the battle royale event, Fall Guys is getting six new Fortnite Creative islands from developer Mediatonic, and users can also now publish their own Fall Guys-themed islands as well.</p><p>This summer season has been unusually full of events in Fortnite, starting with Metallica and Reload in June, All Sweat Summer, Pirates of the Caribbean and Tesla in July, and now this Fall Guys stuff in August. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-start-date-leaks-and-rumors/2900-5569/" data-ref-id="2900-5569">Chapter 5 Season 4 is very close at hand</a>, starting on August 16.</p>

<p>"Although we're incredibly eager to share every fun detail of the game with you, 'Black Myth: Wukong' is a single-player game with an original storyline and unique gameplay," Game Science said on Twitter. "Therefore, we kindly ask that in these last few days before the official release, you avoid spreading any text, images, or videos that might reveal unreleased content, as well as any 'leak information' from unofficial sources."</p><p>Black Myth: Wukong launches on August 19 for PC and PlayStation 5. The game is also coming to Xbox Series X|S, but fans will have to wait a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-delayed-but-only-on-one-platform/1100-6524046/" data-ref-id="1100-6524046">bit longer as that version</a> currently doesn't meet the studio's standards and needs more time for optimization.</p><p>Game Science said that this is its first time launching a game internationally, so the team is looking into the logistics of how to provide physical copies to fans.</p>

However, it’s also reported that Reeves is only signed on in a production role, not an acting one.</p><p>Having tried to watch 2023's interminable <em>John Wick 4</em> twice now, the biggest news here for me is that it has an end. I love the first three films, albeit without having the faintest idea what was actually going on, but good lord, I wasn’t watching for the slow, plodding conversations. Still, end it must eventually have, because this TV show will continue the story after Wick’s meddling with the elite crew of crime bosses, the High Table, and a sort of reset on the whole assassin-organizing regime. And, well, if you’ve seen it, you’ll know the other major issue.</p><p>It’ll apparently feature the old guard attempting to reclaim the High Table for themselves, while a group of newbies attempt to step in and mould things to their own liking, which will provide the vital inner turmoil. However, what it won’t feature is John Wick.</p><p>This will be the second televised outing for the franchise not to feature its main character, the first being a three-episode limited series <em>The Continental: From the World of John Wick</em>, that aired on Peacock in 2023. However, that at least alluded to its tangential nature. “<em>John Wick: Under The High Table</em>” is clearly asking us to just accept the character’s name is also now some “Lego”-like franchise name, but it’s hard to imagine many will read it that way.</p><p>And this is just a fraction of forthcoming <em>John Wick</em>-related output. Currently a fifth main movie is in pre-production, while a Len Wiseman-fronted spin-off movie, <em>John Wick Presents: Ballerina</em> is due in June, 2025. There’s also yet another movie in the early stages, which will continue the events shown in <em>John Wick 4</em>'s post-credits scene, focusing on Donnie Yen’s character, Caine. Oh, and there are already plans for a <em>Ballerina</em> sequel. Good gravy.</p><p>For those who haven’t kept up, the first three <em>John Wick</em> movies are about a guy whose puppy gets killed prompting him to go on a 364-minute killing spree. Then the fourth film is about the man falling down a flight of stairs, sort of. Hopefully the new TV show will remember to keep talking to a minimum, and fighting to a maximum. There’s no word on a network yet, but it’s perhaps pertinent that Lionsgate owns Starz.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-more-coming-to-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/06/xbox-game-pass-august-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, Xbox Wire revealed the first wave of titles coming to Game Pass in August 2024, including the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and more.</p>



<p>There are only two other titles coming to Game Pass this month, including Creatures of Ava and Mafia: Definitive Edition. </p>



<p>Creatures of Ava will be available day one on Game Pass tomorrow, August 7, 2024. Mafia: Definitive Edition will join the Game Pass later on August 13, 2024. </p>



<p>Notably, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy arrives between them on August 8, 2024, confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-on-august-8-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous leaks</a> from late last month. This may add a lot of validity to leaker eXtas1s and their future claims.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Although three titles is quite small for a wave of Game Pass titles, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is sure to please as a bundle. It offers Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. </p>



<p>These all remain fan favorite games, just like Mafia: Definitive Edition. Although, 2K Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-definitive-edition-comes-to-xbox-game-pass-august-13th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> when Mafia: Definitive Edition was coming to Game Pass in July, so it isn’t much of a surprise.</p>



<p>Creatures of Ava is a day one release, which always adds some value to the subscription, and it’s an indie highlight. The game is a creature collector from developer Inverge Studios.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-publishers-cataclismo-racks-up-120k-sales-in-two-weeks.945717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-sales-120k-two-weeks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, the base-building strategy game developed by Digital Sun, has hit a pretty impressive sales milestone just two weeks after its initial release.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/HoodedHorseInc/status/1820552533557014698" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Hooded Horse's X (formerly Twitter) account</a>,&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has managed to amass 120,000 sales within its first two weeks of launch, which isn't bad for an Early Access strategy-based city-builder. Looks like that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-delayed-early-access">delay and Early Access adoption</a> served Digital Sun well.</p>
<p>In the post, Hooded Horse also announces that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has racked up a 93% positive review score on Steam, so it looks like players are taking to its mixture of base-building and tower defense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cataclismo-sales-120k-hordes.jpg?itok=gBJ87Z8X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cataclismo-sales-120k-hordes.jpg?itok=mzj9L3WF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has captured strategy fans' imaginations, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher says it's "honored" to work with Digital Sun on&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, and that Hooded Horse "love[s] building and defending castles". I should hope so, given that's&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>'s bread and butter.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/DigitalSunGames/status/1820746886619230696" rel="noopener" target="_blank">own X post</a>, Digital Sun says that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is its fastest game to surpass 100,000 sales, as well as its highest-rated game on Steam.</p>
<p>It's true; a quick look confirms that shop management sim-come-roguelite&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moonlighter</a>&nbsp;</em>has an 82% approval rating, while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457080/The_Mageseeker_A_League_of_Legends_Story/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story</a>&nbsp;</em>sits at 84%. Those aren't bad scores by any means, but they do make&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>'s success even more impressive.</p>
<p>Admittedly,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>has far more reviews under its belt, but&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is comparable to&nbsp;<em>The Mageseeker&nbsp;</em>in terms of review numbers, so the increased score is perhaps a bit more telling there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digital-sun-cataclismo-sales-the-mageseeker.jpg?itok=qVduXvB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digital-sun-cataclismo-sales-the-mageseeker.jpg?itok=_Ump3hoy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Mageseeker&nbsp;</em>is Digital Sun's next best-reviewed game on Steam after&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, it's a strategy game in which you must design a base and then defend it against hordes of slavering monsters.</p>
<p>You'll have access to a wide range of pieces from which to build your bases, and when it comes time to defend them, you'll be able to command soldiers with specialist skills and abilities to help you.</p>
<p><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422440/Cataclismo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Digital Sun says it's aiming to keep the game in Early Access for "around a year", but that this timeframe could change depending on "player feedback".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Bean-based battle royale <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> now exists within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with fresh courses built by developer Mediatonic.
</p>
<p>
The addition of Fall Guys as a permanent part of the Fortniteverse comes after Epic Games acquired Mediatonic back in 2021, and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-developer-hit-hard-by-epic-games-layoffs-but-studio-to-remain-open">extensive layoffs at the British firm last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
For a limited time, you can play Fall Guys within Fortnite's battle royale, via an enormous obstacle course currently floating above the map. Enter into it and your in-game character will be turned into a customised Fall Guy bean. There's also a smattering of limited-time rewards. 
</p>
<p>
Outside of Fortnite's battle royale, you can play custom Fall Guys levels made by Mediatonic and additional mini-games made by other creators, who have had access to Fall Guys assets ahead of time.

</p></div>
<p>
The tie-up appears permanent, with a dedicated Fall Guys row in Fortnite's main Discover menu, and all non-licensed Fortnite skins given a Fall Guys bean character equivalent.
</p>
<p>
"If we started Fall Guys development over today, we'd do it inside Fortnite," Epic Games executive vice president Saxs Persson told Eurogamer earlier this year, when asked if Fall Guys development would ever solely exist within Fortnite. "But we are where we are, we don't have anything to announce right now.
</p>
<p>
"You learn different things when you're separate, but we truly believe the magic of Fortnite is having fun in a game with your friends so the more players there are, the more content there is, the more fun you have. So by that simple measure, it benefits us to have everything in one place."

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-goes-gold-set-to-release-as-scheduled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-goes-gold-set-to-release-%E2%80%98as-scheduled%E2%80%99.945696/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-goes-gold-set-to-release-as-scheduled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1820649285450649680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, developer Game Science announced that Black Myth: Wukong has officially gone gold, meaning its development is now complete.</p>



<p>The team added that the game “will be released as scheduled,” and they are actively working on ” the final stages of experiencing, testing, and deploying the game.”</p>



<p>Further, Game Science revealed that a new trailer is coming on August 8, 2024. The anticipated trailer will premiere at 10 AM Beijing time, or 10 PM eastern time. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Destined Ones,<br>Thank you for your patience! We're thrilled to announce that the full development of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackMythWukong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackMythWukong</a>  is complete, and the game will be released as scheduled.😉<br>Right now, our entire team is working hard on the final stages of experiencing, testing, and… <a href="https://t.co/KOpj6F6xtJ">pic.twitter.com/KOpj6F6xtJ</a></p>— Black Myth: Wukong (@BlackMythGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMythGame/status/1820649285450649680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Black Myth: Wukong pre-orders are available now on PlayStation 5, Steam, the Epic Games Store, and WeGame. However, although Black Myth: Wukong went gold, its Xbox version still doesn’t have a concrete release date.</p>



<p>Game Science first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the Xbox delay</a> in June 2024. According to the <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order FAQ page</a>, the developers are still “optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards.” </p>



<p>As a result, the Xbox version will not be available at launch with the other platforms. </p>



<p>Game Science said that “we apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users.” The devs carefully say they will “announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p>



<p>Microsoft later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-issues-statement-on-black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered a vague statement</a> only hinting at the potential cause for Black Myth: Wukong’s delay on Xbox.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong will release on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20, 2024.</p>

                <p>Two iconic and popular modern video game horror franchises are finally crossing over: Dead by Daylight and Five Nights at Freddy's.

            <p>

I don't play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/10/pentagon-first-person-shooter-video-games-military-recruitment-propaganda">Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating</a> to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>'s new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

As the cumbersome moniker suggests, omnimovement is all about 360 degree responsiveness. It lets you sprint, dive and slide in any direction at the drop of a bullet casing, and lets you rotate freely while prone in the bargain. It sits alongside some new assists - you can set your character to mantle and sprint automatically, and there's a new "corner-slicing" gimmick that sees you peeking around surfaces automatically while aiming. 
</p>
<p>
The idea, Activision claim, is to make the game both look and feel more "fluid" rather than simply upping the tempo. "It was never a goal with Omnimovement to just make things fast," associate design director Matt Scronce <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-omnimovement/">told Comicbook.com</a> in June. "This isn't the fastest Call of Duty game. Our average speeds - because you can sprint in any direction, and on average, you're probably sprinting a little bit more - are a little bit higher. But it was never about making things fast." Perhaps not, but it looks like it's going to give some players the edge at close quarters. Possibilities include diving through windows and rotating as you land to headshot the poor sucker who thought they were ambushing you.
</p>
<p>
A development build of Black Ops 6 leaked this week, and verdicts and footage are flooding in from unscrupulous sorts who've gotten hold of the goods. I won't post any of that filth here, for Activision's lawyers are ever-watchful, but I'll briefly paraphrase the reactions I've read, which run the expected gamut. Some are calling it the second coming of the exosuits introduced by Advanced Warfare. Some compare it favourably to Quake. Some compare it unfavourably to Quake. 
</p>
<p>
There are the usual concerns that the new movement suite will empower or disempower community favourite playstyles or techniques: omnimovement appears to have wrought the ignoble end of slide-cancelling, for example, though this may just be a limitation of the dev build. There are suggestions that omnimovement will create a new skill gap - omnimovement certainly seems built for showboating pros and their streaming audiences. Pretty much everybody I've read agrees it'll take time to bed in, perhaps more time than is usual for a new COD quirk. I'm curious to know what the duty-callers of the RPS commentariat make of such things. We'll have more to say at the end of the month, if not before - the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-early-access-and-open-beta-dates-revealed">Black Ops 6 beta</a> begins on Friday August 30th for selected players.

The gameplay remains available and heavily discussed on a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1ejdt0c/new_potential_warzone_map_leaked_as_part_of_major/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JenNettles</a>, however, where many fans are expressing concern at its design.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The backlash comes because the map is largely made up of water, as a sliver of mainland quickly falls away to a series of small islands scattered throughout. "Nothing but open fields and water. No thanks," said Electricengineer. "Caldera, but with water," said SideOfFish. "Have they ever received positive feedback about the inclusion of water?" asked DefunctHunk. "Why are they insisting on shoving it in wherever possible?"</p><p>Avalon is not confirmed to be the next Warzone map, of course, but it's unlikely Activision would have the entire thing built with no plans to use it.

This takes place on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC from August 30 to September 4, while an open beta takes place September 6 to September 9. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-and-more-leaked-via-xboxs-own-website">The game launches proper on October 25, 2024</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

		<p>Everyone loves a good giveaway, and so to celebrate the release of Cat Quest 3 on 8th August (which just so happens to be International Cat Day) we’ve partnered with The Gentlebros and publisher Kepler Interactive to giveaway three EU region codes for the game on PS4 and PS5!</p>
<p><iframe title="Cat Quest III - How To Be A Pirate" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivqrZCbwZUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cat-quest-iii">Cat Quest 3</a> follows in the paw prints of the first two games, as another light action RPG that’s stuffed with cat-based puns. However, where those first two games were a feline twist on medieval fantasy, Cat Quest 3 plunders the high seas of the Purribean for piratical action. You’ll now be able to hop into a boat and blast away at Pi-rat enemies, while still indulging in all the familiar hack and slash action without getting your fur wet on land. Oh, and just as with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/30/cat-quest-ii-review/">Cat Quest 2</a>, there’s full local co-op support for two players!</p>
<p>We’ve just published our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/cat-quest-3-review/">Cat Quest 3 review</a>, and had a great time rampaging across the seas and putting the Pi-rat King in his place! I said, “With its piratical new setting and boatylicious battling, Cat Quest 3 is another fun and light sequel in probably the cutest action RPG series out there.”</p>
<p>If all of that sounds purrfectly delightful, then enter our giveaway here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gleam.io/Y5Iqc/win-one-of-three-copies-of-cat-quest-3-for-playstation" rel="nofollow">Win one of three copies of Cat Quest 3 for PlayStation</a><br>
</p>

<p>Please note: as these are EU region digital codes, this is only open to UK and EU residents with a European PSN account – sorry, America-land. Winners will be selected at random, with each winner scoring one of the three digital codes for Cat Quest 3 on PlayStation. The competition <strong>closes at 18:00 BST on Thursday 8th August 2024</strong>. Winners will be contacted by email. Our standard terms and conditions apply.</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 will be launching across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on 8th August.</p>

            <p>You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.</p>

<p>Kimothy challenges you to a fight for your soda, and the fun begins. In terms of input, the rhythm combat is simple. Quick presses and lengthy hold attacks come at you via the traditional musical conveyer belt, and you fend them off one key press at a time. Conceptually not too tricky, but actually quite busy. Kimothy bobs up and down clutching his stick and talking about special moves. I do not think the game is going to let me shove that stick up his nose later, but what are we without hope?</p>
<p>Next up, you find a giant mantis. The game tells me I can sneak past, but I am a slave to the rhythm, so I charge right in. He messes me up pretty bad, but I do pull through, and then it’s off to find more things to rhythm at.</p>
<p>“Master an entirely skill based rhythm combat with fierce battles and unexpected challenges,” reads the Steam page, which also offers a demo. Ah, skill based. There’s my problem. “With multiple difficulty options, Nocturne is a game suitable for beginners and veterans of the rhythm genre.” One of the features is “Befriend a giant orange fish”, and I also like the idea of unlocking each defeated enemy in an optional arcade mode for high score. The game got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/883590/Nocturne_Prelude/">prelude chapter</a> in 2020, and seems to have come a long way since. It’s due out sometime next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fluid-motion-frames-2-ai-optimization-performance-enhancements-low-latency-frame-gen/">AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2</a> is a decisive step forward over the previous version of the technology, so much so that the tech experts at Digital Foundry found it to be "stupidly good."</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts offered a first look at the new version of AMD's driver-level frame generation, highlighting how in the tested games - Control, Cyberpunk 2077 and Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 - AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2 typically delivered double the base framerate with much better quality than the first version, which turned off in sequences with really fast motion due to the low quality of the interpolated fast frames. As such, the technology can now deliver a high refresh rate experience with acceptable visual quality even on upper mid-range graphics cards like the RX 7900 GRE.</p>
<p>Despite the improvements brought by AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2, some issues still persist, such as visual quality issues for HUD elements, like the aiming reticle in Control. Even so, the technology shows great potential, as it can deliver a great experience in both fast-paced games and slower-paced titles, even with a low base frame rate. In general, quality is better than Lossless Scaling, the application that offers frame generation on any GPU which is set to offer a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-4x-fps/">4x FPS option</a> in the future, and while it cannot hold up to NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation for obvious reasons, AMD FMF2 is still great to have for games that are never going to get frame generation in any form, or emulated games.</p>

            <p>
Fans of Konami's original Silent Hill 2 have been sceptical of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s forthcoming remake, but its CEO Piotr Babieno has called for fans to trust the studio.
</p>
<p>
Bloober is known for developing psychological horror games, but despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-is-excited-and-very-confident">its confidence in the remake</a> fans have been less forgiving in their criticism of trailers shown so far.

</p>
<p>
"I am dreaming that gamers will trust us," Babieno told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/bloober-teams-piotr-babieno-talks-silent-hill-2-criticisms-1235061338/">Rolling Stone</a>, "but I realise that trust is earned through actions, not through words. So that's why we have a policy of not commenting [on the specifics of the game] and raising hopes. We want to show our ambitions through our work, so we can't ask for anything more than 'give us a chance.'"

<p>
Babieno is sympathetic to the importance of the game to fans of the series. He too is a fan, stating playing the game "changed [his] life".
</p>
<p>
"Despite technological progress [in video games]," he said, "so many of us remember [visiting] the town of Silent Hill as one of the most important points in our lives."
</p>
<p>The original game released on the PS2 back in 2001 and has proven iconic for its Pyramid Head and nurse enemies.</p>
<p>
Thanks to conversations between Bloober and Konami, "we found a great balance of what we and our partner had in mind," said Babieno. "It took us a long time to get there, with a lot of creative discussions and hard work, but we are very happy with the result."
</p>
<p>
Constructive criticism from fans has been taken into account, which so far has been "invaluable in refining our project before its release", though the studio's developers also focus "on their creative work with peace of mind" by shutting out other voices.
</p>
<p>
"We tried to make all possible fans happy, but, at the same time, be very faithful to ourselves," said Babieno. "I really hope that when people play for the first time, they will understand that the choices we made were the best possible."
</p>
<p>
Further, work on Silent Hill 2 is ushering in a new era for the studio as it moves towards delivering horror through action and not just the psychological horror and environmental storytelling it's become known for.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill 2 will therefore function as "a culmination of my work, but, at the same time, a gateway to the new," said Babieno.
</p>
<p>
The remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2 is set for release</a> on PS5 and PC in October, as revealed at Sony's State of Play in May with a new trailer (see above).
