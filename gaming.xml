			<p>An unofficial PC port of Sonic Unleashed is now available for download, allowing PC users to experience the PS3/Xbox 360 era entry in the series natively with some visual improvements and additional features not available in the original releases.</p>
<p>The Unleashed Recompiled port, which can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and requires a copy of the Xbox 360 version of the game, has been created through the process of static recompilation and features no original assets whatsoever, which should make it safe from any takedown from SEGA. While the visuals have been recreated from scratch, the development team took extra care to make them as accurate as possible while also improving them where needed with up to 4K resolution support, MSAA levels over double, enhanced motion blur, and more. In addition, the port also supports unlocked framerates, although any framerate above 60 FPS could lead to issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unleashed Recompiled - Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJreGbVPDx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Unleashed is one of the very few entries in the series worth playing that are not officially available on PC, so the release of this unofficial port is quite welcome. The game's most defining feature, which was not implemented in any subsequent entry in the series, is the Werehog gameplay segments, which featured slower gameplay compared to the day stages that sported modern Sonic gameplay and focused on combat sequences.</p>
<p>The latest 3D entry in the series is<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/"> Sonic Frontiers</a>, which was released in 2022 on PC and consoles. The game was followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadows Generations remaster</a>, which introduced new solid content to what was already a pretty solid Sonic game and one of the best in recent times.</p>

            <p>A mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been created that allows for unlimited character and palico edits, essentially bypassing Capcom's monetisation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">As we reported last week</a>, editing your character after the initial setup requires special vouchers that can be bought for £5.79, although Capcom does provide a voucher to change your characters once for free.</p>
<p>It's an egregious inclusion that nonetheless has been part of the games since Monster Hunter World. But thanks to modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/133?tab=description">Ridog8</a>, PC players can have unlimited character edits.</p>

<p>The mod still uses edit vouchers, but they're set to zero and will continue to work. Surely Capcom will find a way to patch this out?</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds only released a few days ago, but already there are plenty of mods available for PC players looking to improve the experience.</p>
<p>For instance, Monster Hunter Wilds includes an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-turn-on-arachnophobia-setting-monster-hunter-wilds">arachnophobia mode</a> in its accessibility settings, but frustratingly that only applies to the smaller eight-legged creatures that crawl around the wilds and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-arachnophobia-mode-turns-eight-legged-critters-into-amusing-blobs">turns them into blobs of goo instead</a>.</p>
<p>But there are larger monsters to hunt that are especially spider-like: the Lala Barina, for instance, with its spindly legs and scarlet webbing; or the Nerscylla that swings like Spider-Man over each battle arena.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/143?tab=description">Tea Common Shark</a> has created a mod that extends the arachnophobia mode to these larger monsters - they're not quite giant blobs, but at least their spider-like features are mostly disguised.</p>
<p>"I did this mainly because it's funny," the modder joked, "but it might also help those who can't bear to look at them."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Spider becomes Mr Blobby | <span>Image credit: <cite>Tea Common Shark</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other mods look to improve on some of the key criticisms of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/136">Furiante</a> has created a harder difficult mod that increases monster HP and damage, with multiple values available so hunters can customise the experience to their liking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/16?tab=description">GreenComfyTea</a> has created a mod that adds health bars to monsters, though I'd argue half the fun is not knowing the numbers and watching for that telltale limp instead.</p>
<p>Another complaint are the drab, somewhat washed out visuals of the game, but beyond playing with the game's brightness and saturation options, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/168">SchiggyCGN</a> has created a reshade that makes the game considerably more vibrant. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/94">Other modders</a> have done <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/97">similar work</a>.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>SchiggyCGN's vibrant mod. | <span>Image credit: <cite>SchiggyCGN</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps most ambitiously, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/88">Velasquez</a> has created a mod with new graphic presets in a bid to optimise the game's performance. Considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor performance of Monster Hunter Wilds on PC</a>, it's great to see modders getting to grips with optimisation before Capcom does.</p>

            <p>
Steam hit another new player record this weekend, with more than 40 million people online at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
Last Friday was, of course, the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> - which soared to a peak of more than 1.38 million concurrent players on Saturday night. That same total was then repeated on Sunday, when a peak of 1.37 million concurrent players jumped back into the game.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Monster Hunter Wilds is the second-most played game on Steam, behind evergreen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, but ahead of other stalwarts such as PUBG and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds has clearly been a huge hit</a>, with a Steam play count three times higher than any previous Monster Hunter game, let alone anything else publisher Capcom has ever launched, Resident Evil included.
</p>
<p>
It's not all been plain sailing for the game, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">User reviews for Monster Hunter Wilds remain "Mixed" on Steam</a>, with only 53 percent of players currently saying they'd recommend the game, and a fair amount of criticism for its technical performance on PC right now.

<p>
Digital Foundry echoed that on Friday, going as far as saying the team "can't recommend the PC version" as "substantial technical problems must be addressed".
</p>
<p>
"To sum up, lower-end graphics cards with lower VRAM allocations should avoid Monster Hunter Wilds until these issues are rectified," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia wrote</a>. "Higher-end hardware can brute-force the game's shortcomings to some degree, but it's still hard to recommend such a flawed technical outing - or even derive optimised settings."
</p>
<p>
Other criticism has surfaced for the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">need to pay if you want to keep changing your Monster Hunter Wilds character</a> - though you do get one edit for free.

            <p>Can you feel it? Spring is in the air. The mornings are brighter, birds are singing and flowers are starting to break free from their wintery soil confines. And, to kick off the upcoming season, Xbox has more Game Pass news to share.</p>
<p>While we still don't have the first full batch of March monthly newcomers (although we can expect that very soon, so stay tuned), the Xbox team has revealed eight games leaving its Game Pass subscription service within the next two weeks, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-5-review">Yakuza 5</a> Remastered.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last month, a little game you may have heard of - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-balatro-has-shadow-dropped-on-game-pass">Balatro - became available via Xbox Game Pass</a>. We here at Eurogamer are rather fond of Balatro, naming it one of our favourite games of 2024. "It's a work of marvellous depth and winning simplicity, and rightly one of the best and most memorable games you'll play this year," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's round up of the 50 best games of 2024</a>.</p>

<p>"It's not a Zachtronics game," Barth told PC Gamer in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/one-of-the-best-puzzle-game-designers-is-back-with-kaizen-a-factory-story-a-game-about-manufacturing-japanese-consumer-goods-during-the-largest-economic-bubble-in-history/">an interview</a> following the game's announcment. "This is a Coincidence game, which is a totally legally distinct game studio."</p>
<p>Coincidence have already released one game - Add Astra, an educational puzzler about math and racing. But this looks like a more intentional successor to the automation crown. All the hallmarks of the designers' previous programmy puzzlers seem to be intact. You play as a fish out of water (in this case a Japanese-American who finds himself working in a factory on the outskirts of Tokyo), you'll tinker with machinery to come up with efficient (or comically inefficient) solutions, and you'll export GIFs of your assembly lines with all the pride of an Instagram mum showing off little Gregory's latest crayon spew. It has solitaire, but the solitaire is also pachinko. It's called "Pachi-Sol".</p>

<p>It does have one new interesting feature, though. You'll be able to scrub back through your building process in a rewind-ish way, and edit it from whatever specific point you royally messed up. Which sounds like it'll be handy on bigger projects. </p>
<p>Many writers at RPS have been fans of these games over the years. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/premature-evaluation-shenzhen-io">swooned</a> over Shenzhen I/O, which saw you emigrating to China to make circuit boards. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eliza-review">lost sleep</a> (in a good way) while playing thoughtful visual novel Eliza. And when alchemy dabbler Opus Magnum released it left Matt, Graham and myself competing to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-machina-our-proudest-opus-magnum-machines">magnificent machinery</a> (sadly, the powerful GIFs in this article no longer work). "I really like making my dumb little games that don't matter," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/opus-magnum-interview-zach-barth">said Zach Barth</a> following that game's release. Games that <em>don't matter?</em> Excuse me, Opus Magnum remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle games</a> to this day. </p>
<p>A few years later Zachtronics would close, but not before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/retro-styled-puzzle-compilation-last-call-bbs-is-the-final-zachtronics-game">releasing its final game</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-call-bbs">Last Call BBS</a>. It looks like that swan song was actually just a big white duck quacking musically, now that Barth and Burns have returned with Coincidence.</p>
<p>We've been in the habit of calling these puzzle games "Zachlikes" ever since Alice O'Connor (RPS in peace) coined the term, although Barth, after whom the genre is named, wishes it were different. "I hate saying Zach-like," he told PC Gamer. "If anybody has any suggestions for a different thing we can call them?" Hmmm... I don't know. On the one hand, you did release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zachtronics-book-on-game-design-crowdfunding-on-kickstarter">a whole book with Zach-like as the title</a>, somewhat sealing the term with approval. Then again, it's true we often caution against auteurism in the RPS treehouse. What to do, what to do. </p>
<p>Let's put these thoughts off until Kaizen: A Factory Story comes out. A release date hasn't been announced yet. I'll set up some elaborate electrical alarms to go off when we know more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Relic: First Guardian, an upcoming Soulslike action RPG, received a new gameplay trailer on Friday. Developed by South Korean studio Project Cloud Games and published by Perp Games, the title is due to launch later this year on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827820/The_Relic_First_Guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, on PlayStation 5, and on Xbox Series S|X. It was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-soulslike-galore-at-gamescom-2021-with-project-relic-soulstice-and-dolmen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> as Project Relic at Gamescom 2021. However, back then, it was unveiled as a multiplayer title. It appears that has since changed, as it's now listed as a single player game.</p>
<p>Players will embark on a heroic adventure as the last Guardian to save the world from darkness. The once-prosperous Arsiltus has been swallowed up by the void created by the destruction of the great relic and turned into a land of death. The hero's goal is to gather the pieces of the shattered Great Relic and close the Void.</p>
<p>The developers have described The Relic: First Guardian as a semi-open world action RPG where players will explore an apocalyptic fantasy world and enjoy a variety of action-packed experiences. They'll get to pick between five different types of weapon options, and each weapon has its own unique abilities that can be changed to suit their play style.</p>

<p>There won't be a traditional roleplaying game inspired leveling system. The developers have instead based the game's character progression entirely on runes, items, and crafting. These rewards will be obtained by completing dungeons and defeating bosses.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-40-million-users-xbox-outpacing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-hits-40-million-peak-users-and-effortlessly-outpaces-xbox-in-one-major-way.1123449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-40-million-users-xbox-outpacing/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hours ago, Steam hit a new milestone – <strong>40 million peak concurrent users </strong>online on the platform. This monumental figure was secured with 12 million players worldwide being <strong>in a game </strong>as the total number crept over the 40 million mark.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, the most recent estimates suggest that Microsoft has sold around 30 million Xbox Series consoles since they debuted in 2020. That means that even if every person who ever bought an Xbox Series X or Series S were to log on simultaneously, they’d still need <strong>10 million people </strong>to hit Steam’s peak player count.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-stuff">Impressive Stuff</h2>



<p>Steam is a powerhouse of a platform, and PC gaming is exploding. Recently, it was revealed in a data-driven report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-outperforming-consoles/">PC gaming has been outpacing</a> ‘living room console’ revenue since 2011. Collectively, the PC gaming market has earned 225% more than ‘combined console’ spend in the last decade or so.</p>



<p>If you think about it for a moment, it becomes pretty incredible.</p>



<p>At one point in the last few hours, <strong>40 million people </strong>were online on Steam all at the same time. That’s more than the population of Canada, and it almost beats the population of Greece, Portugal, Hungary, and Switzerland <strong>combined</strong>.</p>



<p>It was recently estimated that Microsoft has managed to shift around 30 million Xbox Series consoles since 2020, pacing far behind Sony with more than 70 million PlayStation 5 sales. That means that more people are using Steam right now than have purchased Xbox consoles in a five-year window.</p>



<p>It’s apples and oranges as Steam has built up that repository of users over a <strong>very long period</strong>, but it’s certainly indicative of the wider power of PC gaming. It has even been estimated that Xbox Game Pass has around 34 million subscribers, so Steam trumps that as well.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 40 million? Let us know what you use Steam for in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/john-cena-gta-6-post-instagram/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-cena%E2%80%99s-gta-6-post-has-fans-speculating-like-crazy.1123446/</guid>

<p>Recently, John Cena blew minds across the WWE universe after turning against Cody Rhodes at the Elimination Chamber PPV. This major heel turn comes as his retirement tour unfolds, and while many predicted it, it’s still surprising.</p>



<p>Following the win at Elimination Chamber, the 47-year-old superstar took to social media to post a promotional image of Grand Theft Auto 6 with no caption or context. This has fuelled speculation online, with fans of both the franchise and the iconic athlete believing that John Cena could be in GTA 6.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-highly-unlikely">Highly Unlikely</h2>



<p>Nobody understands why John Cena would post a promotional image for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johncena/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on his Instagram page</a>, but he did it, and that’s all we know.</p>



<p>To be fair, his bio suggests we should anticipate posts like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These images will be posted without explanation, for your interpretation. Enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s up to us to decide what the post means, then.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many have surmised that it’s Cena’s take on the ‘before GTA 6’ meme that has run rampant on social media in the past few months.</p>



<p>‘We got a John Cena heel turn before GTA 6’, kind of thing.</p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for celebrities to appear in a Grand Theft Auto game, but it <strong>is </strong>unlikely that Rockstar Games or Take-Two would have ‘allowed’ Cena to make the post if he were involved with the game. That’s just too much of a spoiler.</p>



<p>Cena has more time on his hands now, so perhaps he has lent his voice and acting talents to the next iteration of the Grand Theft Auto series. Who knows? He appeared in PGA Tour 2K23, and Take-Two was the publisher for WWE games for many years, so he has a connection to Take-Two in some way.</p>



<p>What role could you see John Cena taking up in GTA 6? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-minor-ii-la-thieves-win/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/la-thieves-beat-a-dominant-surge-to-win-cdl-minor-ii.1123443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-minor-ii-la-thieves-win/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The LA Thieves have secured their first sizeable win in the 2025 Call of Duty League season, beating Vancouver Surge in the grand final of Minor II. The series came down to the wire, with Vancouver riding high on a string of wins that exemplified how dominant the amended roster has been recently.</p>



<p>Vancouver Surge was able to overcome Boston, FaZe, and Toronto before putting up one hell of a fight against the LA Thieves in the grand final. Ultimately, it was LAT that walked away with the $20,000 prize and the 30 CDL points that pushed the squad into second place in the season standings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minor-win-major-gains">Minor Win, Major Gains</h2>



<p>The CDL Minor structure is a brand-new concept for the 2025 season. It’s designed to split up the qualifying stages and give players a cash prize to work towards, and it’s a ‘winner takes all’ event. Each stage will have a Minor and a Major, and the first one, which took place before Major I in Madrid, was claimed by Atlanta FaZe.</p>



<p>This time around, it was the LA Thieves that shone, with the team having earned a bye thanks to their seeding in the regular season. The squad picked apart Cloud9 and the Royal Ravens to unlock the grand final, at which point they stomped Vancouver Surge to claim the number one spot.</p>



<p>It was a clockwork tournament for the LA Thieves, but other teams didn’t fare so well.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe struggled to hit the mark and collapsed against Vancouver Surge, taking it to a game five and falling short in the final SnD. OpTic Texas clashed with Falcons and secured a win but lost with a 0 – 3 scoreline against Toronto Ultra.</p>



<p>The fixture against the Vegas Falcons saw history <strong>almost </strong>being made. The Falcons put up a solid fight in the opening Hardpoint and managed to secure a 3 – 0 win in Control. The first round of Search also went down to the wire, with round eleven being needed for OpTic Texas to win the game.</p>



<p>That could have been a <strong>very </strong>different story.</p>



<p>We now look to Major II, which will take place from March 20 – 23 in Texas. The power players could be starting to shift, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/">OpTic Texas will be in trouble</a> if it doesn’t sharpen up ahead of the home Major.</p>

<p>Whilst the NSPCC acknowledges the risks that come with online gaming, the NSPCC also hears from many young people on the benefits of playing games, both online and offline, with one 14-year-old saying: "Sometimes I get overwhelmed with everything going on around me.</p>
<p>"My new support worker knows I love board games, and he showed me I can play Cluedo online! It’s part of my strategy now when I need a distraction, it feels really good to have plans to help me cope."</p>
<p>"The NSPCC is excited to announce the launch of the Game Safe Steam sale. The proceeds will help us to support children and young people through services, such as Childline," said Lewie Procter, head of gaming partnerships at the NSPCC.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled that popular games, such as Cluedo, Hypnospace Outlaw and Yes, Your Grace, are on sale, giving gaming fans a chance to make a difference.</p>
<p>"We want to thank Steam for partnering with us and to the developers and publishers for supporting this brilliant initiative. We are proud to work with them and look forward to continuing to raise awareness of online safety on gaming platforms."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-breaks-40-million-online-users-milestone/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-breaks-40-million-online-users-milestone.1123272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steam-breaks-40-million-online-users-milestone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Valve's Steam platform continues to grow, <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching</a> a historic milestone today at 14:00 UTC: 40.2 million online users, 12.7 million of which were playing a game. The biggest PC gaming platform has registered steady growth over the past year; let's recap the previous records below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 8, 2024 – 39.2 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 23, 2024 - 38.3 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-37-2-million-concurrent-players-breaking-all-previous-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 26, 2024 - 37.2 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-another-record-with-36-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 15, 2024 - 36.3 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-record-with-over-34-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mar 2, 2024 - 34.2 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-top-concurrent-player-number-record-nearing-34-million-connected-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 7, 2024 - 33.6 million online users</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The growth trend is crystal clear for everyone to see, showing that Epic's efforts with their own PC store did not in any way impact Valve's Steam. That said, the Epic Games Store is also growing. Just a couple of weeks ago, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the updated figures, such as over 295 million accounts (+25 million compared to last year), 67 million monthly users on average in 2024 (+6%) and 32 million daily users on average (also +6%), and 7.72 billion gameplay hours spent in 2024.</p>
<p>It's obvious that PC gaming is as healthy as it's ever been, which is great news for gamers. Wider audiences inevitably lead to better-performing games from a commercial standpoint. For example, Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> 1.38 million concurrent users on Steam alone, no doubt making Japanese developer and publisher CAPCOM very happy so far with their latest game release.</p>

<p>As well as the base game, in which players "punch, stab, slice, and maul enemies as Cherry, a take-no-prisoners fembot trying to survive a twisted planet on the brink of destruction", the Switch Overkill Edition boasts three updates and upgrades, including fully voiced dialogue for every character, new map features, and brand-new special moves and upgrades for Cherry.</p>

<p>Other new features include new cinematics to "add more style and background to the story", "tons" of gameplay tweaks and progression balancing, and a handful of special Nintendo Switch-flavoured easter eggs, too.</p>
<p>There's also now a new feature that helps you "gauge completion status".</p>
<p>"Love turns to rage and chainsaws in Cookie Cutter, a bold new take on the Metroidvania sub-genre," teases the blurb. "Cookie Cutter features gorgeous hand-drawn animation, an enormous dystopian world to explore, epic boss fights, gruesome carnage, and so much more."</p>
<p>As yet there's no firm release date, but publisher Rogue Games hints it'll be "this spring"/Q2. Players on PC via Steam, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X/S don't have to wait, of course - Cherry's already waiting for you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 developer and publisher Saber and Focus has acknowledged fans' "cold" response to recent changes, stressing to players they were "not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game".</p>
<p>After introducing a new way for players to unlock cosmetic items, the team acknowledged player "FOMO" but assured the community that the items would be available "for everyone" "later", expecting only "the most dedicated players" able to unlock items early.</p>

<p>"We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items," the teams at Saber and Focus wrote in a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update">joint update</a>.</p>
<p>"We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone.</p>
<p>"However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far," the statement added. "We deeply apologise for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the update, Focus confirmed there's still "a bit of a wait" for Patch 7, but 6.0 Datavault Update released earlier this month ushers in new free and season pass content, as well as new packs, maps, perks, and QoL improvements.</p>

Now it seems Mewtwo ex’s meta-dominating days will come to an end, as another card has quickly overtaken its throne. - Timothy Monbleau <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dafd0fa73225b631bd5ae41589728294" data-recommend-id="image://dafd0fa73225b631bd5ae41589728294" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Some gorgeous art from a memory in Avowed, where swirling purple lights suggest a face in front of an elfin character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some gorgeous art from a memory in Avowed, where swirling purple lights suggest a face in front of an elfin character." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dafd0fa73225b631bd5ae41589728294" data-recommend-id="image://dafd0fa73225b631bd5ae41589728294" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Some gorgeous art from a memory in Avowed, where swirling purple lights suggest a face in front of an elfin character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the earliest quests you’ll receive in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cdkeys.pxf.io/c/379647/1566025/18216?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Favowed-standard-edition-xbox-series-x-s-pc-ww&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cdkeys.pxf.io/c/379647/1566025/18216?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Favowed-standard-edition-xbox-series-x-s-pc-ww" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avowed</em></a></span> is “Message From Afar,” which sends you to the northwestern corner of Dawnshore to explore the Strangleroot.

<p>As yet, there's no confirmation on when this may be addressed, but Capcom has been whack-a-mole-ing issues fairly swiftly over the weekend. For instance, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896084293438648676">a hot fix patch resolving issues with the Smithy and "Grill a Meal"</a> is already live, so make sure you apply any patches before you play to ensure you're using the latest version.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">smashed the 1m concurrent players barrier on Steam</a> and if you're one of the many players who likes to jump back into the character editor because you've given your hunter a beer gut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">you might appreciate knowing you can modify your character once for free</a>, but any further substantive changes to your gender or body shape requires before Capcom makes you cough up some cash.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt awarded it 4/5, saying: "Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades.</p>
<p>"And if it continues Monster Hunter's legacy of generous post-launch support - where the series has traditionally felt the freest to get daft and indulge in its more sadistic tendencies - it'll be fascinating to see how this beautiful new baseline for the series develops."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is off to an amazing start, at least in terms of Steam numbers. CAPCOM's latest entry in the monster hunting franchise has literally crushed the player concurrency peaks registered by the two previous (and already highly successful) entries, Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, which stopped at 334K and 231K concurrent users, respectively.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has just <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 1.38 million concurrent users, over a million more than Monster Hunter World, which is enough to place it in Steam's all-time Top 5, behind only PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Black Myth: Wukong, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2, and just ahead of the free-to-play action RPG Lost Ark. A new concurrency peak may well be registered later today, although it's unlikely it'd be enough to surpass Counter-Strike 2's record of 1.8 million concurrent players.</p>
<p>Having said that, user reception on Steam is far from optimal. The average user review score is just 54%, a far cry from the 89% average score of Monster Hunter World and the 82% average score of Monster Hunter Rise. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> touched upon the reasons for this: the low challenge level and poor PC performance.</p>
<p><em>What most players are never going to get used to is performance, at least on PC. Just as the system requirements and the benchmark tool suggested, performance is really all over the place, reaching an acceptable level of smoothness only with Frame Generation. [...] In the heat of the hunt, I did not notice the frame rate drops too often, but watching the recording, in reality, it was very choppy instead. So, if you don't have a top-of-the-line machine, you may have to drop most settings and resolution to hit 60 FPS, which is the bare minimum for a game like this. Following the game and Dragon's Dogma 2, it's quite clear how the RE Engine may not have all it takes to handle open-world experiences properly.</em></p>
<p>Both areas can definitely be worked on post-launch by the developers, which could lead to a drastic increase in the game's average user score on Steam. However, if Dragon's Dogma 2 is any indication, that game's equally poor performance did not significantly improve post-release. It seems like the developers may still have work to be done at an engine level to make sure the RE Engine runs well in open world games like Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can try user-made mods and see if they make a positive difference to your gameplay experience. For instance, Nexus user Darex2094 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found improvements</a> in the game's stuttering by replacing the Direct Storage.dll file with the latest version.</p>
