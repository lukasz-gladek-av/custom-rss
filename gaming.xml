            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A brand new retro SNES gem is now available via Nintendo Switch Online in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, and if you happen to own a Switch 2, you're in luck.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950001200637890859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media</a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>is available now for standard Switch Online members (and those with the Expansion Pack addon, of course), and what's more, it <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950001356699312467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fully supports</a> the Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 mouse control feature.</p>

<p>Nintendo says that if you're playing on the original Switch, you can sub in a standard USB mouse and use that instead of the Joy-Cons if you want. Presumably, you can also do that on the Switch 2, although I can't confirm whether that's the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online-music.jpg?itok=uPsdnXYT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online-music.jpg?itok=KvvnDeWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>is now available via Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>Everything you could do in the original SNES release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>is, of course, still possible in the Nintendo Switch Online re-release. That includes composing music, coloring in existing images, and, naturally, drawing pictures of your own.</p>

<p>Thanks to Switch Online, though, there are a few extra features you can take advantage of now. You can save up to four compositions and drawings thanks to the suspend feature, and, of course, you can now play it in handheld mode as well.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>hitting the Switch Online library, some of its most iconic tracks are also now available as part of the Nintendo Music app, so if you like listening to the Gnat Attack theme while you work out, Nintendo's got you covered.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online, which feels just a touch more irreverent than Nintendo's usual trailers, right here.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>right now if you're a Switch Online member. Unlike the service's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2" rel="nofollow">GameCube lineup</a>, as well as its N64 or Game Boy Advance titles, you won't need the Expansion Pack to enjoy this one.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Set to become a concrete requirement early next year</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft have become the latest company to start introducing age verification measures in response to the the Online Safety Act that's just come into force in the UK. Folks logging into Xbox services with a Microsoft account from today will start getting optional notifications directing them to verify they're over 18, with the checks becoming a hard requirement in early 2026.</p>
<p>To be clear, these checks are UK-only for now, in line with this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act">new legislation</a> that aims to stop users who aren't verified as over 18 seeing content that's illegal or deemed unsuitable for children.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this is outlined in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire post</a> penned by the console maker's vice president of gaming trust and safety, Kim Kunes. If you're on Sadness Island and have a Microsoft account that flags your age as 18 and over, then you should start getting notifications asking you to confirm how old you are via third-party verification software Yoti soon.</p>
<p>The check'll require you to take a live photo, upload one of your government-issued ID (in the form of a passport, driving licence, or national ID card), provide your mobile phone number, or enter your credit card details. So, the usual suite of stuff you'd probably rather not be giving out on a whim.</p>
<p>For now, these checks will stay optional, meaning you can truck on in the short term and retain access to all the usual features. Though, if you opt not to do it, once early 2026 rolls around a number of features on your account will be limited to working with friends only. These include voice and text comms, party functionality, game invites, and "user generated content", including the activity feed.</p>
<p>You'll also totally lose access to the looking for group and custom clubs features, Discord integration, and the ability to broadcast gameplay to Twitch.</p>
<p>"As this age verification process rolls out across the UK, we’ll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process," Kunes wrote, "We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences."</p>
<p>In addition to forcing folks to upload snaps of their mugs to prove they're old enough to see a boob or a swear, the introduction of this Online Safety Act in the UK has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon">led to modding sites changing how they handle adult content</a>, with some interesting consequences for certain modders and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-modder-makes-npc-cleanliness-optional-in-order-to-avoid-popular-non-sexy-mods-being-hidden-unnecessarily">their works</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act]]></content:encoded>

The former had its own pretty decent two-season TV series between 2018 and 2019, with a fantastic cast including Sissy Spacek, Lizzy Caplan, Tim Robbins, Melanie Lynskey and Bill Skarsgård. This October, we’re a couple of towns over, to the home of everyone’s favorite party clown, Pennywise.</p><p>Created as a prequel to the events of <em>It</em>, <em>Welcome to Derry</em> is a sort of origin story for the book’s monstrous clown. Intended to be three seasons (although this of course requires HBO to allow <em>anything</em> a chance to tell its story), the first is set in 1962, while the second will be in 1935 and the third in 1908. Intriguing.</p><p>The show has been co-developed by Andy Muschietti, who directed both of the recent <em>It</em> movies, and&nbsp;Bill Skarsgård (yes, him again) will reprise his role as Pennywise, so it’s clearly set in the same universe as those very successful films. Beyond that, not a great deal is known, beyond the clues pulled from this new trailer.</p><p>Obviously there’s to be more than just the clown’s antics. The trailer talks of a more complicated town, and there are lots of glimpses of other supernatural events taking place. However, given the time it’s set, it seems unlikely to incorporate the many other stories King has set in the area. Derry is also the home of <em>Secret Window, Secret Garden</em> (a stunning novella and a pretty dreadful Johnny Depp movie), <em>Bag of Bones</em>, <em>Dreamcatcher</em>, <em>11/22/63</em> and my personal all-time favorite King novel, <em>Insomnia</em>. Oh dear god please <em>someone</em> try to develop that book as a TV series—it’s surely the only King novel no one’s ever tried, and given it overlaps with <em>It</em>, <em>Bag of Bones</em>, <em>Gerald’s Game</em>, <em>Pet Sematary</em>, and most of all, <em>The Dark Tower</em>, it seems like it’d be an incredible project! (Although if Ralph Roberts doesn’t appear as a younger man in <em>Welcome to Derry</em>, I will lose my faith in the universe.)</p><p>We only have a few months to wait to see if HBO’s series can live up to expectations. In the meantime, make sure to watch both of Muschietti’s <em>It</em> movies (it was split into two because the book is <em>enormous</em>)—given the plan is to tell the entire story chronologically backwards, it definitely makes sense to start with the films.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> is working on a new live-service game, despite the high profile flop of Suicide Squad last year.</p>
<p>A new job for an executive producer at WB Games Montréal has been <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/">listed</a>, which includes mention of development "from concept to post-launch live operations", and the experience required includes "deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services".</p>
<p>While the game itself isn't specified, it will be a "high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalogue".</p>

<p>WB Games Montréal previously developed DC game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, which - while not live-service - was another flop for the company. In December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">99 developers from the studio were laid off</a>.</p>
<p>Now it seems it's beginning to ramp up development on its next project.</p>
<p>Back in February, DC boss James Gunn confirmed he'd been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games">in talks with both Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop new games in the DC Universe</a>.</p>
<p>It's unknown if WB Games Montréal is also working on a DC game. In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">Warner Bros. Games announced a shift in leadership</a> as it refocuses its efforts on its biggest franchises: DC, Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>The DC Universe is perhaps the most likely candidate for another live-service game. However, this would follow the failures of Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, which struggled to find an audience. That resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">41 percent drop in Warner Bros. gaming revenue</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">layoffs at the studio later in the year due to it underperforming</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New Game Plus! Level cap boost! More!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's next big patch for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is available today, July 29, 2025, and the publisher has now given a detailed rundown of everything included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">previously announced</a>, Title Update 1.0.7 adds New Game Plus mode, which will unlock as soon as you hit the credits after completing the game's story. From here, you have a couple of options: either to restart the game from scratch, or pick up the action from when Naoe first arrives at the game's hideout. Either way, your hard-earned gear, skills, allies and hideout progression will carry over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're playing New Game Plus or not, there's a level cap increase from 60 to 80, and a boost in the Knowledge Rank cap from 8 to 10, allowing you to counter the game's higher-level enemies with the ability to unlock more skills. You can also now upgrade gear at your Forge to level 4, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweat your way through Shadows' story a second time via New Game Plus and you'll unlock a gold katana and long katana for Naoe and Yasuke, respectively, and also snag the last of the following three new achievements/trophies, which this update also adds:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Enjoy the Ride:</strong> Reach Level 80 </li><li><strong>Stars Unseen:</strong> Reach Knowledge Rank 10 </li><li><strong>Worth its Wait:</strong> Complete the story on New Game Plus </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Ubisoft has rebalanced some of the game's money and resources. Players will likely be happy to see a boosted amount of Mon now given from selling items, while purchased items cost less. You'll also get more resources from dismantling items and from end of season chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is set to continue updating Shadows for the forseeable future, with a further patch due in early September that will add the ability to fast-forward the time of day and better unfog the world map when synchronising viewpoints. Assassin's Creed Shadows' first major expansion, Claws of Awaji, then arrives on September 16 as the game's first paid add-on — though it will be free for anyone who originally pre-ordered the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Find today's full patch notes below:

            <p>Nintendo Switch Online members can now get their very artistically capable hands on Mario Paint.</p>
<p>Mario Paint originally released all the way back in 1992 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or SNES. It uses mouse controls to draw pictures. "You can even create animated sequences and write music to add to your collage," reads Mario Paint's official blurb. "Bring your very own video creations to life by combining animation and music with the art you've made!"</p>
<p>Mario Paint is available on both the original Switch and the recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. While Switch 2 users will of course be able to utilise the console's mouse functionality, those on Nintendo's original console will need to get hold of a compatible USB mouse. </p>
<p>In addition, Nintendo has added the music from Mario Paint to the Nintendo Music App. You can check out a trailer for Mario Paint below.</p>

			<p>Developer Monster Theatre has created an approachable roguelike in Atomic Owl, the studio’s debut title. You’re cast as Hidalgo Bladewing, out for revenge after losing a battle against Crow Sorcerer Omega Wing, which saw Hidalgo imprisoned and lose his friends to dark influence. The game itself is a compact Metroidvania that can be beaten in around six hours, but does it sustain its runtime?</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomic Owl - Official Launch Trailer | Indie3 Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XhW86Kdn9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomic Owl follows a standard roguelike formula of making as much progress as possible, dying, getting some upgrades, and then progressing further on your next run. That’s made easier, though, as Hidalgo levels up during runs by collecting green Meza. As Hidaglo levels up, his health increases, which means each run becomes that little bit more forgiving. Alongside green Meza, there’s a blue variant, which is collected from defeated enemies, and this is the currency used to unlock or improve abilities, such as getting permanent extra lives or increasing the range to absorb Mesa. </p>


<p>There are also further abilities called Wing Remnants. Some enemies drop Wing Remnants and provide bonuses for that specific run, with these including triple jump, an additional dash, or being able to deal fire damage. Wing Remnants are removed at the end of each run, and you never know what you’re going to get.</p>


<p>Atomic Owl is relatively straightforward, with combat and platforming easy to pick up. Hidalgo has access to four weapons, including a greatsword, a whip, throwable axes, and a big hammer. There’s also a scythe, which has limited throws and a cooldown. It does decent damage and can take out multiple enemies if they are in range, which is great when you are getting swarmed. Occasionally, you to need to use a specific weapon to destroy an enemy shield. The combat is not challenging, including the boss fights, with easily readable patterns. Considering the bosses are supposed to be powerful warriors, I was quite surprised how easy it was to defeat them. It may be due to wanting players to keep moving forward, but a little challenge would have been welcome.</p>
<p>The platforming is good throughout Atomic Owl, although there were a couple of moments where it felt a bit fiddly. There was one section where Hidalgo would fall off moving platforms every so often while being swarmed by enemies, and there’s a section near the end where you’re being pursued, which has moments of frustration as you need to be precise to avoid being caught. The platforming is, in my opinion, more of a challenge than the game’s combat.</p>

<p>The visual design of Atomic Owl follows classic pixel art and it has a lot of colour to it, though you can add a CRT and/or Samurai filter to give it a retro or black and white look. There’s a mix of styles across each level, from a small cityscape and woodlands, to more retro-futuristic looks in the training rooms and later levels. The blend of styles helps to keep things fresh as you make progress. The only real complaint I have is that in a couple of darker areas is can be a bit hard to see the platforms you’re supposed to leap onto. The great visual design is matched by the catchy accompanying soundtrack , though there is a level near the end where things are purposefully out of place, which won’t be for everyone. </p>

	<div id="gp-summary">
		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Atomic Owl is a satisfying roguelike with a simple progression that allows you to make headway quickly through the levels. This does come at the expense of the combat, which is a bit too on the easy side, with the platforming much more challenging than any boss fight. Overall though, if you want a short, simple, and good looking roguelike then Atomic Owl is worth a go.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brazil is home to the 10th largest video game market globally with an estimated 103 million players diving into video games across the region. According to data published by local advocacy group Abragames (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nordicity.com/de/cache/work/188/The%20Golden%20Opportunity%20White%20Paper.pdf">as featured in a recent Nordicity white paper</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) the Brazilian industry generated USD $251.6 million in revenue in 2022 and employed roughly 13,225 people as of 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, the white paper also states that almost half of studios in the country rely on internal resources to bring their projects to market, with only 16 percent receiving investment from international publishers and 10 percent securing other private investments.It's a data snapshot that provides a glimpse into a region that's seemingly bristling with potential but is in dire need of support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does that track with the sentiments of developers actually crafting video games in the region? We flew out to Gamescom Latam 2025 to find out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unrivalled creativity hampered by a funding 'bottleneck'">Unrivalled creativity hampered by a funding 'bottleneck'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sense around the Abragames booth, which featured a litany of wonderful projects created by developers in the region, was that teams in Brazil are passionately creative, eager to learn, but also somewhat outmanned and outgunned due to a lack of consistent governmental support, scant external investment opportunities, and a talent pool that lacks veteran experience.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-cloning-horizon-series" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony files lawsuit against Tencent for allegedly cloning Horizon series</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In terms of building teams, we have a lot of great talent here in Brazil. I think the most challenging part is funding [because] Brazil is very strong in terms of games. Being at this event, where there are thousands of people passing by, you can see it's super competitive," says Gabriel Garcia, founder and CEO of Rio-based studio Hype Animation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple developers said there are a decent number of prototype funds available to studios in Brazil, but there aren't many designed to help teams clear late-stage production hurdles. Garcia agrees and says there is a "bottleneck" where funding is concerned that often prevents studios from moving forward with their work once they hit a certain point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also feels Brazilian developers have become adept at highlighting their local culture to great effect, which can help their projects stand out on the international stage. "We have a lot of stories to tell," he adds, before acknowledging that, right now, the people attempting to tell those stories are often working in small-scale studios that don't have the clout of their counterparts in North America.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's an issue, because Brazil needs to keep its talented developers on home soil so they can gain invaluable experience that will in turn allow local studios to turn their biggest dreams into reality.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/itch-io-posts-new-adult-content-guidelines" target="_self" data-discover="true">Itch.io posts new adult content guidelines</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another developer dealing with similar issues is Arthur Silva Aguiar, lead game designer at Caramelo Games, who said the biggest challenge the studio has faced is finding the right people for specific roles.&nbsp;"[It's tough] to find qualified people. We have a lot of extremely talented people in Brazil, but they're not always well versed in the development process," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Caramelo is currently working on a Pokemon-like called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bagdex</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that has been in development for around 18 months. The studio managed to raise $200,000 to finance the project via a crowdfunding campaign, but despite that interest has struggled to attract publishers outside Brazil. "Brazilians support us, but we do not have the right traction outside the country and that's where we're actually looking for funding."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;There's lots of mythology here in Brazil that's been forgotten&quot;">"There's lots of mythology here in Brazil that's been forgotten"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a situation that perhaps means Brazilian developers need to be more vigilant when it comes to scoping their projects. Eter Games executive producer Bruno Cricenti, whose studio is currently developing a third-person adventure based on Brazilian folklore called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Matinta</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, explains his team actually received a government grant to accelerate the development process—but the understandable interest in those financial boons means there "is a lot of competition" among local studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/investors-and-publishers-share-their-pitching-tips-at-gamescom-latam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Investors and publishers share their pitching tips at Gamescom Latam</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to have more structured projects and pitches, and should know where to sell and what markets you want to enter based on the genre of game you're making," he says, explaining how studios might stand out when pitching for funding. "We got a grant for our vertical slice but we had invested our own money before that to build the prototype."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He, like others in the country, explains the studio is now struggling to find investors that are willing to push the project over the finish line after around two-and-a-half years in development. "That's really difficult right now," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The appeal of building video games in Brazil, for Cricenti, is the penchant for creativity in the region. "There's lots of mythology here in Brazil that's been forgotten that we're trying to bring it back and put it inside our own production," he adds. Even so, he underlines how vital it is for developers to balance their aspirations when meeting with investors and publishers. "Try to be very focused on what you want to do," he continues. "Try to build a short game to test the market before investing too much of your money and your time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Marcelo Rigon, CEO of Ilex Games, has been making video games in Brazil for around 22 years. He explains the market has matured rapidly in that time and recalls how he was branded "crazy" in 2003 when he approached an incubation program looking for funding to start his studio. At that stage, he says the region didn't have any local publishers or distribution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The only way we could try to publish our game inside Brazil was to have a contact at magazines who would place CDs in their publications," he explains. He claims a lot of investors and decision-makers in Brazil still "don't understand the market of games," which is why studios in the region often look for financing beyond its borders. "It's hard for us to get [local investment] because they think gaming is so risky and they don't know how to approach that," he adds.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are local organizations such as Sebrae Nacional that are dedicated to promoting the development of small businesses in Brazil, including game studios. Rigon explains those advocates are attempting to teach investors how and why they should be investing in the video game industry. He also claims there is "a lot of public funding" available to developers at the moment, but says the turbulent political climate in Brazil means there are no guarantees it will stick around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, he says former Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro—who led the country between 2019 to 2023 (often stoking controversy in the process)—"destroyed" a lot of support systems that were helping the Brazilian game industry—including a number of grants that were scrapped when he entered office just before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of those grants have now been reinstated, but Rigon says it means Brazil has somewhat stagnated over the past half-decade. There are some notable wins, however, such as the creation of a full cycle grant program that will allow successful applicants to move beyond prototyping. The next step is to ensure those opportunities are available to developers playing their trade in all 27 Brazilian states—and the key, says Rigon, is for everyone to push for change as a united front.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I am the president of the Sao Paulo Association of Game Developers. We have 21 states with regional associations. We need to improve the kind of grants, finance treaties, and other things across the industry," he says. "We can push the politics in the right direction if we are together."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Helping developers learn how to run a sustainable business is vital">Helping developers learn how to run a sustainable business is vital</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After finishing our stroll around the showfloor we sit down for a chat with Abragames president Rodrigo Terra and the group's executive manager for the Brazil Games Export program, Patricia Sato.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sato feels there are more eyes than ever before on the Brazilian game industry, which is perhaps evidenced by the level of interest and presence of major global publishers such as Nintendo, Microsoft, Epic Games, and Supercell at Gamescom Latam. Now, she explains, the region needs to figure out how to ride that wave.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Terra believes education is absolutely fundamental if Brazil hopes to cement its place on the global stage. He says 93 percent of the region's studios are small in scale, and while they're filled with "incredible professionals," they aren't necessarily experienced managers or business leaders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We need to invest in business education," he says. "I think thats the next step in really reaching the global market. It's hard, because people start out as a game designer or game writer. They they start a small business because they're trying to ship a game—but they don't even know how to manage your cash flow. That's a challenge we need to overcome, and people need knowledge to do it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How then, can Brazil, nurture that raw talent to ensure its burgeoning studio ecosystem isn't devoid of the business acumen required to expand internationally? The answer for Terra is simple: "you make it political."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Developers need to built and organize themselves as entities that can lobby the government," he continues. "Abragames does that job, but we cannot do it alone. [...] We need to think about how, as game professionals, can we be active politically in a certain way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sato explains Abragames has been trying to help developers understand they need to participate in the video game industry in a deeper way in order to usher in mandates for public policies that can benefit everybody. There's nothing wrong with developers sharing advice among themselves—but Abragames feels they must become more unified and proactive when lobbying government for additional support in order to deliver stability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the government changes, everything changes," says Terra. "But there are some state initiatives that are enshrined in law—so when it's a law it's better for you as a society, as an organization."</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talent retention is another issue both Sato and Terra feel must be addressed. They suggest Brazil routinely suffers from "brain drain" when industry experts depart the region to work for larger, more established companies elsewhere. It's not a challenge unique to Brazil—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-triumphs-and-struggles-of-the-resurgent-australian-game-industry">during my trip to Australia two years ago, we heard how it had impacted the dev scene there</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—but one that must be overcome nevertheless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had a very important generation of Brazilian video game experts who emerged around 15 years ago," explains Terra. "Then the knowledge was lost."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Terra claims Brazil must convince major studios to put down roots in the country in order to retain talent, and there have been positive signs in that regard. In 2023, Epic Games purchased local studio AQUIRIS and rebranded it as Epic Games Brasil. Service providers such as Keywords and Side have also put down roots in the region.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's important because you need those juggernauts," says Terra. "They will train professionals from the Brazilian companies and they're going to maybe pay more. Then, a couple of years later, some of those professionals will leave those companies to perhaps start their own. Or they will start working and partnering with other Brazilian studios. The knowledge transfer will have a massive impact [on the Brazilian game industry]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the subject of funding, Abragames believes things are heading in the right direction. We're told there are discussions about designing grants to help developers complete and distribute their projects. Terra also says Sao Paulo is creating a "match grant" that will see the state double whatever a publisher invests in a game project. "It's good for the studio. It's good for the publisher. And the state is doing its part," says Terra. "You create this mechanism to be more attractive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The prevailing takeaway from our discussion with Abragames is that talent and passion can only take Brazil so far—and that the real challenge facing the region is determining how to transform primordial passion into something more structured.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As game developers, we are all passionate about creating games, telling stories, and building mechanics. But passion sometimes overtakes you and prevents you from thinking about the whole ecosystem," says Terra. "The thing is, if you want to do business you need to create relations and network. You need to live together, work together,&nbsp; and see whether your company is capable of not just shipping one game—but shipping dozens. [...] If you want to open a business you need to transform that passion into love to create a relationship with the market, create a relationship with people, and start building your business."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer was invited to Gamescom Latam by event partner Abragames, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-make-it-political-how-can-the-brazilian-game-industry-establish-itself-on-the-global-stage-]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wb-games-montr%C3%A9al-might-be-making-another-dc-comics-live-service-game.1255713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In October 2024, a job listing <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-montreal-rumored-to-be-working-on-new-dc-comics-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that WB Games Montréal was recruiting for a new game based on a DC Comics license. That was fairly unsurprising in itself, considering that the developer has only ever worked on such games, from 2013's Batman: Arkham Origins to 2022's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gotham-knights-batfamilys-competent-but-no-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gotham Knights</a>. Now, though, <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another job listing</a> suggests that this project is being designed as a live service, which was enough to ruffle the feathers of many fans. </p>



<p>The job listing is for an Executive Producer who would oversee many aspects of the game's development, including the planned live service operations, as stated in the excerpt below.</p>



<p><em>As an Executive Producer, you will lead the development of a high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalog. You will oversee the entire production lifecycle—from concept to launch and beyond—ensuring the game meets the highest standards of quality, innovation, and player engagement. You will work closely with the Creative Director and studio leadership to align creative vision with production realities, manage cross-functional teams, and ensure the project delivers on time, on budget, and to critical and commercial success.</em></p>



<p><strong><u><em>Production Oversight:</em></u></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Oversee all phases of development, from concept to post-launch live operations.</em></li>



<li><em>Ensure robust QA and live operations processes are in place to support a high-quality player experience.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Execution and Market Readiness:</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Oversee post-launch content and live service strategy, ensuring ongoing player engagement.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Anyone who followed Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will understand why many fans are already quite disappointed by the prospect. Created specifically as a live service game based on the popular team of DC Comics antiheroes, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failed so spectacularly that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused</a> a $200 million lower EBITDA and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">41% year-to-year decrease in revenue</a> for Warner Bros. Games compared to the previous highly successful launch of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>Granted, one game's failure does not equal another. Sure, there have been several failed live service games over the last few years, but a few have also succeeded, and when they do, they rake in big money. That's why publishers keep trying, and we already have plenty of indication that WB Games (now restructured into four divisions dedicated to its tentpole franchises) has not been deterred by the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. They are <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eager to make a Hogwarts Legacy live service game</a>, after all.</p>



<p>Of course, it's way too early to say which DC Comics license WB Games Montréal will use for its next project. Still, we'll keep an eye out for further listings and rumors.</p>

            <p>PlayStation maker Sony is suing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> for allegedly ripping off its Horizon video game franchise.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent development studio Polaris Quest revealed Light of Motiram</a>, a post-apocalyptic open-world survival crafting game with mechanised animal-like creatures which looked remarkably similar to Guerrilla and PlayStation's Horizon series.</p>
<p>Now, Sony is suing Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement in California federal court, calling Light of Motiram a "slavish clone" of the Horizon games.</p>

<p>The complaint by Sony alleges Tencent's Light of Motiram is unlawfully similar to both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which was originally released in 2017, and its sequel Forbidden West, which came out in 2022. Not only that, the filing revealed that Tencent began working on Light of Motiram in 2023, before it approached Sony in 2024 with a pitch to create its own Horizon game in collaboration with the PlayStation maker. However, when Sony rejected this proposition, Tencent "continued secretly developing Light of Motiram", before announcing its game later that year.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Sony approached Tencent informally to resolve the copyright dispute once it became aware of Light of Motiram's existence. However, Sony said when it approached Tencent about the issue, Tencent once again tried to obtain a licence to use Horizon assets, which Sony again declined. Tencent then continued on regardless.</p>
<p>"Sony is thus forced to file this action and seek judicial relief to protect its valuable and hard-earned intellectual property rights in the Horizon franchise," the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Sony's complaint states Tencent's promotional materials including trailers and screenshots for Light of Motiram "misappropriated protectable elements of [Sony Interactive Entertainment's] copyrights in the Horizon franchise" to a "significant degree". This includes gameplay, story themes, characters, landscapes and other artistic elements. Sony noted the music used to promote Light of Motiram is also "highly similar" to Horizon's own.</p>
<p>The complaint goes on to additionally cite community comments as well as various headlines from websites, which all point out the striking similarities between Light of Motiram and the Horizon games. One screenshotted comment  from Light of Motiram's Steam page shared within the complaint reads: "Not only does it look like a copy of the Horizon games, but you had the cheek to copy the cover art as well."</p>
<p>Sony says Tencent has "confused" consumers with its promotional material, with many assuming Light of Motiram is affiliated with the Horizon series. Sony additionally shared several examples showing just how similar Light of Motiram's promotional material is to Horizon. You can see some of the shared examples below.</p>

			<p>During a panel hosted at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, Free Range Games and North Beach Games announced Durin's Folk, an expansion to the survival game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. Not many details were revealed at this point, except for an expanded end-game story, 'exciting' new game mechanics, and many more yet-to-be-revealed secrets.</p>

<p>As you might recall, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-is-out-october-24-for-pc-ps5-features-john-rhys-davies-as-gimli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in October 2023</a> for PC and PlayStation 5. Initially, it was a console exclusive for Sony's console and a PC exclusive for the Epic Games Store. That changed in August 2024, when Free Range Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-now-available-on-steam-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released it</a> on Steam and Xbox Series S|X with cross-play between all platforms.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was updated to optionally support dedicated servers. They can either be rented for a fee from a third-party provider or hosted by users. Owners of a dedicated server can then tweak specific settings to their liking, such as:</p>

<p><em><strong>setdifficulty</strong>&nbsp;- sets all of the server's difficulty settings to use a preset</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>setdifficulty story</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty solo</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty normal</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty hard</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty custom</em></strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>‍<strong>setcustomdifficulty [name] [value]&nbsp;</strong>- sets the specified difficulty setting [name] to the given value. Eg.&nbsp;setcustomdifficulty [combatdifficulty] [verylow]</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>Names:&nbsp;</em></strong>
<ul>
<li><em>combatdifficulty&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>enemyaggression</em></li>



<li><em>survivaldifficulty</em></li>



<li><em>miningdrops</em></li>



<li><em>worlddrops</em></li>



<li><em>hordefrequency</em></li>



<li><em>siegefrequency</em></li>



<li><em>patrolfrequency</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em><strong>Values</strong>:&nbsp;</em>
<ul>
<li><em>verylow, low, default, high, veryhigh&nbsp;‍</em></li>



<li><em>Not all of the named settings have the same range of values - some don’t have&nbsp;<strong>verylow, veryhigh</strong>&nbsp;so if those value are chosen, it will be set to&nbsp;<strong>low or high</strong>&nbsp;instead.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Durin's Folk expansion is truly to launch soon, the developers may try to match the second anniversary of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, which is in around three months from now, on October 24, to be exact. Anyway, we'll keep you updated on any official announcements from Free Range Games.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ahead of EVO 2025 later this week, Arc System Works has finally shared an update about the Switch version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a>, which was released at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Following a previous update, the development team has now confirmed the DLC characters Venom, Unika and Lucy will be made available for the Switch in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>. This version of the game is also expected to bring the Nintendo version "up to speed with the latest version".</p>
<p>This includes balance adjustments, ranked matches, and also plans to address some text issues. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>Guilty Gear Strive Nintendo Switch Edition Update (Fall 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the long wait regarding the update for Guilty Gear -Strive- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Venom and Unika, along with Lucy, are planned for an update in the Fall of 2025.<br>
Development for the Nintendo Switch Edition involves porting the character after completion, followed by sequential optimization and processing load reduction.</p>
<p>The Fall 2025 update is expected to bring it up to speed with the latest version, including not only playable character additions but also Digital Figures, balance adjustments, and Ranked Matches. Additionally, we are addressing issues where text is difficult to read in some language settings. Please look forward to the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows multiple DLC character updates for other platforms. The Switch version of the game includes 28 playable characters in the base package, including the first three seasons of the title.</p>

<p>Unlock a new theme next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>DK is back in his latest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and apart from new merch and promotions in mobile games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, he's also getting his very own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> event.</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo's Switch Online-focused battle-royale <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/tetris">Tetris</a> game will be hosting a special event between <strong>1st - 4th August, 2025</strong>. In this limited-time Maximus Cup, you'll be able to unlock a theme including special art, music and Tetrimino designs once you've accumulated 100 event points.</p>
<p>This event marks the 48th Maximus Cup event. If you haven't played Donkey Kong Bananza yet, you can check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest update for Tetris 99 follows a Maximus Cup in June, which saw the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/tetris-99s-new-maximus-cup-sees-the-return-of-four-nintendo-themes">four Nintendo themes</a>.</p>

<p>If there's anything significant going on behind the scenes of this latest update, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Alongside this update, Nintendo has also released a new game for the SNES digital library today, and it makes use of mouse support (including the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode). Nintendo also added mouse support to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-a-mouse-game">few other games in the same library</a>, as well as adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-can-now-remap-super-nes-controls-with-nintendo-switch-online">the ability to remap buttons</a> in the SNES app, bringing it in line with the functionality of the N64 and GameCube apps.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nintendo is kicking off its Switch Online Playtest today in select locations. You can find out more about this in our previous coverage.</p>

                <p>If you've ever been on a ride at any of the major theme parks, then you should know that they can and will break at the most inopportune times.

And as seen in the clip below, the guest lights up and smokes a little weed while waiting for the ride to resume.</p><p>Universal High was quick to point out that the video was first posted by someone else on Instagram, but that original video appears to have been removed. The currently unidentified fan does have some distinctive tattoos on his hand and thumb.

<p>Mario Paint is finally back!!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've been waiting to see the Super Nintendo title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> make a return, we've kind of got some exciting news today.</p>
<p>The game has officially been added to the SNES app for Switch Online users. The catch is, it requires a mouse. On Switch 2, you can use the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls to play the game, and for original Switch users, you can simply plug in a compatible USB mouse.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description for Mario Paint and you can see the game in action in the video above. Japan has received the <a href="https://youtu.be/uBn3orcH6O0">same update this week</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1992 Super NES game turns your system into a canvas, with an array of colors and drawing tools available to create digital works of art. You can even animate your drawings and compose music to craft your own video creations! Get ready to unlock your inner artist using the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality on Nintendo Switch 2, or by using a compatible USB mouse (sold separately) on a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch – OLED Model system.</p>
<p>And just like in the original game, you can access the Coloring Book featuring fun designs and character art or play the Gnat Attack training game for some extra mouse control fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this release, Nintendo has also added the Mario Paint soundtrack to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app today. All up, it features 19 tracks with a total runtime of 28 minutes.</p>
<p>To access Mario Paint on the Switch 2 or Switch, you'll need to have an active Switch Online membership. This will also allow you to listen to the game's album on Nintendo's Music app.</p>
<p>And to top it off, this update for the SNES app has <a href="https://youtu.be/BFpqxvRw9qI">also added mouse support</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario Super Picross</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nobunagas_ambition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a> (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-paint-gets-surprise-nintendo-switch-online-release-features-mouse-controls/">via Nintendo Everything</a>). Today's update to the 'Nintendo Classics' library <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/rumour-nintendo-may-be-looking-to-add-snes-mouse-support-to-switch-online">follows a rumour last year</a> about Switch Online getting mouse compatibility.</p>
<p>Today's digital SNES library update has taken place alongside the latest Switch 2 and Switch firmware update, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-3-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">bumping the systems up to Version 20.3.0</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything You Need to Know About Board Game Arena]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-arena-subscription-plans</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-you-need-to-know-about-board-game-arena.1255611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting a group of friends together to learn and play a board game can be a daunting task. Not only does it require everyone in-person, but between setting up, learning the rules, and actually playing through the game it can end up taking multiple hours. Thankfully, there's an online solution that solves many of these issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena might be one of the best-kept secrets, despite having more than 10 million registered players. Still, the flexibility to play many of the most popular games today whenever you desire makes it a must for board game enthusiasts. With a massive catalog spanning every genre, it's got plenty to offer for both casual and hardcore players alike. Check out our full breakdown below to learn more about Board Game Arena, some of the included games, pricing, and what devices are supported.</p><p id="what-is-board-game-arena"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is Board Game Arena?">What Is Board Game Arena?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> that allows you to play more than <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamelist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,000 popular board games</a>—completely free. What's the catch? Surprisingly, there isn't one. It really is as good as it sounds. A metaphorical board game buffet just waiting to be devoured.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The browser-based website is pretty lightweight, allowing it to run seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. You can play games in real-time with players from across the world or set up a turn-based match that lets players take turns when it's convenient for them. While this significantly increases the time it takes to complete a game, it's a flexible option that's perfect for those with a busy schedule who can't dedicate the time it takes to sit down and play longer games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">How it works</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Most games include a step-by-step guided tutorial, which is the perfect way to learn a new game that doesn't require combing through a massive rulebook. Many also have links to educational videos if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best part about Board Game Arena is that the entire experience is automated. That means no more worrying about the rules or players potentially cheating. Each game features a simple interface that clearly indicates which moves you can make at any given moment. This also helps games move along at a brisk pace, as there's no setup, teardown, or fiddling with components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can create digital tables and indicate the number of opponents they are looking for before starting a match. Generally, finding players is quick, with tables often filled in a matter of seconds. Some games even include expansion content, which you can decide to enable when setting up your table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each game features a built-in text chat option to interact with your friends or opponents. And, if you want to host a virtual game night and get the full experience, optional voice and video chat are also available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because many board games require a lot of time and commitment, Board Game Arena leverages a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/news?id=304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reputation system for all players</a>. Anyone who takes too long to make a move or leaves a game before it's finished receives a penalty. This allows you to quickly identify potential problem players and avoid matching with them to ensure a positive play experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players looking to test their ability, Board Game Arena also offers ranked matches and tournaments for every game. This is a great way to face off against some of the best players in the world and improve your skill.</p><p id="subscription-tiers"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Subscription Tiers">How Much Does Board Game Arena Cost?</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is available in two tiers: free and Premium. The free tier only requires that you create a free account in order to access the catalog of games. However, you'll quickly find that many of the most popular games have the "Premium" badge on them, which means you can't start a table unless you have a paid subscription. If you're patient, though, you can wait for another premium member to set up a table and join for free.</p><div catalogid="9b93e6b9-077f-4e03-9675-f0d3733462be" id="225356"><div id="225356" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Board Game Arena</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, to experience the best of Board Game Arena without any restrictions, you'll want to sign up for a Premium account. Like most <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-subscription-services">game subscription services</a>, you can pay monthly or yearly, with the latter being a bit cheaper in comparison. Board Game Arena's is priced at <strong>$5 per month</strong> or <strong>$42 per year</strong> (which works out to about $3.50 a month). For less than the price of a new board game you can experience more than 1,000—with more added every week.</p></div><p id="games-included"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Games Included">What Games Does Board Game Arena Include?</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/25/wingspan-board-game-review-1674676696680.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena features some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">most popular board games</a> available today, including: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">Wingspan</a>, Splendor, and Res Arcana; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">Azul</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/15/ticket-to-ride-review">Ticket to Ride</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harmonies-board-game-review">Harmonies</a>; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a> like Pandemic, Sky Team, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-review">The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game</a>, and many, many more. The best part—new games are added weekly, so there's always something to look forward to and play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more experienced players, there are plenty of longer, more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic games</a> that typically need a well-versed group to play including Terraforming Mars, Ark Nova, and Terra Mystica. While these games can take hours in-person, the instant setup and automated turn structure helps them move much faster than their real-world counterparts, making this the ideal way to play many of these heavier games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although most games require two or more players to enjoy, Board Game Arena has a vast catalog of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo games</a> for players who prefer that format. Many modern games also include a solo variant, allowing you to play against an <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/2414/blogpost/109521/what-is-an-automa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automa</a> and learn the strategy without the pressure of additional players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you only have a few minutes to spare, Board Game Arena also features dozens of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick board games</a> that can be played on your phone to give you your fix. The beauty of its massive catalog is that you can choose the perfect game based on how much time you have available.</p><p id="available-platforms"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Available Platforms">Board Game Arena - Available Platforms</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Board Game Arena is browser-based, it's available on just about any modern device that can access an internet browser. While you <em>can</em> play games on mobile, I find that some games' visual aspects don't scale well for the smaller screen. Your best bet is to play on PC, Mac, or even a tablet as each of these can fit more visuals and information on the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.

<p>A new trailer has also dropped</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<p><strong>Update #3 [<time datetime="2025-07-29T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 29th Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a>'s developer Siactro confirmed this latest entry would arrive on <strong>8th August 2025</strong> for <strong>$4.99</strong>. To go with this announcement, we've got another trailer.</p>
<p>Although the game is releasing on the original Switch, it will also be playable and purchasable on the Switch 2.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #2 [<time datetime="2024-12-08T07:00:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 8th Dec 2024, 7am</time>]:</strong></p><p>Following the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> last month, developer Siactro has now released a brand new gameplay trailer featuring the music track Blackbird Down (Toree Saturn OST) by KB. This game will arrive on Switch and PC in "early 2025".</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #1 [<time datetime="2024-11-24T13:35:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 24th Nov 2024, 1:35pm</time>]:</strong></p><p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> was scheduled to arrive this year on the Switch, developer Siactro has announced the game has now been delayed until early 2025. The quality would have apparently "suffered a lot" had it been released next month. Here's the message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am sorry, but I have to delay Toree Saturn into early 2025. A december release was possible, but the quality would have suffered a lot. I worked with really incredible people on this and I am not going to treat their work with a low quality release. I am very sorry!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>When we get a release date update, we'll be sure to let you know!</em></p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer and PC demo for the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a></strong> have been released, with the developer Siactro also reconfirming the new entry will arrive at some point in <strong>2024</strong>. This latest update mentions a Nintendo Switch release, too.</p>
<p>When this new project was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/toree-saturn-looks-set-to-provide-even-more-adorable-low-poly-platforming-next-year">originally announced in September last year</a>, there was no Nintendo announcement at that point, so there you go!</p>

<p>Here's a brief rundown about what to expect from the latest entry in this speed-based 3D platformer series (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549240/Toree_Saturn/">via Steam</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Run through linear levels from point A to B with a double jumping bird while avoiding enemies, collecting stars (if desired), and getting all kinds of little speed boosts along the way."</p>
<p>- Toree has two new moves! The player can now use a grounddash in mid air to descend faster and get a speedboost when impacting on the ground, as well as homing in on special stars to get a height and movement boost.​​</p>
<p>- New Looks! Toree Saturns artstyle tries to be a combination of late 90s 3D with some of the more crazy looks of the early Y2K era. It's like a natural evolution of the artstyle of the previous games... I hope.​​</p>
<p>- Controlling Toree got way easier!​<br>
No more Run-Button, meaning players don't have to hold down the right trigger for ages.​<br>
Most actions (except for the trigger for the ground dash) only use the Jump button.​<br>
Ground Dash is performed by the now freed Right Trigger of your controller (LMB if K&amp;M)</p>
