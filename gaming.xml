			<p>Season 1 of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">World of Warcraft: The War Within</a> starts tomorrow, which introduces a new Mythic+ season, Raiding and PvP, to engage in and try to bring up your rankings. This season is the first of the new expansion, meaning players will experience some new dungeons to join the game in a Mythic+ setting with Mythic affixes.</p>
<p>This also introduces Nerub-ar Palace on Normal and Heroic difficulty, with LFR getting access to Wing 1 of the raid. For the first week, players will only get to participate in Mythic 0 dungeons, which helps them prepare for the more challenging dungeons ahead. All Mythic+ dungeon difficulties will be available from September 17 onwards.</p>
<p>For those who want to know what to expect from the upcoming season, this guide will explain what Mythic+ dungeons you'll be seeing in the Mythic+ pool, as well as what affixes you'll be coming up against as you climb the Mythic+ rankings.</p>
<h2>What Mythic+ Dungeons Are There in The War Within Season 1?</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24137817/the-war-within-season-1-begins-september-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight new Mythic+ dungeons</a> for players to experience this season, four of which are from The War Within. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ara-Kara, City of Echoes</li>
<li>City of Threads</li>
<li>The Stonevault</li>
<li>The Dawnbreaker</li>
<li>Mists of Tirna Scithe (Shadowlands)</li>
<li>The Necrotic Wake (Shadowlands)</li>
<li>Siege of Boralus (Battle for Azeroth)</li>
<li>Grim Batol (Cataclysm)</li>
</ul>
<p>By participating in Mythic+ dungeons and earning Rating, you can unlock achievements, titles, and a mount for reaching a certain number of Rating.</p>
<p>You can work towards these seasonal rewards in Mythic+ Season 1 of The War Within.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keystone Explorer</strong>: Complete a Mythic+ Dungeon within the time limit during The War Within Season One.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Conqueror: </strong>Attain a mythic+ Rating of at least 2000 during The War Within Season One—reward: The Tempered title.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Master</strong>: Attain a Mythic+ Rating of at least 2000 during The War Within Season One—reward: Diamond Mechsuit mount.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Hero:&nbsp;</strong>Attain a Mythic+ Rating of at least 2500 during The War Within Season One—reward: Luminous Nerubian Catalyst Stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you end The War Within Season 1 with a Mythic+ Rating in the top 0.1% of all players in your region, you'll earn the Tempered Hero title.</p>
<h2>Keystone Affixes in The War Within Season 1</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Keystone Affixes are certain attacks or debuffs that provide an extra challenge to the Mythic+ dungeon. The new affixes will be seen as Mythic+ Keystone level 2, where players will see one of the Xal'atath-specific affixes, which are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Ascendant</strong>: Every minute, Xal'atath will summon 10 Orbs of Ascendance that cast Cosmic Ascension. Should the casts go off, the orbs will buff nearby mobs with +20% movement speed and Haste per orb. However, players are able to stop the cast via interruptions, displacement, crowd control, and purging them, which will instead give players a 2% movement speed and Haste buff per orb, which can stack up to a maximum of 20% movement speed and Haste per event.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Voidbound:&nbsp;</strong>While players are in combat, Xal'atath will summon a Void Emissary, who buffs nearby enemies with Dark Prayer. This will reduce the damage taken by 10% every three seconds, with the effect stacking. Once players have defeated the Void Emissary, players will be able to get a +20% ability cooldown rate and a +10% Critical Strike increase that lasts for 20 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Oblivion</strong>: While players are in combat, Xal'atath manifests crystals from the void that can either be absorbed by enemies or the players. Absorbing the crystals before they collide with enemies is advised, as it allows players to gain Void Essence, increasing Mastery and Leech. If the crystals hit the enemies, they will gain a +10% damage reduction per crystal.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Devour</strong>: Every so often, Xal'atath casts a Void Rift shield on all five players that can either be removed by healing or dispelling it. If you fail to remove the shield, it will heal nearby mobs for 10% of their health. Removing a shield will grant a stack of Lingering Void, which grants players +2% health and 4% Critical Strike.</p>
<p>Past Keystone Level 4, players will see Tyrannical or Fortified become active, with the affixes alternating each week. Tyrannical increases Dungeon bosses' health by 30% and damage by 15%. Fortified means non-boss enemies have 20% more health, and their damage increases by up to 20%.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 7, a new affix named Challenger's Peril becomes active. 15 seconds is subtracted from the dungeon timer each time a player dies instead of the usual 5-second subtraction.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 10, Fortified and Tyrannical become active at the same time. This means if you were seeing Tyrannical in one week, you might see Fortified instead once you reach Level 10.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 12, Xalatath's Bargain affixes are replaced with Xal'atath's Guile. This gives enemies a 20% increase in their health and damage, with players no longer receiving the buffs from the Bargain affixes.</p>
<p>This Mythic+ season is shaping up to be very difficult, with players having to be more careful in who they choose to create a Mythic+ team.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-switching-to-two-expansions-and-four-free-updates-per-year.975990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced radical changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>expansions and updates will be released, and the studio is moving away from its yearly release model going forward.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article titled "New Frontiers"</a>, Bungie marks the tenth anniversary of the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>franchise by discussing what's next for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. The studio said that it "closed a door" with recent expansion&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, and that it's now looking to open "a new one, a weird one, an exciting one".</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>will now get two "medium"-sized expansions per year, as well as four major free updates. The expansions will be paid, but the updates will be available for all players at no cost.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-expansions-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=hYS1nTeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-expansions-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=G7gdNdUO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>expansion "closed a door" for Bungie.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Destiny 2</em>'s new expansions will "depart from the one-shot campaign structure" for which the game's expansions have become known, and will instead experiment with uncharted territory for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. This could include "exploration experiences", Metroidvania structures, or even "roguelikes or survival shooters".</p>
<p>Additionally, rather than Episodes,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>will now get four updates per year. Expansions will launch alongside major updates at the start of Seasons, and a second update will follow three months after that, adding content like Strikes, new modes, and new gear.</p>
<p>This new modernization process begins with the expansion currently titled&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo</em>, which is set to launch next summer. Bungie describes this expansion as a "nonlinear character-driven adventure".</p>
<p>In essence, whereas the story in previous expansions was an "A to B to C to D" affair, this one will offer more choice, allowing you to explore locations and narrative elements at your own discretion (although the ones you don't pick will still be available later).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-codename-apollo.jpg?itok=wbU0DyHS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-codename-apollo.jpg?itok=6GmermET 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't quite know what&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo&nbsp;</em>is yet, but it'll be nonlinear.</figcaption></figure><p>These changes come after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">sweeping layoffs at Bungie</a>, which CEO Pete Parsons called part of a "new path" for the studio. It's also worth noting that the game's most recent major expansion,&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-officially-delayed-to-deliver-even-bigger-and-bolder">was delayed by several months</a>, which may be relevant in Bungie's decision to shift to smaller expansions.</p>
<p>We'll likely get to find out more about Bungie's plans for&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>in the coming months. Stay tuned for more on this as and when we get it.</p>

At the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531">when reflecting on how it had made me feel nostalgic</a></span> for a console that played no significant part in my past, I wrote, “I desperately wish for Sony’s Asobi Team to be freed of creating promotional minis and set loose on a full-length game.” My wish came true, and I—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">and everyone else</a></span>—am utterly bowled away by the sheer magnificence of what has been created.</p><p>But one moment stuck out from an already outstanding game: a level titled Downsize Surprise. It appears in the second galaxy of the game, the Tentacle System, and features a gimmick that—while glimpsed elsewhere in the game—is primarily used for this single level. You shrink and grow.</p><p>This is <em>by</em>&nbsp;<em>no means</em> an original idea. Games have been built around the conceit of shrinking and growing since games were a thing, entire <em>Zelda</em> games have been built around it, and it has of course been a core conceit of so many 2D <em>Mario</em> games that it might seem farcical to highlight here as something so very special. But highlight it I’m gonna, and if you’ve played the <em>Astro Bot</em> level, you’ll know why.</p><figure id="" data-id="e213152399d1528c9b513ab6a83f9fab" data-recommend-id="image://e213152399d1528c9b513ab6a83f9fab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro poses behind a cheese carboard cutout, surrounded by hungry-looking mice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro poses behind a cheese carboard cutout, surrounded by hungry-looking mice." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e213152399d1528c9b513ab6a83f9fab" data-recommend-id="image://e213152399d1528c9b513ab6a83f9fab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro poses behind a cheese carboard cutout, surrounded by hungry-looking mice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each <em>Astro Bot</em> level introduces a unique mechanic that exists just to delight you within that brief section of the game. Perhaps you’ll get a monkey friend who can climb walls and lift heavy objects with his giant hands. Or it might be froggy gloves that give you an uber-punch. Another time it could be an elephant backpack that can suck up liquid and then spawn platforms in midair. And in Downsize Surprise, it’s a mouse suit that lets you shrink down all teeny.<br></p><p>Thing is, in any other platform game that did this, you’d just shrink down for the level and then explore things in your miniature mode. But in <em>Astro Bot</em>’s level, the entire thing can be played at either size, requiring a combination of the two to complete, and you can switch form at any time you like.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate how complex that is from a level design perspective. Ordinarily, such a gimmick would allow the player to step through a portal, or trigger a change, at predetermined points. To let me, buffoon that I am, just hammer the size change button as often as I want to see what happens—that’s phenomenal. And to make it even better, the transformation feels <em>utterly magical</em>.</p><p>Like in those excellent scenes in the <em>Ant-Man</em> movies when Scott Lang has got the hang of the suit, hitting the button in mid-action and shrinking or growing accordingly never gets old. That flowerbed you were just stomping over is now an obstacle course of leaves and petals to explore. The little wooden trunk you stepped on is now a tunnel you can run through with pick-ups to collect. And then, because you can’t resist the idea, you press the grow button while you’re in the tunnel, and—YES!—it bursts apart and reveals even more goodies to pick up.</p><p>You use the ability in a few other ways I don’t want to mention, because finding them is so much of the joy. I’m more here today to celebrate the absolute beauty of how it’s delivered.</p><figure id="" data-id="a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-recommend-id="image://a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-recommend-id="image://a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s no question at all that <em>Astro Bot</em> leaves this mechanic under-explored. It’s no wonder, given that moments later you’re in Go Go Archipelago with a robo-monkey helping you throw stones at baddies and climb banana-grips up walls to reach twirly-whirly bars that fling you into the sky. If anything, the nonchalance with which Team Asobi utilizes a shrink/grow mechanic better than any game before it is all the more astonishing. “Yeah, we’ve perfected that, but we’re busy and have a great idea about balloons...”<br></p><p>Which brings me back to my provocative opening thesis. Nintendo, you’re being called out here.</p><p>Obviously there’s a new 3D <em>Mario</em> in development, perhaps intended to be released as a launch title for the Switch’s follow-up console next March. It’s been an astonishing seven years since <em>Odyssey</em> was released, and over three years since the prototype for a glorious open-world future, <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, was tucked in with the Switch release of <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>. So it’s probably too late for me to use my considerable influence to command Nintendo over what to include in the next 3D entry. But in the game after that, Nintendo, you need to return to the concept of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/k2oAwTAzmnU?si=PgPU7z1cLb0Sryen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/k2oAwTAzmnU?si=PgPU7z1cLb0Sryen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>'s Giant Land</a></span>, but in 3D, and it needs to be constantly innovating on the concept throughout. Got it? Great.</p><figure id="" data-id="9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-recommend-id="image://9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-recommend-id="image://9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If nothing else, let this missive implore you to play <em>Astro Bot</em>. I was fairly horrified when I saw that Sony is pricing it the same as a AAA 50 hour game, because cutesy 3D platformers are a hard sell at $60. And while I still believe it’d sell far more than twice as many copies at half the price, I can also assure you that the sheer concentrated joy within out-values any number of looter shooters or zombie-fests.<br></p><p>A single level has me thinking Nintendo developers might be wriggling uncomfortably in their seats, realizing that there’s finally some competition out there, another developer capable of cutting a slice from their enormous, delicious pie. And that’s pretty special.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-reveals-%E2%80%98codename-frontiers%E2%80%99-expansions-for-destiny-2.975981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-2-codename-frontiers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie has posted a roadmap outlining something called ‘Codename Frontiers’, an ambitious expansion plan for Destiny 2. It arrives on the tenth anniversary of Destiny, which was released in 2014 to an overwhelmingly positive reception. On June 4, Bungie released The Final Shape for Destiny 2, but it has now been revealed that it wasn’t ever set to mark the end of the game.</p>



<p>In the words of the team, ‘We closed a door with The Final Shape, but we are opening a new one, a weird one, an exciting one.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-apollo-and-behemoth">Apollo and Behemoth</h2>



<p>Bungie has revealed that in the summer of 2025, ‘Codename Apollo’ will be released in Destiny 2. It’ll be followed up in the winter by Codename Behemoth, another super-sized expansion. Outside of these expansions, players will pick up four major updates per year <strong>for free</strong> in Destiny 2.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Each expansion under the Codename Frontiers banner will accommodate two rewards passes, and the roadmap itself stretches to Spring 2026. Each season (Apollo and Behemoth) will be comprised of new stories, locations, missions, gear, and raids – amongst other things. </p>



<p>Speaking on the new plans, Bungie’s Tyson Green, the Game Director working on Destiny 2, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that it has become too rigid. Expansions have started to feel too formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value. Seasons and Episodes keep getting bigger but can still feel like you are just going through the motions.</p>



<p>We believe it’s time for Destiny to change and evolve, and that our community wants this game to grow and innovate too. And to do that, we need to start breaking some of the molds.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Bungie is also working on the approachability mechanics in Destiny 2, making it much more accessible to newcomers who might otherwise be put off by the game’s complexities.</p>



<p>Everything will kick off with Codename Apollo, which has been labelled a ‘<strong>nonlinear character-driven adventure</strong>.’</p>



<p>It’s a bold play by Bungie, and it looks solid on the surface – it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>

The celebrations kick off with a wardrobe raid, as players can grab a set of armor for each class inspired by the original concept armor pieces for Destiny. These were some of the first Destiny armor sets ever seen publicly, and they can be obtained when exploring the surroundings of the old Tower in The Pale Heart.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363997" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363997"></a><figcaption>Detiny 2014 armor sets are the new black.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363998,1300-4363999" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg"></figure><p>The other big celebratory pursuit will be a new selection of tasks that can be completed to earn the Legend title and seal. Some of the challenges involve completing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a> campaign on Legend difficulty, but if you've already done that, that task will automatically be checked off of your to-do list. There's one very good reason to chase after the Legend title, as earning it before Episode: Echoes ends will give players an early-access opportunity to purchase the Nerf version of the Ace of Spades hand cannon replica before its official launch in October. The offer includes a special Ace of Spades Nerf in-game weapon ornament that will also be available for purchase in the in-game store when Episode: Revenant launches.</p><p>Bungie also teased the return of a fan-favorite Exotic sniper rifle, Icebreaker, in an upcoming Dungeon release. The original Icebreaker was nasty to be on the receiving end of, as it turned anyone hit by its rounds into a walking bomb, but it had an interesting quirk as well. Icebreaker featured self-replenishing ammunition, and when fully upgraded, it had a chance to return ammo directly to the magazine on a successful hit. While it couldn't be reloaded like a standard weapon could, it was still cool to have a sniper rifle with essentially infinite ammo available.</p><p>Bungie says it has more Anniversary tributes to Destiny yet to reveal, and beyond the milestone celebrations, the studio also laid out its plans for Year 11 and beyond of Destiny 2, including four major updates every year, two smaller expansions twice a year, and the start of the next multi-year story saga in Codename: Apollo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/09/a-playstation-technical-presentation-is-happening-tomorrow-ps5-pro/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Without actually saying it exists, Sony have announced that the PS5 Pro will be revealed tomorrow, September 10th at 8:00am PT / 4:00pm BST. What the have announced is a “technical presentation” for the PlayStation 5, and as we already know what is inside the PS5&nbsp; there’s only one thing this could be.</p>
<p>“The 9-minute Technical Presentation will focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology”, explains the PS Blog. That’s it, that’s all we’re getting from Sony even though they already<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/06/ps5-pro-first-official-image-sony/"> leaked the console design</a> themselves.&nbsp; The announcement was also leaked, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/ps5-pro-design-and-announcement-plans-leaked/">we knew this was coming</a> in the first half of September.</p>



<p>As for what is inside the upgraded console, here’s what has leaked/rumoured so far:</p>
<p>he PS5 Pro will follow in the footsteps of the PS4 Pro in offering a general spec bump when compared to the base PS5, aiming to give a general uplift to both performance and game fidelity. There will be a 28% boost in system memory speed, a 10% increase in CPU speed, and then a huge jump in GPU speed by some 45% with custom hardware dedicated to image upscaling.</p>

<p>On the CPU side of things, this will be achieved with a High CPU Frequency Mode which allows it to hit 3.85Ghz, though this will be done by way of the dynamic power management that balances CPU and GPU power to reach the same power consumption. When in higher CPU modes, the GPU will be downclocked by 1.5%.</p>
<p>The system memory will jump from 448 GB/s to 576GB/s throughput, though newer memory types could see that figure jump further. Faster memory can have a big impact on the GPU performance, though it may be a bit disappointing that there’s no increase in memory from 16GB, which could potentially constrain the use of some more advanced ray tracing and other techniques.</p>
<p>There’s also a higher clock speed for the audio processing, which will allow for more complex reverbs to be processed with 35% more performance.</p>
<p>What does that all mean to the layman? Slightly better puddles? Nicer lighting? Something tangible worth buying a new console for which will no doubt cost even more than a standard PS5? We shall have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The stream will be broadcast in English on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/PlayStation">PlayStation YouTube channel</a> September 10yh at 8:00am PT / 11:00am ET / 4:00pm BST.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-technical-presentation-ps5-pro-possible-reveal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a PS5 "Technical Presentation" hosted by none other than lead PS5 architect Mark Cerny, and it's scheduled to air tomorrow.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony says that the presentation will take place tomorrow at 8am Pacific (that's around 11am Eastern and about 4pm BST). You'll be able to watch the show via the official PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2Y8dQb0S6DtpxNgAKoJKA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment communications director Sid Shuman says the presentation will last around nine minutes, and that it'll "focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology". While the company is cagey regarding further details, we can make a few educated guesses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-technical-presentation-banner.jpg?itok=MMT7PCQ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-technical-presentation-banner.jpg?itok=eXAgKjUw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big things could be coming for PlayStation.</figcaption></figure><p>Within the last few weeks, the rumor mill has been spinning particularly fast concerning a potential upcoming reveal of the PS5 Pro, which has been mooted for some time now.</p>
<p>In late August, noted leaker Bilibil-kun, via <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" rel="noopener" target="_blank">French platform Dealabs</a>, supposedly revealed a sketch of the PS5 Pro, which showed a console that looks pretty similar to the current Slim model of the machine, only with some extra detailing and ports.</p>
<p>There was, of course, also the supposed PS5 Pro spec leak in March, behind which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN put its weight</a>, and just a couple of days ago, the ever-reliable Wario64 <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1831772340218425426" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that the PS5 Pro's design appears to be visible in a new PlayStation image celebrating the brand's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>All told, it's looking pretty likely that we're going to get some kind of PS5 Pro reveal during tomorrow's showcase, although obviously, we can't confirm that with any degree of certainty until the presentation itself has taken place.</p>

<p>Given that this year does indeed mark PlayStation's 30th birthday, it would seem a rather appropriate year to announce the PS5 Pro, and doing so would certainly inject a little faith into a brand that has arguably been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">struggling a little</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">recent times</a> (<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>notwithstanding).</p>
<p>In any case, we'll find out exactly what Sony is planning to announce tomorrow at 11am Eastern, so join us then for all the announcements from the Technical Presentation as soon as we get them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/boku-no-natsuyasumi-ps1-playstation-summer-vacation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello. I am here to apologise. For years, dating back to the first time I wrote about it on the Old Site (in 2014!), I have been describing the <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi </em>series as variations of "relaxing", and even "chill". If you have ever played the games based on those recommendations, I would like to apologise for doing you dirty.</p><p>Sure, the games <em>look </em>chill. Their back-of-the-box summary certainly fits the bill. In each you play a kid on summer vacation, free to roam the countryside doing all kinds of fun kid stuff. Maybe you do some fishing, maybe you go for a swim, maybe you battle some bugs–you're a kid, you don't have a care in the world! Video games couldn't be any more relaxing!</p><p><strong>WRONG</strong>. As I have found<a href="https://aftermath.site/it-is-time-to-play-boku-no-natsuyasumi-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> after finally playing one to completion instead of just wildly dabbling</a>, this is a series defined by tension. No matter what you want to do, how leisurely your pursuits may appear, you are never really free to "chill" in <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>. You are simply performing tasks inside the brief window between one school year and the next, and all the while the latter is hurtling toward you as grimly and inevitably as Terminus in <em>Majora's Mask</em>.</p><p>There is no <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi </em>without a calendar, and the way you're methodically marched through it, one pastime to the next, one day at a time. It doesn't matter how hard you relax, or even what you do with the time given to you, because once you arrive at your summer home and the game begins, you've got 30 days. After that, it's all over.</p><p>This broad structure leads, as Tim has covered so well in his sprawling series on the game, to an urge to optimise your vacation. When the first game provides multiple endings based on the choices you make, and some activities open up only if you've performed certain actions at certain times, the stage is set for players to try to earn the "best" version of a holiday, one that creates the most lasting and consequential memories possible.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="action button reviews boku no natsuyasumi" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/779coR-XPTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That's not really a holiday, is it? Or even relaxing. It's just more work. You get up in the morning, you get dressed, do some stuff on a schedule, get rewards for it then go to bed. Rise and shine, rinse and repeat, do it all over again. Please note I'm not criticising the games here; this is the most relatable thing about them! We all know as we get older that a weekend isn't really a full weekend, and a vacation isn't really a whole vacation, because for every day of recreation there's an equal and opposite reaction: a day of dread.</p><p>A weekend isn't 2.5 days of fun. It's a Friday night, a whole day on Saturday to do stuff then a whole other day of laundry, washing dishes, recovering from Saturday and just generally wincing at the realisation that you're closer to going back to work than you are to Friday night. Same goes for vacations, and that's how I end up playing <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>, and I hate it.</p><p>In the spirit of <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi's</em> childhood reminiscence, I remember being a kid and feeling the same way about summer holidays. The first week or two would pass in a blur of delirium, freedom and escape, but as the heat dragged on and the days on the calendar whirred by, things would take on a different shape. Parties and beach trips gave way to trips to buy new school shoes, and whenever a holiday season passed its midway point I'd start to feel the weight of the upcoming school year resting a little heavier on my shoulders each day.</p><p>Maybe if <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em> were some sprawling sandbox, one taking place in a land free of day or date, it'd feel different. But it very much <em>does </em>take note of day and date, that's the whole point of the series. Your vacation is for a strictly limited time, so make the most of it!</p><p>I'll allow that some of this dread might be down to me, someone who can only enjoy a vacation for a certain amount of time before the threat of future work outmuscles my enjoyment of the present. But I also think much of it is intentional, for both game design and cultural reasons, and that as a result a series renowned as being "chill" actually has one of the most foreboding and inescapable boss fights of all time: going back to school.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back to School </a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-back-to-school-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Do you feel that chill in the air? The crunch of red and yellow leaves as you step out into the rapidly-dimming daylight? Me neither. Climate change has ruined everything, and fall doesn’t start until November now. But! School is nonetheless back in session, so it’s time for Aftermath’s second-ever theme week. We hope you’ll join us for the festivities.</p><p>Back To School Week, the second of what he hope will become seasonal theme weeks following <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/inside-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside Baseball Week earlier this year</a>, is partially about school as it’s depicted in games – I mean, who doesn’t love <em>Persona </em>– but on top of that, we’re expanding the scope to include growth and education more generally, as well as ideas like nostalgia, youth, and hard lessons learned by companies and game developers alike. It’s been <a href="https://aftermath.site/axis-studios-collapse-closed-layoffs-vfx-animation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year of sobering realizations for everyone</a> in the video game industry, and we want to provide an unflinching look into how that’s impacted the people responsible for the games and services you love. But also, Chris is really excited to show people all the cool school/office/diary-worthy pens he’s been testing out, so we’re gonna do that too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve got tons of stories planned, and you’ll be able to find them all <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Back To School Week also ties into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our subscriber goals for this year</a>. In short, we’re a worker-owned, <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reader-supported</a> operation. We despise the idea of greedy executives and out-of-touch bosses turning what we’ve created into another <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enshittified shell</a> of a once-good website, and we’ve decided to avoid that at all costs. So far, readers’ contributions have allowed us to start running freelance pieces – some <a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damn</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ones</a>, we think – and lay the groundwork for a merch store, which will be open for business very soon. We are immensely thankful. A little over a year ago, we were disparately roving writers, scattered to the winds by cruel circumstance. Now we’re all able to work together again, and we have a functional business that we own. It remains absolutely surreal to think about. We couldn’t have done any of this without our readers. We owe you the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But though your support has transformed this Little Site That Could into a Little Site That Can And Is Doing Some Really Cool Shit, we still dream of accomplishing even more: turning Aftermath into a full-time job for everyone on staff, bringing aboard another person or two, launching another podcast, and of course, throwing a big party to which you will all be invited.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you’re not already a subscriber, consider <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sending a few bucks our way</a> so that you, too, can read as many articles as you want, comment on them, and join our Discord community (which absolutely rules, by the way). We also have <a href="https://aftermath.site/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tip jar</a> where you can donate any amount you want, if that’s more your speed. Consider it tuition to ensure that the beautiful institution of Aftermath University remains alive and thriving. If you kick in enough, we might even name a hall after you.*</p><p>*A hallway, in one of our apartments</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One big question, however, is what the new machine will cost. The existing PS5 still hasn’t received a price cut four years into its life, fueling speculation that a PS5 Pro might be $600 or more, even without a disc drive attached.</p><p>It’s possible this week’s tech presentation won’t be about the new hardware at all, though. Fans have also been waiting to hear more about the PS5's backwards compatibility improvements&nbsp;as well as new game streaming capabilities that go beyond remote play.

<p>While Sony didn’t say what the presentation is for, all signs are pointing to the PS5 Pro being revealed. Reports have continued that it would be revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some point in September</a> with a release for the 2024 Holiday season. Just last week the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-will-have-a-similar-design-to-the-slim-models-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">design of the system was leaked</a>, and the system <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was also teased</a> in PlayStation’s own advertising.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first to report of the console’s existence</a> back in March 2023.</p>



<p>As far as what the PS5 Pro will feature, various specs have been leaked and rumored over the last few months. According to the rumors, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console will have an identical CPU</a> to the PS5 but with a “High CPU Frequency Mode” to boost performance along with a CPU that offers 45% faster rendering than the current PS5.</p>

                <p>Since its official launch in 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/six-roblox-horror-games-to-try-out-this-halloween/2900-4416/" data-ref-id="2900-4416">Roblox</a> has amassed 79.5 million daily active users around the world. And in 2023, the Roblox Corporation revealed its grand ambition to increase that number to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-corp-eyeing-1-billion-daily-players/1100-6516723/" data-ref-id="1100-6516723">1 billion daily active users</a>. At this year's Roblox Developers Conference, the company announced some new plans to reach that goal, including a partnership between Roblox and Shopify as well as revamped revenue-sharing plans for developers who make premium experiences for the game creation platform.</p><p>Via <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Roblox site</a>, the company's deal with Shopify is part of a broader push to allow creators to sell their own physical merchandise within the experiences that they make for Roblox. Essentially, this means players won't have to leave Roblox if they want to buy something from one of their favorite creators. The Roblox Corporation notes that there will also be integrated support for other e-commerce platforms alongside Shopify. These features will be added in early 2025, but a few select creators may participate in the pilot program later this year.</p><p>The Roblox Corporation is also adding higher revenue sharing plans for creators who make premium experiences for Roblox on desktop. Experiences charging $10, $30, and $50 will respectively earn 50%, 60%, and 70% of the revenue for their creators beginning later this year. Support for games/experiences created for other platforms will happen at some point down the line.</p><p>Additionally, Roblox Corporation has signaled that it is working towards giving creators the tools and support they need to make "a high-performance, 100-player open-world, sports or battle royale-type game on Roblox." While Roblox co-creator David Baszucki appeared to concede that the platform can't currently support that, he also said "we won’t stop until this is possible."</p><p>Some of the other new features include Roblox Party, which allows friends to play the same games together. Roblox is also partnering with music distributer DistroKid to bring its catalog of music to the platform. There will be a new features called What's Playing and Music Charts. The former allows users to identify any piece of music playing in Roblox, while the latter will host separate charts for game/experience music and songs. Music Charts is expected to launch on Roblox early next year.</p>

The console is reportedly codenamed Trinity, and will feature a more powerful GPU and CPU.</p>

<p>Will we finally get a look at the long-rumoured PS5 Pro model?

Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">PS5 Pro technical specs</a> have appeared online, which Eurogamer understands to be accurate, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">Digital Foundry analysis dubbed the PS5 Pro "the most powerful console yet"</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in PlayStation-related news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-increases-price-of-playstation-5-dualsense-controller">Sony has quietly increased the price of a DualSense controller</a>.

			<p>We’re living through a veritable golden age of fighting games right now. It feels like you can’t go more than a couple of months without a new feature-rich, mechanically dense and utterly addicting fighter coming out, and with the hefty amount of DLC support modern fighting games get, even the ones that are a bit long in the tooth still feel fresh years after release. There’s a new wave of gamers taking to these games and entrenching themselves in the fighting game community (FGC). Despite flourishing modern releases, though, so many of the older iconic staples haven’t been easily playable or accessible in ages. Enter Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics to right some of these wrongs.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection Title Showcase Trailer: MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjgLcjbytGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is arguably the game that kicked off the culture and energy that we’ve associated with the FGC for so long. Now, thanks to Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, everyone and anyone can be taken for a ride in this all-time classic – as well as play the six other games that helped form the history and backbone that would ultimately lead to this all-star fighting game’s birth.</p>


<p>I can’t imagine there’s an equal amount of fever and hype around all of the games in this collection. Obviously, the star of the show is Marvel vs. Capcom 2 – the 3v3 crossover fighter from 2000 that is pretty undeniably one of the best fighting games of all time for multiple reasons and across numerous categories. It’s a game full of boisterous style and campy, flashy vibes that you can’t help but smile at. Sure, back when it first came out, people hated the soundtrack so much that you couldn’t go to a single FGC meetup without seeing someone rocking a custom MvC2 mixtape full of Ricky Martin and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony tracks. Nowadays, there’s as much of a charm to the goofy character-select music as there is to the beautifully rendered character portraits, the overwhelming stage animations, and the feverishly fluid sprite animations.</p>

<p>What I had never a strong finger on until now, though, was just how many games Capcom made as part of their partnership with Marvel, which ultimately brought them to the iconic character-stuffed tag fighter we all know and love. MvC2 is actually the fourth game in a series of Capcom x Marvel crossover fighters – and there were two Marvel-only fighting games based on Street Fighter 2 that came before that. Plus a Punisher beat-em-up!</p>

<p>All of those games make up this collection, and I wish the game itself did a better job of presenting that history and chronology. In-game, none of these titles get blurbs or descriptions explaining their historical context – you can’t even see what year they were released. I had a sneaking suspicion that X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes were made during the Street Fighter 2 era, but I couldn’t confirm that theory until I went to the official website for this compilation.</p>
<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics isn’t entirely lacking in archival-focused features, though. There’s a Museum mode that provides dedicated art galleries and music players for each game in the pack. The art galleries are astounding, providing not just high-quality scans of every playable character portrait, but even arcade-ending sketches, design document pages, stage concepts, original arcade marquee images, and more. There should be a more structured way to sift through all of these, though – each image is numbered and vaguely titled, but you need to scroll through each one manually in full-screen. The music player is a little more robust, although you can’t customise any of the music played within the actual games.</p>

<p>Each entry in the pack has also been updated to be the most feature-rich version of each game. Every hidden character and unlockable/secret color palette is available, but you can decide to disable them or require their original unlock requirements if you so choose. Part of me wishes the game did a better job at providing documentation on how to access some of these secrets or what they specifically are, but it’s also kind of fun that you get to emulate that old-school vibe of frantically asking friends <em>“Is Akuma in Marvel Super Heroes???”</em> to seek the truth.</p>
<p>Each game also provides a new training-mode, letting you freely select your characters and stage on top of enabling access to frame data and extensive training CPU options. For a game like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, it’s a game-changer that makes competitive play more accessible than ever. And when you’re ready to compete, each game offers casual, lobby, and ranked online play for you to test your skills.</p>

<p>I’m honestly blown away by this release – in an era where Capcom has been pushing so many of their legacy franchises forward with high-budget, modernised sequels and follow-ups, seeing them concurrently respect their past and make it all so accessible is a standard that I wish every game publisher of their scale would follow. For this pack to not only exist, but be as feature-rich as it is, makes my heart soar.</p>

			<p>The wait is finally over. The PlayStation 5 Pro is getting revealed tomorrow in a new technical presentation hosted by March Cerny.</p>
<p>The technical presentation, which will be around 9 minutes long, will be <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1833158510030516386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1833158510030516386%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streamed</a> tomorrow, September 10th, at 8:00 a.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. CET. While the announcement makes no mention of the PlayStation 5 Pro, the presentation will undoubtedly focus on Sony's long-rumored hardware refresh.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro reveal finally happening this week is not surprising for all those who have been following all the rumors regarding the soon-to-be-announced system, as a well-known insider proved to be correct once again by confirming that the reveal would be happening <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-announced-state-of-play/">early this week.</a> The fact that the reveal was also around the corner was essentially confirmed by another well-known insider who managed to get an early look at the system's packaging late last month, providing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">sketch</a> that confirmed how the new system's design won't be that much different from that of the base model.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is said to be a considerable step up from the base model. It features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/">45% more powerful GPU</a> compared to the base model, which will offer up to 4x ray tracing performance. In addition, the console will support the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will make the system feel <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-100-faster-upscaling-epic-settings/">100% faster than the base model.</a></p>

						<h5>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</h5><p><span>September 12th, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S (2025)</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series is a fighting game franchise that needs to introduction. It was the culmination of a long collaboration between the two companies which began back in 1994 with X-Men: Children of the Atom and continued with Marvel Super Heroes the following year. With the release in 1996 of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, the world of fighting games changed forever, thanks to the game's tag system, which allowed players to swap between two different characters at almost any time during a fight and unleash super moves together, a system that was further refined in Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter, paving the way for the proper MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series in 1998. The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics celebrates this fruitful collaboration by including every game mentioned above alongside the side-scrolling beat'em up The Punisher and what many still consider the very best entry in the series, MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2: New Age of Heroes.</p>
<p>As every game included in the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics collection is not available on modern gaming platforms, even their barebones release would have been welcome. CAPCOM, however, went the extra mile and provided some additional goodies that die-hard fans of the series will appreciate, such as the artwork included in the Gallery, which lets them delve deeper into the history of the franchise and its creation and the ability to listen to the entirety of the soundtrack of each game. Each title also sports its marquee card, including the basic controls for each game, for an authentic recreation of the arcade experience. Those who prefer a more modern touch can bring up the command list in any game to learn every unique normal and special move their characters can perform.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240905233150_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like in previous CAPCOM fighting game collections, such as the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/capcom-fighting-collection-you-must-defeat-sheng-long-to-stand-a-chance/">Fighting Collection</a>, the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics lets players pick which version of the game they want to play, set the difficulty, attack power and timer speed, unlock secret characters and colors and so on. Every game also features a training mode that covers all basics, with the exception of frame data, different wallpapers, display filters, and the ability to change the display size between different options. As such, when it comes to new options and additions, the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics definitely does things right.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same hasn't happened with online play. Due to the limited player population during the review period, I wasn't able to find a single online match in any of the games, so the review will be updated once the collection is officially released and more players are around. Even like this, however, I have no doubt that, at least on PC, online play will be far from being optimal due to the lack of cross-platform play, which feels like a major oversight. Many of these games, MARVEL vs CAPCOM 2 above all, aren't exactly dead games on PC, thanks to Fightcade, which allowed the communities of many classic fighting games to continue enjoying them online with an excellent implementation of rollback netcode. As such, I really don't see many of the players who already play these games daily on Fightcade make the switch, as the ranking system, which employs the same League system seen in Street Fighter V and<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"> Street Fighter 6</a>, is not a very good incentive to do so. On consoles, on the other hand, I expect things to be slightly different, given there's no other way to play these games, either offline or online. Even so, the lack of cross-platform play is a major issue that will inevitably impact the popularity of the collection in the long term, diminishing the collection's appeal. Speaking on PC, the collection also has a small issue that prevents the correct saving of resolution settings upon quitting, which is, honestly, a minor problem, given that these settings only affect the menus.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240905235755_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter the online play issues, if you have never played any of the games in the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics and are a fighting game fan, you are in for a threat. While the games have aged differently, and some of them don't feel as good to play in 2024 as they did back when they were released, X-Men: Children of the Atom chief among them, they can still be a ton of fun. Having been developed back when CAPCOM was working on the Street Fighter Alpha series, all of the Marvel licensed games in the collection, with the exception of The Punisher, share a lot of similarities with the series, such as the anime aesthetics, the flashy super moves, the ability to block attacks in the air and so on. Things started going wild with MARVEL Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, which expanded the tag system introduced in X-Men vs Street Fighter with the introduction of assist attacks that opened up some new combo possibilities, culminating in MARVEL vs CAPCOM 2: New Age of Heroes.</p>
<p>The second entry in the series is undeniably the best game included in the collection, thanks to its massive character roster including 56 characters, the three-character teams, the ability to pick between three different Assist Types, the unique visuals combining masterfully designed sprites and 3D backgrounds and the amazing soundtrack. While the game retains many of the features that made the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM tag fighting games unique, such as the flashy moves and combo system, which allow players to chain together normals of increasing strength and perform aerial combos that often lead to touch of death situations and infinite, it's also the game that plays the most differently, as the traditional six-button control scheme of CAPCOM's fighting games was changed to allow for quicker access to assist attacks, which are more important than in any other game that came before it. Needless to say, it's the game that aged best and feels as great to play now as it did 24 years ago.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240906000030_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Among the games included in MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, The Punisher is the one that stands out the most, as it is, as already mentioned, a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Final Fight and Captain Commando. While fun for a short while, the game is obviously very dated for today's standards and gets a little repetitive after a short while, mostly due to the game featuring a single playable character since both The Punisher himself, Frank Castle, and Nick Fury have the same moveset, but its inclusion in the collection is wholly deserved, given its cult status and its popularity in arcades back in 1993.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, despite the lack of cross-platform play that is inevitably going to impact the collection's popularity, the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a worthwhile purchase for most fighting games players, especially if they are console players. All the included games play like their arcade counterparts, and the fact alone that CAPCOM released it confirms the publisher hasn't abandoned the series after the disastrous Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite. The release of a proper fourth entry in the series is not a guarantee, but for the time being, the community can finally say the sentence it has wanted to say for a long time: Mahvel's back!</p>

<p>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-review-babyface-enthusiasm.975876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-review-babyface-enthusiasm<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve periodically been a defender of the movie or TV show tie-in game experience. As someone whose younger years were largely dedicated to playing the Game Boy Advance version of <em>Monsters Inc. </em>whenever my 7-year-old brain got confused by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/wheres-wario-unrealized-potential-of-wario-land"><em>Wario Land</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metroid-samus-returns-review-in-her-prime"><em>Metroid 2: Return of Samus</em></a>, I understand and respect their place in the gaming atmosphere. It’s by that extension I look at <em>Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland</em> with a hopeful smile.</p>
<p>This is the latest release from developers Wallride Games, developed in collaboration with Media Indie Exchange (Stylized as The MIX Games), and is an all-new story in the <em>Rugrats </em>universe. After Tommy, Chuckie, Phil &amp; Lil watch an advert for a new Reptar game on the TV, through the power of imagination, they transform the house into a video game they can play themselves. Together, they collect coins and defeat familiar foes from the TV show in order to finally face Reptar.</p>
<p>There’s a certain vision <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> presents from the get-go, and indeed, even with its marketing. It’s not just aiming to be a nostalgic return to form for one of Nickelodeon’s flagship shows, but also a return to simpler times, emulating the efforts of other movie and TV show tie-in titles. As such, the game aims to evoke nostalgia, whilst claiming to learn lessons from their predecessors.</p>

<p>Other titles in the fray would stick to being an honest-to-god platformer, left-to-right until you recreate the ending of whatever work it’s based on, but here? We’ve got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mega-man-11"><em>Mega Man</em></a> level structure that allows you to tackle stages whenever and however you want, and <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>-esque mechanics in regards to what the titular Rugrats can offer.</p>
<p>With that said, <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> actually has a one-up on <em>Mario Bros 2</em> by allowing you to swap characters during gameplay. As for how they play, it’s pretty much a 1:1 recreation of the <em>Doki Doki Panic</em> reskin - Tommy’s your Mario counterpart, Chuckie kicks his feet in the air for extra height and has trouble lifting objects up like Luigi, and Lil can float for a short time, not unlike Princess Peach.</p>
<p>There’s one small issue, however, and that’s telegraphing. There’s a hard mode on offer that disables being able to swap characters during gameplay, with your only option being that you choose one of the four babies before a level starts, and stick with them. If you chose someone like, say, Phil, who has the lowest jump out of all 4 Rugrats, there’s a good chance you can get stuck with some of the more frankly awful level design this game possesses.</p>

<p>The key is consistency, and <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> knows no concept of the word. The game can’t decide whether it wants to provide straightforward platforming challenges, or intricate maze-like designs where you’re running around headless looking for Reptar coins. Neither option provides many avenues for interesting or involving gameplay, as levels tend to end far too quickly for anything remotely engaging to come to fruition.</p>
<p>The controls are also awful, heavily delayed for you to make any action, which is made all the more fun once <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> starts introducing more pressing hazards. Conveyor belts and icy platforms can be an absolute nightmare to navigate due to how much momentum these babies need to build up before they can react appropriately to any dangers. It’s simply not fun to play, it’s more like a <em>Mega Man</em> fan game without intuition of what makes <em>Mega Man</em> so appropriately challenging.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that the visual design doesn’t want to cooperate with communicating hazards and objects.<em> Adventures in Gameland</em> offers 2 modes of graphic fidelity; HD and 8-bit. The latter is cute and well-executed alongside its sound design, which can range from warbly earworms to frenetic and unnecessary screeches. The HD option? Almost completely irredeemable.</p>

<p>This may be a nostalgia thing, but <em>Rugrats </em>as a show always felt approachable because of its animation style: squiggly and childish lining with that 90s color palette worked wonders on an old CRT TV, or even as a memory. Transplanting it to a 3D space, or HD in this instance, detracts so much of the magic from it to the point where I’d say <em>Adventures in Gameland </em>in its HD format is one of the most visually unappealing experiences I’ve had in a while.</p>
<p>It also detracts from the gameplay. When the HD filter is used, the screen zooms in far too much for you to be able to react appropriately to any threat or obstacle. It feels like a flash game from yesteryear, plastered on the front of a Nickelodeon website to be played once, and never again. Even then, it doesn’t feel formative to the experience, it’s not enough of an emulation of <em>Rugrats </em>to be meaningful, bar some quick references to stuff like “Angelica’s Worst Nightmare” and Reptar.</p>
<p>In its 8-bit format, the game is tolerable, but only just. Threats and actual navigation fail to be hampered, bar some rather awkward pathfinding the player has to commit to. Sometimes the screen wraps around, sometimes it doesn’t. A doorway may be accentuated as such, or sometimes you’ll have to find the right spot on the platform to appropriately transition.</p>

<p>These examples can be brought down to the handful, but given how little there is on display, a handful becomes half the plate. All of this to serve a game that doesn't feel like it appeals to any demographic, whether it's the young'ins looking to see what they missed out on with <em>Rugrats</em>, or the nostalgia-fueled adults who remember watching <em>Rugrats </em>as a kid. It's a truly bizarre artifact of befuddled intention.</p>
<h2><em>Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>When <em>Adventures in Gameland </em>says that it wants to be an emulation of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/shovelware-importance-games-industry">licensed game experience we all know and love</a>, or begrudgingly acknowledge, it’s easy to be sucked in given years of knowledge. Indeed, it takes some bold strides, but fails at nearly every conceivable angle, and spectacularly so. As a celebration, it passes the mark, but don’t let that fool you for this being a remotely fun time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activist-ubisoft-investor-calls-for-strategic-and-structural-change.975873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A company that serves as a "significant minority shareholder" in Ubisoft has called for major structural and strategic change at the studio and has expressed "deep dissatisfaction" with Ubisoft's current direction.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an open letter</a> to Ubisoft's board of directors, which CCs CEO Yves Guillemot and stakeholder Tencent, investment company AJ Investments criticizes Ubisoft's "current performance and strategic direction".</p>
<p>AJ Investments says Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-rainbow-six-mobile-and-the-division-resurgence-beyond-march-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent quarterly results</a>, which saw upcoming releases&nbsp;<em>The Division Resurgence&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Mobile&nbsp;</em>pushed back beyond March next year, have "heightened" its concerns about management's ability to deliver results for shareholders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-investors-letter-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=zB6lAOYP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-investors-letter-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=1_H6YRgh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>AJ Investments criticizes the launch of games like&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, which it says was "not a success".</figcaption></figure><p>The investor sets out four proposals to "increase [the] value of Ubisoft for all stakeholders". They include allowing Ubisoft to go private, selling the company, changing current management and ousting Guillemot as CEO, or starting a "proxy fight" via French minority law.</p>
<p>As for its reasoning, AJ Investors says that Ubisoft is being "mismanaged", and that shareholders are currently "hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantages of them".</p>
<p>The company goes on to say that it "cannot understand" Ubisoft's management strategy, and that the studio seems more focused on "pleasing investors" rather than providing an "exceptional experience" for its fans.</p>
<p>AJ Investors claims that many of the studio's IPs, including&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>,&nbsp;<em>Watch Dogs</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell</em>, are being underutilized, and that recent releases are underwhelming.</p>
<p>The company does, however, say that&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prince-of-persia-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>&nbsp;</em>was merely "okay", but that "nobody talks about the game anymore". That's...probably because it's a single-player game everyone's finished, guys. Not every game needs to be headline news every day of the week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-ubisoft.jpg?itok=n-mlEHuD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-ubisoft.jpg?itok=gHECorhP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>was merely "okay", according to AJ Investors.</figcaption></figure><p>Further on into the letter, AJ Investors proposes several ways by which Ubisoft could improve its performance and its standing with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They include taking the company private for a "fair price", as well as laying off staff, a procedure AJ Investors rather callously refers to as "optimiz[ing] staff levels". Other recommendations include refocusing on core IPs and another call for changes in management.</p>
<p>This letter comes after industry analyst Serkan Toto <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1830972799634284971" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out last week</a> that investors seem "very disappointed" about the sales of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, with shares dipping 10% in just two days. Toto followed this up with <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1833067702019313773" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another post today</a> noting that stocks had fallen another 9% in Paris.</p>
<p>AJ Investors does note that the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>Metacritic score currently sits at 76, a score the company says is "quite good in our view" (despite stating earlier that the game was "not 100% ready to release"). For what it's worth, our own reviewer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review">rather liked it as well</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see how Ubisoft responds to AJ Investors' call for change, if indeed it responds at all. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Hideo Kojima’s first post-<em>Metal Gear</em> game initially came out in 2019 and offers a unique sci-fi world where you navigate a vast postapocalyptic landscape to deliver packages to people. It may sound a bit boring, but the story takes you places (even if some of Kojima’s trappings often leave people a bit perplexed — and intrigued). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">Read our initial review</a>.</li><li>OnePlus is running various discounts <a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/916678/12532?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fphone">on its site</a>, and one of the standouts is the excellent <strong>OnePlus Open</strong> <a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/916678/12532?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-open%3Fsku%3D5011103225">selling for $1,299.99</a> ($400 off). The foldable phone comes with 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM and features a 6.3-inch outer screen and a 7.82-inch inner unfolding screen. Outside of the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which costs $1,800, OnePlus’ Open is one of the most “normal” feeling foldables you can get in the US — it doesn’t have that skinny TV remote feel when it’s closed.

The nine-minute stream will be hosted by Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS5 console. Cerny previously revealed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21183181/sony-ps5-playstation-5-specs-details-hardware-processor-8k-ray-tracing">full PS5 specs</a> ahead of its debut in 2020.</p><p>The stream will start at 8AM PT / 11AM ET / 4PM UK on September 10th and will be broadcast on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2FPlayStation">PlayStation YouTube</a> channel. Sony hasn’t provided any further details about the technical presentation, but the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/">announcement</a> comes just after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image">Sony teased the PS5 Pro</a> in a 30th anniversary PlayStation image. </p><p>A montage included a PS5 design that looks identical to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">PS5 Pro leak</a>&nbsp;from last month. Leaked images of the PS5 Pro showed a console with three black stripes in the middle of the outer facades, unlike the existing PS5 model that has a single stripe. Sony’s teaser image included a PS5 with those same three black stripes.</p><p>We’ve known for months the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">PS5 Pro is real</a>&nbsp;and that developers have been getting their games ready for this new console. I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image">recently heard</a> that developers need to make any games released on or after September 16th compatible with the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Codenamed Trinity, the PlayStation 5 Pro model will include a more powerful GPU and a slightly faster CPU mode, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">Sony documents seen by <em>The Verge</em></a>. The PS5 Pro hardware changes all point to a console that will be far more capable of hitting higher resolutions, improve frame rates in certain games, and improve support for ray tracing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Listening to it today you can imagine it hitting the perfect note (“Keep us from temptation”) in <em>GTA VI</em>’s Florida nightclub-fueled, modern-day Bonnie and Clyde romance tale. </p><p>But it doesn’t sound like the song will be in the game. “I was recently contacted by my publishers on behalf of Rockstar Games re the possibility of using ‘Temptation’ on the new <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>,” Ware <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/martynware/status/1832360363179868488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832360363179868488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> over the weekend.<em> “</em>Naturally excited about the immense wealth that was about to head my way, I scrolled to the bottom of the email re the offer…IT WAS $7500—for a buyout of any future royalties from the game - forever…”</p><p>Ware pointed out that the last game in the series, <em>Grand Theft Auto V </em>(which he misnamed <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>) has sold nearly 200 million copies and generated <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-grand-theft-auto-revenue-and-costs/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-grand-theft-auto-revenue-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than an estimated $8 billion</a></span> in revenue over the lifetime of the game. “Ah, but think of the exposure…” he added. “Go fuck yourself.” In recent years, the blockbuster open-world game, which ended up spanning three different console generations, has become a go-to example for debates about who deserves what when it comes to the lifetime sales success in a creative field where ongoing royalties and residuals for those involved is almost unheard of. Outside of bonuses, most of the upside for massive games is reserved for the companies that publish them.</p><p>Of course, the potential “exposure” that “Temptation” may have gotten as a result of its inclusion is nothing to sniff at.

Then again, “Temptation” would have been just one of tons of songs featured in the game, and it’s far from clear how much the buzz for Petty’s music actually translated into actual new record sales, or how that might trickle down to his estate after everyone else’s take. </p><p><em>GTA VI</em> is currently due out in the second half of next year on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.
