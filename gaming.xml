            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-child-safety-controls-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>will reportedly soon introduce new child safety controls aimed at stemming the tide of criticism aimed at Roblox Corporation over a perceived lack of protection for underage users on the platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/roblox-enacts-child-safety-changes-giving-parents-more-control?srnd=undefined" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Bloomberg report</a>&nbsp;(which cites an email from <em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>to parents), these controls include limiting certain chat features for users under 13 without parental permission, as well as requiring children under 9 to get permission to access games with "moderate violence or crude humor", as Bloomberg says.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>will supposedly be introducing a new kind of account that allows parents to monitor what their children do on&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, as well as who they're interacting with on the platform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-child-safety-controls-report-logo.jpg?itok=uuTaDJkU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-child-safety-controls-report-logo.jpg?itok=1gNs9uun 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>will soon introduce new parental controls, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement provided to Bloomberg by Roblox Corporation, the company said the changes were "part of&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>'s commitments to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users".</p>
<p>However, the spokesperson for Roblox Corporation didn't elaborate on the changes. It's likely we'll hear more from Roblox Corporation itself as we draw closer to the official reveal for the changes, which we're likely to see next month, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>These changes follow in the wake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-report-pedophile-hellscape-lying-investors">a damning report</a> released by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, in which the company refers to&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>as an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" in which some groups openly trade child pornography and solicit sexual favors.</p>
<p>The report also found that moderators have a "limited ability" to remove perpetrators and keep them away from&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, and that moderation for the platform is "largely outsourced to Asian call centers" at which moderators are paid "$12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-child-safety-controls-report-classic.jpg?itok=sOpzed9P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-child-safety-controls-report-classic.jpg?itok=F7JGDrJA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>came under fire earlier this month in a damning report by Hindenburg Research.</figcaption></figure><p>The upcoming changes also come against a backdrop of&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-financials-trust-safety-spending">reducing its trust and safety spending</a> back in August, a move that some called into question considering mounting concerns about child safety within&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>communities.</p>
<p>Whether or not these child safety controls do anything to improve things for&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen; we'll have to wait and see what happens when they're officially announced. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft Montpellier's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good And Evil 2</a> has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of "vapourware", while staunchly refusing to become "abandonware". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children? 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Ah, we josh, Ubisoft, but only because we care. The original Beyond Good And Evil was a magnificent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open worlder</a> with a sense of mystery and whimsy that hasn't quite been seen since. It had a photography element and a talking pig uncle who was an absolute liability in bossfights. I will pounce on any scrap of halfway-positive BG&amp;E2 news I can find. For example, Beyond Good And Evil 2 has a new creative director, Fawzi Mesmar - Ubisoft's vice president of global creative and the former head of design at Battlefield developers DICE.
</p>
<p>
Mesmar's predecessor in the role was Emile Morel, a veteran Ubisoft designer and game director of Rayman Legends, who died suddenly in 2023 at the age of 40. Morel's sad passing is the latest in a long series of misfortunes for the project and its team. According to series creator and former game director Michel Ancel, Beyond Good And Evil 2's development has been on hold for significant chunks of the 16 years since it was announced. Ancel himself departed Ubisoft in September 2020,  amid allegations of mismanagement; Ubisoft staff claimed at the time that he hadn't been involved with Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 for a while.
</p>
<p>
Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 seemed most concrete back in 2017, when Ubisoft finally showed off some footage at E3. The header art above dates back to that time. It looked very weird for a triple-A blockbuster production, and also powerfully unfocussed - a mouthy hybrid of Outer Wilds and Roblox, featuring Cockney monkeys - which perhaps explains the enormous development time. Rather than exploring a single planetary map, as in the first, players would zip about simulated solar systems of part-procedurally generated worlds. There was also a "Space Monkey Program" that would have let players create their own art and music for the game.

<p>
It's unclear how BG&amp;E2 has evolved since then, but Mesmar has a lot of experience overseeing vast productions, so hopefully, he can yank the pieces together in Morel's stead. "Today I'm glad to share that I joined Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 as Creative Director. I have been working with those peeps for years now on this ambitious game and witnessed their talent firsthand," he wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/?originalSubdomain=se">Linkedin</a> this week. "I am standing on the shoulders of creative giants that have supported the team before me, and I look forward to continuing to craft a game that is truly unique for players to enjoy."
</p><p>
Ubisoft has some accompanying comment in which they note that "Mesmar previously collaborated with the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 team as VP of Editorial". In his capacity as a top Ubisoft honcho, he also contributed to development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-good-evil-anniversary-remaster-includes-a-new-mission-with-a-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2">this year's Beyond Good &amp; Evil remaster</a>, which contained a few hints about the long-overdue sequel's story (it's actually a prequel).
</p>
<p>
As ever, all of this is scant grounds for optimism, after such a long wait. I'm genuinely staggered Ubisoft haven't cancelled the game yet. It's pretty eccentric by triple-A standards - far from a proven earner, like Assassin's Creed - and Ubisoft are currently undergoing a well-reported <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">financial slump</a>. Fingers crossed that they'll finally bring it home, and that it won't be another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skull-and-bones-review">Skull And Bones</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero%E2%80%99s-new-patch-nerfs-yajirobe.1018128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-new-patch-yajirobe-nerfs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A couple of days ago, the official Dragon Ball Games account on X (formerly Twitter) revealed that a patch for Sparking Zero should arrive around late October. Their latest post shows the patch is live; check out the changes below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As mentioned in the post, Sparking Zero’s new patch targets several issues, such as responsiveness, balancing and more. The first fix is towards controls becoming unresponsive during online matches when using Classic Controls. The following fix adjusts the difficulty settings for some Episode Battles missions when lower difficulty is selected. Moreover, Yajirobe’s stats have been adjusted, and operational stability has improved.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 The patch is now live! 🚨</p><p>Also, we are aware of some remaining issues and are investigating:<br>-Character rank reset to 0<br>-Connection errors &amp; online matching issues<br>-Corrupted save data<br>We apologize to all affected players and thank you for your patience.</p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1849377423542079847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The new Sparking Zero Patch will delete “the Replay Data” of players’ battles, including Custom Battles World Library replays. Furthermore, the developers acknowledged some additional issues that will be addressed in a later patch. These include character rank resetting to 0, connection errors, online match issues, and corrupted save data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Out of all the changes in Sparking Zero’s latest patch, nerfing Yajirobe is one of the major ones, as this character had become a <a href="https://x.com/dsimons_/status/1847268172912623913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">go-to pick</a> for a significant chunk of the community. It will be interesting to see if the character can retain his position in the player’s DP battle squads after the patch or if the players must find a new meta. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch to Get Multiple Remasters From Third-Party Developers in 2025 to Compensate for Nintendo’s Focus on the Switch 2 – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2025-remasters-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-to-get-multiple-remasters-from-third-party-developers-in-2025-to-compensate-for-nintendo%E2%80%99s-focus-on-the-switch-2-%E2%80%93-rumor.1018113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2025-remasters-switch-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Multiple third-party remasters could be hitting the Nintendo Switch in 2025 to compensate for the publisher's internal team's focus on the console's successors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tvPH-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PH Brazil</a>, who proved to be somewhat reliable in the past, the Japanese publisher itself is planning to release a GameCube game and a Nintendo 3DS game remaster on the console in 2025. Also, Nintendo is reportedly courting third-party publishers to release remasters on the system to beef up its release lineup in 2025 to make sure that players not immediately upgrading to the Nintendo Switch 2 will still have new things to play. This, the leaker highlights, doesn't suggest in any way that the new console is further away than anticipated. Among the publishers that are being courted by Nintendo are Ubisoft, which could release remasters of Splinter Cell Blacklist, Rayman 3, the first two entries in the Driver series, EA and Bandai Namco.</p>
<p><iframe title="2025: The Year of Remasters on Nintendo Switch (English)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/llgNYTpRvOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how the Nintendo Switch release schedule for the first few months of 2025, releasing remasters seems like a good idea to keep the console alive before and shortly after the release of its successor, of which we currently know very little outside of the fact that it has been in the works for a long time. Leaks from the past few months suggest that the system will also support ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS in some capacity. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the actual system, which shouldn't look <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/">too different</a> from the current one, and what it is capable of doing.</p>

            <p>A freshly-discovered glitch in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> has been discovered, allowing players to skip a huge section of the game and head straight to its biggest twist.</p>
<p>I'm being purposefully vague here for spoiler reasons, but if you're at all familiar with the game you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Really, it's surprising that after 26 years players are still finding new ways to skip through the game.</p>

<p>So you've guessed right now I'm talking about Aerith. And this new glitch lets you at last keep her alive.</p>
<p>Well, sort of. Essentially you force her to watch her own death and battle against the mother of her murderer.</p>
<p>As shared by Final Fantasy speedrunner Luzbel on X/Twitter, the skip was discovered by AceZephyr and Kuma.</p>
<p>The glitch does not use any form of cheats. Instead, players can utilise a complex mechanic where the game stores information on the terrain whenever mounting and dismounting a chocobo on the world map. With this, it's possible to walk through the world from early in the game straight to the Forgotten Capital at the end of the first disc.</p>
<p>Of course, players will be pretty underleveled for this section of the game. But with Aerith in the party, it's possible to have her witness her own death and then join the subsequent battle against Jenova.</p>
<p>However, Luzbel notes the game will softlock during a cutscene if Aerith is in the party when she shouldn't be. Still, Aerith saviours can at last rejoice!</p>

<p>This year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> tackled the same section of the game as part of the trilogy remake project. While I won't spoil Aerith's fate here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">treatment of the moment proved controversial</a>.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase stated last month the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-betray-fans-of-the-original-says-series-producer">third part of the trilogy won't "betray the fans of the original"</a>.</p>
<p>"There are these things we feel we can only do now in the remake project that can bring a new happiness, a new sort of feeling of satisfaction to the players playing this game now 27 years later," he said. "What this will entail exactly is something we hope players will experience soon."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</h5><p><span>October 22nd, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Remedy Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>It has been a year since the release of the amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, and the long wait to see the infamous writer back in action has been well worth it, as the game is among the best survival horror games ever released, featuring the same amazing balance between humor and horror that makes Remedy Entertainment the development studio it is, and some truly epic sequences that will continue to resonate in video games history for a long time. For the game's first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/">Night Springs</a>, the Finnish studio went all in with the humor, taking characters and scenarios from the base game and twisting them to present entertaining self-contained stories that did not take themselves too seriously.</p>
<p>Those who wished to experience more of the atmosphere and horror elements of the base game had to wait for the second expansion, The Lake House, which also serves to bridge the gap for what will presumably be the next single-player game set in the Remedy Connected Universe, Control 2. Undoubtedly, the second and final Alan Wake 2 expansion fully delivers its promises, but it could have been so much more, as its very short length will not be enough for most players to upgrade to the Deluxe Edition, which is currently the only way to get both expansions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.10.23-11.08.01.87-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House stars Kiran Estevez, one of the Federal Bureau of Control agents first mentioned in Control that appears in the base game. Leader of the Investigations Unit Beta, the agent was assigned to Bright Falls to investigate the paranormal phenomenons in Cauldron Lake, an investigation that culminates with the inspection of the Lake House, a clandestine research facility on the shores of Cauldron Lake used by the FBC to study the phenomenons happening in the area and their relation to the Dark Presence. Inside, Agent Estevez will get to understand what exactly was being researched in the facility, getting to know how Alan Wake's unique powers have influenced the lives of the two doctors leading the research, all the while trying to stay ahead of the monstruosities born out of the horrible research conducted in the facility.</p>
<p>The story of Alan Wake 2: The Lake House fits perfectly into the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe, further exploring the themes introduced so far and bringing some elements that will likely be developed in the future, including a not subtle-at-all <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> tease. The expansion's short length, barely over one hour and a half, actually plays in favor of the story, as it translates into an extremely tight pacing, which, paired with the tension ramping up from the moment agent Estevez enters the titular Lake House, makes the experience extremely engaging, especially for those heavily involved with the RCU.</p>
<p>The expansion's tightly paced story is compounded by the atmosphere. The Lake House brings out the best Remedy has offered so far in terms of location design, combining the best elements of Alan Wake 2 and Control to offer a very immersive experience with amazing visual and audio production that make players actually feel inside the haunting research facility.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.10.23-11.34.49.35-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Alan Wake 2: The Lake House's short length works in favor of the story, it doesn't do the same with gameplay. With only five floors to explore, featuring a few simple puzzles to complete, which mostly involve carrying batteries to turn the power on and deducing passwords from a few hints scattered around, and only a new enemy type, a frankly well-designed slim monstrosity coming out of the paintings scattered around the research facility, it definitely feels like the expansion ends way too soon. The final boss, at the very least, is very interesting from both a gameplay and a narrative point of view, and makes most players ask themselves who was the real monster hidden in the Lake House.</p>
<p>If Alan Wake 2: The Lake House was priced reasonably, it would have been a much better proposition, as it is a worthy continuation of the base game in terms of story, themes, and atmosphere. As the only way to get the expansion is by purchasing the Deluxe Edition, however, I don't think it offers quite enough to upgrade to the more expensive edition of the game for all but the most die-hard fans of the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>
<p><em>PC version tested. Deluxe Edition code provided by the publisher.</em></p>

<p>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>

<p>The bombastic experience launched in February for PC and PlayStation, where it quickly became beloved by swathes of players wanting to do their bit for liberty by squashing Terminids and, on occasion, each other.</p>
<p>It's a game about co-operation - and as Microsoft games land on PlayStation, this has lead to fans wondering whether Xbox players might eventually get a chance to join in with Helldivers 2 - even if the brand is owned by Sony.</p>

<p>The lack of an Xbox release is something that was recently highlighted again on the Helldivers 2 Discord, when one member posted (with an accompanying weepy emoji): "I just want reinforcements in the way of Xbox players. But that's never gonna happen."</p><p>To this, Arrowhead  community manager Twinbeard replied: "Who says it couldn't? It's not up to us but to Sony and Phil to duke out, but hypothetically speaking, if both partners think it would benefit them from a financial/brand standpoint, it could."</p>
<p>But, duke it out how? Well, earlier in the year, the community manager suggested a game of chess between the two platform holders.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, the fate of Helldivers 2's Xbox dreams remain on the PlayStation maker's shoulders. "If Sony believes it won't [benefit the company] though, it won't," Twinbeard closed.</p>
<p>In other news, Twinbeard has also confirmed Helldivers 2 will get that shiny new PS5 Pro Enhanced label. "There will be differences between the current PS5 and the Pro versions, but what those are is yet to be confirmed," the community lead wrote. </p>

            <p>
Blizzard has announced a livestream dedicated to all things Warcraft for the franchise's 30th anniversary next month. </p>
<p>
The <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-november-13">Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct</a> will broadcast on Wednesday, 13th November at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern, or 10am Pacific for our friends over the pond) and include announcements relating to various Blizzard games. 
</p>
<p>
"It's a big year for the Warcraft universe and whether you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> fan, you've joined the chaos in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-arclight-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a>, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player, there's something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream," Blizzard teased. "You won't want to miss a moment - or a single surprise."
</p>
<p>
The livestream sounds like it'll host Blizzard's biggest set of announcements this year, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzcon-is-cancelled-again-after-last-years-first-in-person-event-since-2019">the company's infamous BlizzCon event currently sits on hiatus</a>.
</p>
<p>So, what do we expect? Well, it seems likely Blizzard will use the event to shed more light on Midnight, its next World of Warcraft expansion following the launch of The War Within this summer. </p>
<p>Midnight is designed to be the middle chapter in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcrafts-the-war-within-expansion-kickstarts-worldsoul-saga-next-year">trilogy of expansions that commemorate the veteran MMO's first 20 years, and propel it forward into the future</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to tune into the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, YouTube and TikTok, with as-yet unrevealed rewards for Blizzard fans simply for watching.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I spoke to Jason Schreier about his new book Play Nice, for a look <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/behind-the-scenes-at-blizzard-jason-schreier-talks-misconduct-swingers-parties-and-what-press-got-wrong">behind the scenes at Blizzard and to hear more about the developer's misconduct scandal</a>, swingers parties and much more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> have released an update to the third-person shooter that reverts a lot of tough difficulty changes made in a previous patch. Turns out upping the spawn rate of the vicious Tyrannid baddies across all difficulty modes was not welcome among the meathead murder boys of the Imperium. And this change wasn't the only one that caused enough ructions to justify hasty recalibrations from Saber Interactive. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last week, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4538031058666780902?snr=1_5_9_">patch 4.0</a> for the action game introduced a "lethal" difficulty mode alongside a new Operations map (the shooter's replayable co-op multiplayer jaunts). It also created a modifier that forced players to stay close to one another, or face swift annihilation. By universally increasing the number of spawning enemies to bump up the hardcore difficulty settings, they also made all lower difficulties tougher. The new difficulty setting was meant to be punishing, but even at the time Saber were unsure about the changes they were implementing.</p>
<p>"Overall these changes are going to make Operations mode harder, but it is difficult to measure by how much," they said in the previous patch notes. "We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change."</p>
<p>They were not wrong to be wary. Following the patch, some players were annoyed enough to leave the gamer equivalent of dog poo in a bag on a doorstep, with over 2700 stinky Steam reviews piling up within a week of the patch hitting the game (compared to approximately 340 negative reviews the week before the patch). The general feeling was that Operations had become more frustrating, even on easier difficulties. </p><p>Today, the devs have rejigged things. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4530150757095178287">the notes for Patch 4.1</a>, the developer sets out their reasoning for the previous changes and give details on the roll back. Mainly, that enemy spawn rate has been reduced.  But armour has also been increased in "ruthless" difficulty, damage has been increased for bolt guns, and AI soldier buds will now do a lot more damage to bosses. On top of all that, the "tight formation" modifier that made it hard for players to wander far from co-op pals for solo sniping, has been entirely removed. A significant bug that made your roll distance shorter has also been squashed.</p>
<p>"Your feedback made it clear that the game had become more intense and stressful on lower difficulties, and this was never our intention," said game director Dmitriy Grigorenko in a message to players. "As I’ve personally emphasised in interviews, Space Marine 2 is all about the power fantasy, and Patch 4.0 negatively impacted it for many of you. This is why we’re rolling back these changes.</p>
<p>"The key takeaway for me, personally, is that I forgot that once the game comes out, it's no longer a dev's game. It's yours first and foremost."</p>
<p>When I wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a>, my biggest gripe on normal difficulty wasn't the number of enemies per se (although it did sometimes get overwhelming). I just hated the Zoanthropes. These floating ranged attackers buff all other enemies around them and force you to fire into the sky ignoring the busy crowds at ground level. They are insect asshats. But would you believe it, even these are getting addressed in the latest patch.</p>
<p>"Fighting Zoanthropes is often reported as a source of frustration," said Grigorenko. "Alongside the changes to the AI Director, we’re taking away some of their shields’ effectiveness to alleviate some of that frustration."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director.1018059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Ubisoft's long-awaited Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains in development, and now has a new creative director taking the project forward.
</p>
<p>
Despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">record-breaking marathon on-again, off-again development cycle</a> stretching back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bg-and-e-sequel-to-be-more-accessible">almost 20 years</a>, Ubisoft appears to be demonstrating its commitment to finally getting Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 done by appointing company veteran Fawzi Mesmar as the game's new creative lead. 
</p>
<p>
Mesmar has worked at Ubisoft for two decades - hey, that's nearly as long as Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development! - and previously served as the company's overall boss of creative development. He's a senior and experienced pair of hands, for a project that has gone through numerous iterations and various senior staffing changes over the years - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">departure of franchise creator Michel Ancel</a> in 2020 after accusations of toxic behaviour, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies">the sad death in 2023 of Emile Morel</a>, the game's previous creative director.
</p>
<p>
"With more than 20 years as an award-winning game designer and creative director, Mesmar has been instrumental in the successful launch of over 20 video games," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer today. 
</p>
<p>
"Mesmar previously collaborated with the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 team as VP of Editorial. In his new role, he's focused on continuing to build upon the vision set forth by our late friend and colleague, Emile Morel."
</p>
<p>
It's been well over a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-ubisoft-insists">Ubisoft last told Eurogamer that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remained in development</a> despite various shake-ups at the publisher, and nothing has been seen of it since.
</p>
<p>
Still, the franchise has been kept alive by a polished 20th Anniversary re-release of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-originally-featured-in-beyond-good-evil-and-other-development-secrets">a wealth of behind-the-scenes content</a> plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">all-new story content that directly sets up Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> (which, narratively, acts a prequel).
</p><p>
Discussion of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has bubbled up again this week in the wake of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">Insider Gaming</a> report which stated some staff who previously worked on Prince of Persia: The Last Crown had since joined the project. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Ubisoft also confirmed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">tapped Michel Ancel to consult on its plans for the future of the Rayman franchise</a>.

            <p>Not content with just leaking details prior to the event, people are now streaming Nintendo's mysterious Switch Online playtest on the likes of YouTube and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced a mysterious playtest relating to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service</a> earlier this month. It kept further details under wraps, but noted places would be limited, and only up to 10,000 people would be accepted to participate. At this time, Nintendo asked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">successful applicants not to disclose details of the test publicly</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>But, what with people being people, they did. It began last week, when a number of participants shared screenshots from documentation sent to program participants on social media. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/details-of-nintendos-mysterious-switch-online-playtest-leak">images spoke of an almost MMO-sounding Minecraft-like game</a>, featuring blocky worlds.</p><p>And now, people are once again ignoring Nintendo's request that the playtest be kept under wraps, and are streaming the playtest. Users on reddit have linked to streams of the test, and confirmed once again that the game has Minecraft-style elements featuring building. "Minecraft + WoW + Nintendo Mii games but very barbones at the moment [because] it's just a test," is how one user described it.</p>
<p>"It looks to be part Minecraft-like, part shared social hub(?), with persistent worlds supporting a <em>lot</em> of players at once," another added. One said from what they watched, the "vibes" of the playtest are "immaculate".</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest kicked off earlier today, and is set to run for a little under two weeks, concluding on 6th November.</p>

<p>It is not just the playtest Nintendo is seeing its community bend the rules on, somewhat. There have also been reports of troublemakers at the Nintendo museum in Japan.</p>
<p>As noted by X user Genki, one recent visitor uploaded pictures of prototype consoles on social media, which were taken from an exhibit you are not allowed to take photos of. Meanwhile, another person reportedly tried to unplug controller cords to check for emulators during their visit to the museum. Sigh.</p>

		<p>New World: Aeternum is the biggest shake-up Amazon’s MMORPG has seen since it launched in 2021. Not only does it introduce new features and content, it also brings the game to consoles with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions now live, complete with cross-play servers, making this the best opportunity in a long time for new comers to jump in.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With New World: Aeternum, Amazon has set its sights firmly on a new audience, though there’s plenty for veterans to sink their teeth into, and a lure to bring lapsed players back to the game. Personally, I missed the boat back in 2021 – although I enjoyed playing the various alpha and beta tests for the game, I didn’t want an MMO in my life and it’s fair to say that the genre has an established track record for rough launch windows. Now, after spending a dozen or so hours with Aeternum, I understand why the game managed to maintain a small yet zealous fan base and why Amazon thought it deserved a second chance.</p>


<p>Set during the Age of Exploration, players find themselves aboard a ship headed for the New World and helmed by some less than savoury characters. The voyage doesn’t go entirely to plan, however. Upon approaching the uncharted realms of Aeternum, your ship and its crew are scattered by the mysterious Stormwall – not quite the welcome party you had anticipated.</p>


<p>Two of the biggest changes new players benefit from in New World: Aeternum are the introduction of Archetypes, as well as a more dynamic approach to story-telling, via cutscenes and character dialogue. Eschewing the normal MMO class system, characters in New World are defined by their choice of weapon – these determine the active and passive abilities available to you while influencing the core stats you focus on upgrading each time you level up. While you are free to experiment later on, Archetypes present a handful of weapon combos with a distinct playstyle and theme. For instance the Mystic dabbles with strange arcana, wielding the Life Staff and Void Gauntlet, and being the closest to a healer/support class. Meanwhile, the Musketeer is a nimble, flashy DPS fighter who favours the musket and rapier.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, story-telling is another big focus, New World’s tutorial feeling more like the intro to an open-world action RPG rather than an MMO. The cutscenes – a mix of pre-rendered, in-game, and animations – do a great job of setting the tone and establishing key characters and concepts straight off-the-bat. Within those first minutes you’re already duelling upon the deck of a burning ship, traversing overgrown ruins, and peeling back the first layer of Aeternum’s rich lore.</p>
<p>Instead of arriving on the shores of the Americas as we know them, New World asks what would happen if explorers were transported to a continent wreathed in magic and mystery. Its stories steer into fantasy territory rather than being a retelling of our own colonial history, weaving together myths and muskets.</p>

<p>Being an action RPG makes the gameplay a lot more palpable on console. Even if something like Final Fantasy XIV works remarkably well on PlayStation, New World’s combat system is a more natural fit with light, heavy, and ranged attacks as well as blocks, dodges, and a camera lock on akin to Dark Souls and Elden Ring. Each weapon has six unlockable active abilities, allowing you to equip a maximum of three at one time with the power to switch between your primary and secondary weapon in an instant. It doesn’t sound like much, especially compared to classic MMOs such as World of Warcraft that plaster every free pixel of the user interface with icons for countless class abilities. While some genre diehards will feel restricted, this paring back feels refreshingly accessible, especially if you’re looking to master more than just your two starter weapons. Additional loadout customisation comes via a catalogue of passive abilities as well as your gear stats and bonuses.</p>
<p>As someone who gravitates towards healer and support archetypes, there’s always the worry that the solo levelling experience in MMOs will suffer. However, almost 30 levels into New World (with the cap being 65) I’ve not had to respawn once with only a couple of nail-biting encounters. This, I hope, is something that will change as I progress further and start dipping my toes in group PvE content, though it’s largely a result of me being slightly over-leveled for my current zone and making sure my gear is as good as it can be.</p>

<p>Outside of combat, there’s plenty to see and do in New World with a plethora of craft-based skills that feed into the game’s economy. Hunting for resource nodes is one of those chore-like pursuits I’ve never really enjoyed in MMOs though it’s somehow more immersive in Aeternum. For example, when woodcutting you’ll actually see trees fall. Rare minerals and fauna are often found scattered around key landmarks, encouraging you to explore and soak in New World’s beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The best thing about my first experience with New World: Aeternum is knowing that I’ve only just scratched the surface. So far it has been a fun and somewhat enthralling solo-levelling experience with more social, multiplayer features beginning to reveal themselves. From player housing, dungeons, and raids, to PvP arena battles and sweeping faction wars, I’m eager to see where Amazon’s MMO will take me.</p>

            <p>I know there's a lot of good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvanias</a> floating around, but I implore you to take a look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardust-demon">Stardust Demon</a>. Developed by two-person queer married team resnijars, it looks like a real charmer. All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs. It's also out now, which is good for people like me who crave bizzarovanias.</p>

<p>In Stardust Demon you play as Algol, a fuzzy demon bear (?) who explores alien planets. You'll solve puzzles, do some nice hopping, grind on neon rails, and hit baddies with your powers - of which, there are lots. You've got fire breathe, you've got sticky bombs, a reflect beam, and the best-sounding one? A pogo stick.</p>
<p>As for those planets, there's Wexia, replete with "dangerous flora and fauna" and home to "worm-like and quirky Wexoids". Klonix is the "ethereal planet" and actually home to <em>friendly</em> demons, while Purrafiny is an aquatic number and outpost for "nefarious poachers" and "animal collectors". There are more (some aren't even planets) and, honestly, they look 1000% more interesting and quirky than a lot of worlds I've seen in retro-fied platformers nowadays. The trailer really highlights their diversity. </p><p>Another thing I'd like to highlight is Algol's walk: a very good little plod that makes the physical act of pottering around those vicious planets lighter on the heart in general. Never underestimate the power of a good walk animation, I say.</p>
<p>You can find the game over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815500/Stardust_Demon/">on Steam</a> if you're keen.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It’s hard to pick out the highlights from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s latest SteamOS update, 3.6.19, just because its collection of tweaks and fixes seems to span the entire gamut of handheld PC hardware as a concept. Graphics driver improvements! Third-party <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">SSDs</a> working better! More balanced display colours! No more "spurious power LED blinking"! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4676514574283544995">Full patch notes are here</a>. If some of these amendments seem familiar to experienced Deck users, that’s because they’ve been knocking around the Preview and Beta branches of SteamOS <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4213757668851885208">since at least May</a>. Version 3.6.19 finally brings them all together on the Stable branch, the default and least bug-prone flavour of SteamOS that I’d suspect the majority of owners have never switched from.</p>
<p>Also, sod it, let’s pick out some of the best stuff. Improved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> reliability – especially for certain SanDisk models – sounds good, and I’ve actually bumped into the exact black screen issue when switching between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Desktop Mode</a> and Gaming Mode that this updates banishes. The LCD Steam Deck getting up to 10% better battery life "in light load conditions" might be handy for lengthy download sessions as well, and it’s nice to see that the older model specifically getting more love.</p>
<p>Don’t get your hopes up too much about the suggested graphics performance improvements; I’ve ran a few quick benchmarks in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and neither seem to run any faster. But you might still see better stability in certain RAM-heavy games, and at the very least, I’ll take the higher responsiveness when flicking through the UI. I’ve been testing out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-the-computex-2024-pc-hardware-announcements-that-are-actually-interesting">Zotac Zone</a> this week (review forthcoming) and, like all Windows-based handhelds, it quickly made me pine for SteamOS’ snappiness.</p><p>Anyhoo, 3.6.19 is available to install right now for all Stable branch users; you can enable the installation in the System page of the Steam Deck’s settings. The only other thing I’d point out is that while the patch notes list some fixes for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths">Game Recording</a>, the video-clipping feature itself has still only got as far as the Beta branch. You can switch to that, from Stable, by selecting Beta in the System Update Channel section.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The God of War TV series will take longer than expected to reach your home screens. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> nearly two years ago, it would have featured Rafe Judkins (The Wheel of Time) as its showrunner and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby as its producers. However, all three have recently left the project despite having prepared multiple scripts for the show's debut season. Amazon and Sony have decided to move in a different direction, though the scripts were reportedly praised regardless.</p>
<p>Now, Deadline has <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-ronald-d-moore-amazon-series-showrunner-1236122550/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the new head honcho: Ronald D. Moore. Veteran Star Trek fans will know him as the producer of Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, although more recently, he rose to fame for the Battlestar Galactica reboot series as well as Outlander and For All Mankind. According to the report, Moore will be at the same time writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the God of War TV series. Sony Santa Monica's God of War creative director Cory Barlog is still an executive producer alongside Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan from PlayStation Productions, Hermen Hulst from Sony Interactive Entertainment, and Roy Lee from Vertigo Entertainment. Last but not least, Sony Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is still listed as co-executive producer.</p>
<p>We don't really know a lot about the God of War TV series beyond the fact that it will adapt the Norse saga, starting with the 2018 game. Fans are already going wild with the actors they'd like to see in the key roles, such as Kratos, Atreus, Freya, Baldur, Mimir, Brok, Sindri, and Modi. As a reminder, the second and final installment in the Norse saga <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted on PC last month</a>, although it didn't quite reach the same concurrent player peak as the previous entry on Steam. The next game from Sony Santa Monica may not be a God of War at all, though, with Cory Barlog reportedly working on a brand new sci-fi IP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fifa-ultimate-team-packs-arent-gambling-rules-austrian-court/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/key-austrian-court-finds-fifa-ultimate-team-packs-are-not-gambling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> today that the Higher Regional Court of Vienna has ruled in favor of Electronic Arts on the subject of FIFA Ultimate Team Packs being gambling or not.</p>
<p>According to the judge, players do not purchase FIFA Ultimate Team packs intending to make a profit but only to use them in the game. As such, according to Australian law,&nbsp; the lack of economic risk means they cannot be considered gambling. Moreover, FUT packs cannot be considered separately from the game itself, which is not a game of chance but a game of skill.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Electronic Arts was very happy with the outcome and is calling the ruling 'direction setting' in a statement:</p>
<p><em>This is a direction-setting decision from the Higher Regional Court of Vienna and follows similar first instance decisions from other Austrian courts in recent months. We design our games to bring choice, fairness, value, and fun, and we are pleased with the court’s findings that FIFA Ultimate Team packs are not gambling and that players generally do not acquire them to make a profit but simply as part of the game. EA continues to believe that optional in-game purchases, when done right, play an important role in giving players a choice in how they want to engage with a game. This ruling rightly recognizes that spending is always optional, and most players choose not to spend at all.</em></p>
<p>It's a big win for the publisher, which was recently forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-lootboxes-get-official-drop-rate-disclosure-from-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclose</a> the actual drop rate of lootboxes in Respawn's popular free-to-play Battle Royale game Apex Legends to comply with a new law in South Korea. As expected, it turned out to be very low - just 0.045%, to be precise. However, there's a safeguard in place to ensure a drop after opening 500 Apex Packs without any luck.</p>

            <p>To be fair, there are several, far more substantial additions teased in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3 </a>design director Mitchell Heastie’s <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/33-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-5-3-dev-blog">latest blog</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>’s upcoming Patch 5.3. There’s also some interesting insight regarding design decisions, and the systems CA are hoping to tweak in the future. We’ll talk about that in a moment, but first, I must draw your attention to this magical map. I’m very excited about it. Not so much for what it does on its own - more for what its design philosophy represents and could mean for future additions.</p>

<p>‘Maad’s Map’ is part of a planned ancillary rebalance - ancillaries being the magical items you can equip characters with. The actual rebalance itself (aiming to bring rarity more in line with power, among other things) isn’t coming with this patch, but 5.3 will include 18 new generic items, plus 6 new rare unique, including the map. Using it gives your chosen lord a massive 50% bonus to campaign movement range, but also has a 20% to warp them to a random nearby region at the end of their turn.</p>
<p>What I love about this map is its introduction of an element of dice-rolling, narrative chaos that’s otherwise noticeably absent from both the game and, honestly, contemporary Warhammer tabletop - at least compared to older editions. There are still a few examples - notably the chance for your spellcasters to singe their fingertips on the searing hobs of their own hubris by miscasting powerful spells. But I think this map is right on the money. It’s creative. It’s risky. Most of all, it’s weird! I can absolutely see why you wouldn’t want to use it, but it even existing suggests a willingness on the design team’s part to introduce other, stranger items down the line. Now buff all the Skaven weapons team and give them the opportunity to also miscast, and we’ll be in business.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the blog there’s some multiplayer rebalancing, a new unit in Grave Guard with halberds, and a rework for a couple of Ogre Kingdoms mechanics in the lead up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greenskins-ogres-and-khorne-are-all-coming-in-the-next-dlc-for-total-war-warhammer-3">their presence in the next expansion</a>. Namely, more and better Ogre mercenaries you can hire from camps as other factions, and a new bounties system that makes them a bit more consistent.</p>
<p>I also found this part interesting, regarding Control and Corruption:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't have too much information to share just yet on what our plans are with these features, but the complexity of dealing with both of these mechanics is larger than you might think. They are both core game systems that affect every single race in the game, and each faction's relationship with these systems can be, and often is, unique.</p>
<p>They're long standing Total War features and I think they suffer from a legacy of being carried from game to game without a real deep dive into what their place in the game actually entails.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d like to pick the team’s brains at some point about how many of these legacy systems they feel are actually holding the game back in some way - or at least not contributing to the experience they envision. Either way, I appreciate the insight and transparency here.</p><p>There’s still no word on when exactly the next expansion - which features Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne - will arrive, but my money’s on early December. I, for one, look forward to curling up by my roaring space heater with a ‘winter fire 10 hours’ video on the second monitor, cracking open a cold can of Sugar Plum Monster Energy, and punching everything in the Old World to gore and gubbins.</p>
<p>In other, less Orc-y Creative Assembly news, Alien Isolation director Al Hope <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-is-getting-a-sequel-10-years-later">recently announced</a> that a sequel to Alien Isolation was in the works. What’s the Xenomorph’s charge bonus, Al? How viable is its missile block chance? Tell me!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Remote Control.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Under any other circumstance, The Lake House would sound like a nice spot for a serene summer getaway. In this case, though, it’s the setting for the second and final installment of Alan Wake II DLC, so it is naturally anything but. There’s no rest and relaxation to be found here, only another double-fisted dose of flashlights and firepower in this tightly paced two-hour tour inside the cold, concrete walls of a remote Federal Bureau of Control facility. In raw gameplay terms, The Lake House is not as eccentric a departure as Night Springs was a few months’ back, but as far as closing the book on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II’s</a> story and providing a bridge to the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> goes, it’s yet another meta-storytelling slam dunk for the team at Remedy Entertainment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alan Wake II: The Lake House Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You might remember The Lake House from the main <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> campaign, or at the very least the exterior of its grounds since it’s found behind a locked gate in Cauldron Lake near where the murder victim is found at the start of Saga Anderson’s story. This FBC research facility was strictly off-limits to Saga, but in this new chapter we’re able to fully explore it as returning FBC Agent Kiran Estevez. I liked Estevez in the main campaign and was happy to spend some time in her shoes, but the real show-stealing performances here come from the husband and wife scientist team of Jules and Diana Marmont. Initially I was laughing out loud at the petty bickering between them that occurs in the facility’s welcome video, but their relationship evidently took a much darker turn as evidenced by the many memos and emails I pored over as I continued my engrossing investigation inside the sinister shapeshifting structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facility itself is only five floors, but thanks to its proximity to the Altered World Event in Cauldron Lake and the disturbing research experiments conducted by the Marmonts, The Lake House is as consistently unsettling a space as anything from the main <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> campaign. One floor finds Estevez caught in a disorientating loop, another has shifting canvases splashed in abstract Jackson Pollock-style sprays, while another still is just a near-never-ending room of ominously clattering typewriters, like a manifestation of the infinite monkey theorem minus the tiny simian scribes. It’s a superbly constructed bit of otherworldly office space that I delighted in exploring, whether I was thumbing through the chilling pages of another Alan Wake manuscript or having conversations with a possessed painting so angry it made Vigo the Carpathian from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/ghostbusters-2-1989">Ghostbusters II</a> seem like a portrait of a puppy dog.     </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lake House is as consistently unsettling a space as anything from the main Alan Wake II campaign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lake House is absolutely blanketed in an unnerving atmosphere, but it’s perhaps a little lacking as far as puzzles go. Aside from carrying battery cubes to electrical sockets, which stimulates the eye with its orange glow but isn’t particularly taxing on the brain, there are otherwise only a handful of computer passwords to figure out using calendar dates mentioned in memos and the like. These hackneyed hacking jobs are pretty easy to deduce, and it was a little disappointing that there was nothing new here to match the mind-bending magic tricks provided by Alan’s world-altering Angel Lamp in the main campaign.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shadow Complex</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat against the shadow-cloaked staff of The Lake House is equally as straightforward for the most part, but it’s still extremely tense thanks to its typically claustrophobic close-quarters encounters. Estevez might be an FBC agent, but sadly she doesn’t possess the shapeshifting gun or superpowers that Jesse Faden wielded in 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control">Control</a>. Instead, a pistol, shotgun, and a combination of flashlight, flares, and flashbangs are at her disposal, and I burned through every last round and spare battery as I desperately tried to illuminate and exterminate each sickle-slinging flanker and sledgehammer-swinging heavy that ambushed me along the way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of its main boss fight, there’s only one new enemy type to be found in The Lake House, but it’s a doozy. The long-limbed freaks that slither out of painted canvases seem like Remedy’s towering, tie-dyed take on the Slender Man, and since they seem immune to Estevez’s attacks I was going hard on the dodge button early on to frantically try and evade their outstretched clutches. Eventually Estevez gets her hands on a grenade launcher powerful enough to turn the tables on these paint-streaked Stretch Armstrongs, but that didn’t mean that dealing with them ever became too easy – grenade ammo is scarce, the painted shadows are slim enough that they’re somewhat easy to miss, and the fact you need to charge up each shot before you fire puts some added pressure into the timing of each takedown. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lake House’s challenge jumped up even further in its final boss fight – whose identity was a fun surprise from a story perspective – and it brought my brief return trip to the world of Alan Wake II to a dazzling and demanding denouement. My short stay in The Lake House was brutalist in its architecture and brutalising in its action, and although it’s bittersweet that my time with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> has officially come to an end, the tantalising story teases of what comes next in the Remedy Connected Universe has me locked and loaded for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.  </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Lake House DLC is another spectacular and spooky slice of Alan Wake II action. It introduces some fantastic new supporting characters to the Remedy Connected Universe, as well as a terrifying new enemy type to overcome and some wonderfully eerie environments to explore. The challenge of its puzzles may be light, but its combat is still chillingly dark even despite the fact it’s not hugely different from that of the main game, and scouring for the many notes, videos, and audio recordings littered throughout its fear-inducing facility made for a genuinely gripping investigation. Funny, frightening, and full of surprises, The Lake House DLC is a tightly paced slice of psychological horror that serves as an absorbing addendum to Alan Wake II. </p></div></div><div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Alan Wake II: The Lake House DLC Review</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>great</p><p>The Lake House DLC is a tightly paced slice of psychological horror that serves as an absorbing addendum to Alan Wake II.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a world of first-person shooters, Rainbow Six Siege reigns as one of the greatest. The popular multiplayer extraction shooter has been popular since its release back in 2015, continuing to keep a steady player base and competitive fanbase. The game’s Ranked system has gotten increasingly popular with players, too.</p>



<p>Here are all the ranks in Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-ranks-in-rainbow-six-siege">All Ranks in Rainbow Six Siege</h2>



<p>Like many other games, Rainbow Six Siege’s Ranked system follows an element system, with Bronze, Copper and so on. Here is a list of all the ranks in Rainbow Six Siege and the Matchmaking Rating (MMR) needed to progress forward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Copper: 0 – 1,599 MMR</li>



<li>Bronze: 1,600 – 2,099 MMR</li>



<li>Silver: 2,100 – 2,599 MMR</li>



<li>Gold: 2,600 – 3,100 MMR</li>



<li>Platinum: 3,200 – 4,099 MMR</li>



<li>Diamond: 4,100 – 4,999 MMR.</li>



<li>Champions: 5,000 MMR.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>From Copper to Champions, ranking up in Rainbow Six Siege is no easy feat. Many players tend to give up early on, so pat yourself on the back if you have made it to Champions.</p>



<p>So, what is MMR?</p>







<h2 id="h-explaining-matchmaking-ratings-mmr">Explaining Matchmaking Ratings (MMR)</h2>



<p>Like all other games, Rainbow Six Siege has its own competitive rank points. Just like Fortnite used to have Arena points, Rainbow Six utilizes MMR. </p>



<p>MMR is a system of numerical points that begin at 0 and allow players to hit Champions rank when they reach 5,000 MMR. The points do not stop there, however, and continue to rise if a player does well in Ranked.</p>



<p>The game has two MMR scores, though. Your MMR is tracked separately in Unranked modes while also tracked in Ranked modes. This system is quite different than a lot of other competitive games, as many only track points in Ranked modes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-are-so-back.1017930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/harpoon-97-micrporose-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know this might be hard to believe from the comfort of 2024, but there used to be a big, competitive market for hardcore naval strategy games on the PC. <em>Harpoon </em>was the most popular of these games, and–I swear I am not making this up–back in the 90s it used to have prominent features in mainstream games mags, and even posters in video game stores.</p><p><em>Harpoon</em> was also a game that looked like this:</p><figure></figure><p>A series that has continued through the 2000s to look pretty much like this, <em>Harpoon </em>is a strategy franchise in the most traditional grognardy sense, forgoing any visual flair for the raw, weighty pleasures of math and authenticity. If other video games use graphics as a means of representing code and numbers, <em>Harpoon</em>--like other classics like <em>Gary Grigsby's War in the East</em>--only really cares about the numbers. If you have ever complained about a Paradox game being cold and unwieldy, you don't know shit. You are a small baby, a sweet child of summer.</p><p><em>Harpoon</em>, with its accounting software-like interface and myriad of systems it is trying to simulate, was a very tough nut to crack, but once a certain type of person willing to put in the work could crack it, it was by all accounts <em>great</em> (I tried, repeatedly, but was never that person.). Like I said, people still play the series today! So it's maybe not too surprising to hear that Microprose, exactly the kind of publisher who you would expect to bring <em>Harpoon</em> back in 2024, is bringing <em>Harpoon </em>back.</p><p>The publisher this week announced a re-release of a re-release of a re-release of the original 1989 <em>Harpoon</em>, which was remade in 1994 as <em>Harpoon Classic</em> then <em>again</em> in 1997 as this game, the one that's coming to Steam next month, <em>Harpoon 97</em>. The promo material says it features "new displays, updated scenarios, and a more intuitive interface", but I'm not sure if those are just the republished selling points from the 1997 press release, because take a look at <em>Harpoon 97's</em> trailer:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Harpoon Classic '97 - Publishing Announcement" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmop246H2kk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I must stress here that this is fine! Actually it's more than fine, it's expected: this is what this series and this genre looks like, whether you like it or not, and it would be really weird to play a <em>Harpoon </em>game and suddenly find yourself confronted with "graphics". Like 2023's <em>Rule The Waves 3</em> (see below), there's a certain throwback charm to this, and the people who will actually be spending money on this game wouldn't have it any other way.</p><div><figure><p>https://twitter.com/LukePlunkett/status/1659139438809870336</p></figure></div><p>(Besides, anyone who <em>does</em> want to play a modern naval combat game with graphics can just buy one of Microprose's <em>other </em>upcoming releases,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286220/Sea_Power__Naval_Combat_in_the_Missile_Age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Sea Power</em></a>.)</p><p>I'm excited for this! At least I am, conceptually! I'm sure I will once again try to play this game and once again fail to understand or enjoy it, but for me, that's beside the point. The point here is that Microprose is about to release something that people under the age of 25 wouldn't even think qualifies as a video game, where modern ideas like "art style" and "user experience" are nowhere to be found, and loads of people will enjoy it regardless. I think that fucking rules.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
