                <p dir="ltr">Virture and 8BitDo have teamed up on a new smartphone controller designed specifically for use with the Viture Pro XR glasses. You can slot your Android phone into the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</a> to turn it into a Steam Deck- or Switch 2-style gaming handheld. However, unlike 8BitDo's original Ultimate Mobile Controller and similar models that use Bluetooth to connect to your phone, this uses USB-C 3.0, and features an additional USB port for connecting the Viture XR and Pro XR glasses for zero-lag gameplay. The $79 controller is available now at Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">While it currently only supports Android, Virtue says an iOS model will be available soon as well. A bundle that includes the Viture Pro XR Galsses and 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller is also available for $468.</p><div title="6532520 - Viture x 8BitDo ultimate controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3724" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532520 - Viture x 8BitDo ultimate controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Viture X 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$79</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller is an all-in-one mobile and XR gaming setup that utilizes USB 3.0 for a plug-and-play experience. As the name implies, it uses the excellent 8BitDo Ultimate--one of our favorite third-party controllers available on all consoles--as the basis for the design and features, including Hall Effect thumbsticks and triggers, two extra back buttons, and support for button remapping and other customization settings via the 8BitDo Ultiamte Software V2 app on mobile and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">The 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller's direct USB 3.0 connection is important because it eliminates the input lag present on some Bluetooth mobile controllers and prevents interference from other wireless signals. It also means the controller offers seamless, lag-free passthrough for the Viture XR glasses.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, 8BitDo also offers a Bluetooth version of its Ultimate Mobile Controller. While it lacks the low-latency input and video pass-through afforded by the new model's USB 3.0 connectivity, it's otherwise identical in features and form factor. This is also an Android-only device, but it's available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> models, both of which are available for $50 at Amazon.</p><h3 dir="ltr">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controllers</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller (Bluetooth, Android) - Black</a> -- $50</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller (Bluetooth, Android) - White</a> -- $50</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture X 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller (USB 3.0, Android)</a> -- $80</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.viture.com/product/viture-x-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-pack?color=Jet+Black" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture X 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller + Viture Pro XR Glasses Bundle</a> -- $468 (a $538 Value)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Switch 2 Preorders Are Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>   </ul> </div>

That’s fun! Now let’s check the internet to see how people are reacting to the Direct... oh...oh no. Way too many of you care about <em>Donkey Kong/Mario</em> lore! That’s weird, because Nintendo don’t give a shit about any of that stuff and that’s wonderful.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196698" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="196698,196646,196055" data-current="196698"><div><p>Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22254.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> launches next month. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-1851784723&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-1851784723">On Wednesday, Nintendo shared a 15-minute Direct all about the game</a></span>. As a result, I’m very excited to play <em>Bananza</em>. It looks awesome, letting DK punch and destroy everything. It also co-stars a young Pauline, who is DK’s companion in the game, riding on his shoulder and using her singing ability to help the big ape solve puzzles and destroy more stuff. I think that inclusion alone wouldn’t have broken too many people’s brains, but at one point in the Direct we briefly see Donkey Kong and young Pauline interact with Cranky Kong. And that has caused <em>chaos</em> among Nintendo lore nerds.</p><figure id="" data-id="349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-recommend-id="image://349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Screenshot of YouTube comments debating DK Bananza's place in the lore.

So seeing Pauline as a child hanging out with an aged Cranky Kong makes it hard for wiki editors and super fans to figure out how to connect <em>Bananza </em>to the other <em>Mario </em>and <em>Donkey Kong</em> games.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over on YouTube</a></span>, there are literally hundreds of comments from many people debating how to make the lore work. </p><p>Some speculate that <em>Bananza</em> is retconning the original game.

Some <em>DK / Mario</em> purists are denouncing the game as non-canonical. Some think Pauline is actually Pauline’s daughter. Still others are expecting this to be a prequel to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and it will reveal the origins of New Donk City, where we meet an adult Mayor Pauline. </p><figure id="" data-id="f24fe3227c84434922a4e159de77b53c" data-recommend-id="image://f24fe3227c84434922a4e159de77b53c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a huge comment about DK lore.

So, here’s the answer you’ve been looking for. Here’s why and how Pauline, as a kid, is talking to Cranky Kong. You ready? Here you go: Nintendo doesn’t care about lore and just wants to make fun games. That’s it. Simple as that. </p><p>And honestly, that’s so nice. I love it so much. Truly, Nintendo devs couldn’t care less about canon, timelines, and <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore. They just make great games that make you smile. The company doesn’t let decades of backstory impede its ability to be creative and do new things. Pauline is a kid in this game because the people making <em>Bananza</em> thought it would be a fun idea, and Nintendo agreed. </p><p>Besides, the <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore is a mess anyway. Cranky Kong’s appearance in the Direct is seen by many as a smoking gun that reveals <em>Bananza</em> to be a reboot or a time travel story. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But on the <em>Mario</em> Wiki page for Cranky, you’ll find a nearly 800-word section</a></span> about how his connection to Donkey Kong has never been consistent. Sometimes he’s DK’s grandpa, sometimes he’s DK’s dad, sometimes he might not even be related. Sometimes Nintendo has acknowledged this nonsense; other times, they just treat the current Donkey Kong as the sole big ape that long ago kidnapped Pauline. None of this has <em>ever </em>been nailed down consistently, and acting like it has is silly!</p><p>Look, I get it. I love <em>Star Wars</em> lore. I get nerdy about it, too. I’m not trying to say people can’t have fun. But far too many of the comments I’ve seen about this <em>Bananza</em> lore debate seem to be taking it far too seriously, as if Nintendo is vindictively shitting on Rare’s legacy. That doesn’t make sense considering all the references to Rare’s<em> DK Country </em>games included in the Direct. </p><p>The thing about lore is that it’s fun to ponder and discuss, but it should never be allowed to completely derail anyone’s ability to tell a new story or make something cool with classic characters. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> seems like a blast. Don’t let the lore get in the way of that. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yesterday, Microsoft confirmed that it's not abandoning the home console market just yet. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA">a short video teaser</a>, Xbox President Sarah Bond highlighted a "strategic multi-year partnership with AMD" that will include "our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands." But while we know that the "in your hands" part will include devices <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">like the Windows-powered ROG Xbox Ally</a>, there are still few specifics about what exactly Microsoft has planned for its future living room consoles (aside from what Bond calls "the next generation of graphics innovation").</p>
<p>Reading between the lines a bit, though, we wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft was getting ready to finally tear down the thinning wall separating gaming PCs and gaming consoles. A Windows-based, living room-focused Xbox capable of running generic Windows games could accentuate Microsoft's strengths in PC gaming while papering over many of the company's recent struggles in the home console market.</p>
<h2>WindowsBox</h2>
<p>The once-bright line separating PC gaming and TV-based console gaming has been deteriorating for years. On the hardware side, bespoke console chips and development environments long ago gave way to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps4-pc-like-architecture-8gb-ram-delight-developers">PC-like architectures</a> that are simpler and easier for developers to work with. And on the PC interface side, efforts like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/steam-comes-to-the-living-room-tv-with-big-picture-mode-beta/">Steam's Big Picture mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steamos/">SteamOS as a whole</a> have strived to make playing on a PC with a handheld controller into a more console-like experience.</p>

<p>Last week's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">announcement of the Asus Xbox ROG Ally</a> shows that Microsoft is leaning into this merger. The Windows 11-powered device promises to replace Windows' desktop icons and taskbar with a new full-screen "Xbox Experience for Handheld." The company says this will "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks" that take up RAM and computing resources on a full desktop Windows OS. That interface won't be exclusive to Asus' handheld, either; Microsoft has said it will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/full-screen-xbox-handheld-ui-is-coming-to-all-windows-pcs-starting-next-year/">start rolling out to other Windows devices "starting next year."</a></p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It's not ridiculous to think that the next Xbox console could be one of those Windows devices. A living-room-focused box running a modified version of that Xbox Experience for Handhelds (call it the "Xbox Experience for Consoles," if you like) would give living room gamers instant access to tens of thousands of games designed for Windows—plus thousands more coming out each year—with an interface and form factor familiar to living room gamers. That kind of software library would give a Windows-based Xbox an instant leg up on the more limited selection of ports available on competing consoles, especially if it also "maintains compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games," as Bond promised.</p>
<p>While Microsoft would likely build its own Windows-based Xbox hardware, it could also license its new console-ified Windows gaming interface to other hardware manufacturers interested in similar living room hardware. Microsoft is well-positioned to run a redo of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">Valve's abortive Steam Machines effort</a>, only this time without the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/">performance headaches</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/the-state-of-linux-gaming-in-the-steamos-era/">limited library of Linux ports</a> that plagued that effort.</p>
<p>True, a Windows-based Xbox console would mean Microsoft giving up the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/as-epic-attacks-apple-and-google-it-ignores-the-same-problems-on-consoles/">charge third-party developers a 30 percent fee</a> for the privilege of offering software on its current walled-garden console marketplace. And competing gaming PC manufacturers that currently partner with Microsoft might not be too happy with the Windows-maker encroaching on their space. But that all might be worth it to help cement Windows—and, in turn, Microsoft—as a central part of the home console gaming space.</p>

<h2>Reviving the brand</h2>
<p>A Windows-powered living room Xbox is just the kind of thing Microsoft needs to turn around its struggling home console brand. The Xbox One was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/report-ps4-has-now-sold-roughly-2-5-times-as-well-as-the-xbox-one/">outsold handily by Sony's PS4</a>, and sales of the Xbox Series S/X hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">have been cratering</a> in recent years. Seemingly acknowledging this, Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">started offering previous Xbox console exclusives</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">other platforms</a>, giving up the potential of system-selling exclusive games for the prospect of more software licensing fees.</p>

<p>On the PC side, though, Microsoft is still a force to be reckoned with. Practically every desktop or laptop gaming PC runs Windows by default, despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/intensely-demanding-aaa-game-cyberpunk-2077-is-coming-to-the-mac/">half-hearted</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/gaming-on-apple-platforms-is-set-for-some-big-changes-here-are-a-few/">efforts</a> by Apple to turn MacOS into a serious gaming platform. And while Valve's Linux-based SteamOS has created <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">a significant handheld gaming PC niche</a>—and is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">hinting at attempts to push into the gaming desktop space</a>—it does so only through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">a Proton compatibility layer</a>&nbsp;built on top of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/way-more-game-makers-are-working-on-pc-titles-than-ever-survey-says/">strong developer interest in Windows gaming</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft is already highlighting its software advantage over SteamOS, promoting the Xbox Experience for Handhelds' "aggregated game library" that can provide "access to games you can't get elsewhere" through multiple Windows-based game launchers. There's no reason to think that living room console players wouldn't also be interested in that kind of no-compromise access to the full suite of Windows gaming options.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been preparing the Xbox brand for this ultimate merger between PC and console gaming for years, too. While the name "Xbox" was once synonymous with Microsoft's console gaming efforts, that hasn't been true since the launch of "Xbox on Windows 10" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/xbox-on-windows-10-what-it-is-what-it-isnt-and-whats-missing/">in 2015</a> and the subsequent Windows Xbox app.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, offerings like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/xbox-play-anywhere-buy-the-game-once-play-on-xbox-one-and-pc-multiplayer-too/">Microsoft's "Play Anywhere" initiative</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/xbox-game-pass-is-coming-to-windows-10-but-many-questions-remain/">Xbox Game Pass for PC</a> have gotten players used to purchases and subscriptions giving them access to games on both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs (not to mention cloud streaming to devices like smartphones). If your living room Xbox console simply played Windows games directly (along with your Windows-based handheld gaming PC), this sort of "Play Anywhere" promise becomes that much simpler to pull off without any need for porting effort from developers.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of thoughts that ran through my mind when I heard Bond say yesterday that Xbox is "working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming" while "building you a gaming platform that's always with you so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device." That could simply be the kind of cross-market pablum <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/xbox-chief-we-want-to-regain-trust-more-than-we-want-to-beat-sony/">we're used to hearing from Microsoft</a>. Or it could be a hint of a new world where Microsoft finally fully leverages its Windows gaming dominance into a new vision for a living room Xbox console.</p>

                <p>Today, PlayStation has launched Climate Station, an interactive app for PS5 and PSVR 2 designed to help educate users on the effects of climate change. Using real-world scientific data and produced in collaboration with research and policymaking organizations, Climate Station aims to make knowledge about meteorological systems and human-driven impacts more accessible to wider audiences.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/18/climate-station-launches-today-on-ps5-and-ps-vr2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, PlayStation shared that the app provides a number of different experiences to allow users to dive into different aspects of the global climate. Weather Year, for instance, uses global weather data to create a model of the Earth complete with a year's worth of storms, weather patterns, wildfires, sea-ice changes, human behavior, and other events. Climate Station also surfaces historic observations about global temperature, greenhouse-gas emissions, and sea level, in addition to visualizing projections for the next 75 years as produced by scientific models.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZatuxtL47Cc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZatuxtL47Cc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PlayStation developed this app with an internal team in collaboration with the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, Berkeley Earth, and the Playing for the Planet Alliance. It uses public data and research from the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change, and the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p><p>Climate Station is an important effort to address one of the core challenges to making meaningful progress in mitigating climate change's harmful effects. Climate change is a complex, non-linear process with impacts that differ across time and space, making communication and education time-consuming and expensive. Further complicating matters, the scientific community's understanding of anthropogenic (human-driven) climate change has evolved significantly over the past 50 years. This discrepancy between scientific consensus and popular narratives can drive distrust and conflicts with climate science, disrupting vital efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and, eventually, mitigate and reverse the effects of our rapidly warming world.</p><p>In addition, despite <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/scientific-consensus/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">overwhelming scholarly consensus</a> and <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/reports" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">consistent evidence</a> from <a href="https://antarcticrcc-network.org/climate-monitoring/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worldwide research projects</a>, fundamental topics such as the existence of and threat posed by climate change have been repeatedly targeted by political polarization. The opposition to, marginalization of, and rejection of scholarly consensus and scientific research risks impeding or reversing climate-change mitigation. For example, the United States government has recently taken action to dismantle its climate change research capacity, including by <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">axing dozens of previously awarded grants</a>, removing <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/usda-orders-removal-climate-change-mentions-public-websites/story?id=118312216" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentions of climate change from public websites</a>, and proposing <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-seeks-end-climate-research-premier-u-s-climate-agency" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the elimination of climate research labs at NOAA and NASA</a>.</p><p>PlayStation's creation of Climate Station presents one possible way to bring more dynamic, scientifically oriented, and engaging education to the broader public, but it may itself be vulnerable to the dismantling of climate science. As stated on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002901/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its product page</a>, and like countless other educational projects, Climate Station relies on data provided by NOAA and NASA.

            <p>
Everybody loves palpating their turnips; just look at the success of Stardew Valley and its ilk for proof of that. But it turns out people <em>really</em> love some vegetable action, if the staggering success of Roblox game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> is any indication, given it's seemingly smashed through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s previous gargantuan record for most players at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Let's break out some numbers. According to <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/126884695634066/">third-party monitoring tools</a>, Grow a Garden - the specifics of which we'll get to shortly - soared past 16m concurrent players this weekend on Roblox (16,411,769 to be exact). By way of comparison, Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">announced record-breaking concurrents of 15.3m players</a> during its Marvel season finale event back in Covid-era 2020.
</p>
<p>
So what, you may be wondering, has garnered all this attention? Grow a Garden is, according to its <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden">official description</a> from developer The Garden Game, very much what it sounds like. It's a game of buying seeds, shoving them in the ground, then waiting for your blueberries, coconuts, daffodils etc. to grow - which they'll happily do whether you're in-game or offline.
</p>
<p>
After that, you can sell your massive produce for profit, purchasing more seeds or temporary boosts you'll need to slowly craft in real-time, then start the whole cycle over again. Frankly, absolutely nothing about it sounds like the sort of thing that might capture the imagination of 16m players all at once, but then I'm not a 13-year-old looking to do something mindless online with my friends after school. Also, there're <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-grow-a-garden-pets-eggs-how-to-get">Grow a Garden pets</a>, so maybe that's the appeal.
</p>
<p>
As to how Grow a Garden's impressive 16m concurrent users stacks up with other games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> currently holds the Steam record for most concurrent players, coming in at a comparatively paltry 3.3m, while it's nearest rival, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, barely squeaks over the 2.4m player threshold. In fact, Steam itself recently saw a concurrent high of 40m players, so Grow a Garden's 16m looks positively gargantuan given we're talking about a single game.
</p>
<p>
Whether all those players <em>should</em> be playing Roblox is another matter entirely, of course, given the game continues to be embroiled in controversy amid ongoing accusations of child safety failures. Developer Roblox Corporation last year announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">sweep of policy changes</a> - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">updated parental controls</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banning-social-hangouts-for-kids-under-13-due-to-user-behaviour-that-can-potentially-pose-a-risk">banning of social hangouts</a> for children under 13 - in a belated effort to improve things. Currently, Roblox Corporation is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-under-investigation-by-the-us-securities-and-exchange-commission">investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, possibly due to reports it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">previously misled investors by inflating player numbers</a>, although the reason hasn't been made public.

<p>A new month, a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> Booster Pack. That's a saying, right? It should be, because on 26th June 2025, we're getting another themed pack, and this time, it's all about Eevee.</p>
<p>Eevee Grove will be focusing on the adorable brown fluffy Pokémon and its eight evolutions — Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Glaceon, Leafeon, and Sylveon. Depending on your timezone, this is when the pack will be available to rip open over and over:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 11pm (Wed) PDT / 12am MDT / 1am CDT / 2am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 7am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 8am CEST / 9am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 4pm AEST</li></ul><p><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>These are fan-favourite 'mons, so we're sure lots of you will be very happy and scrambling to get some of those beautiful cards (Espeon and Umbreon are two of this writer's favourites, so she's considering a redownload right now...).</p>
<p>While many of the cards make a brief appearance in the trailer up top, we've got a more detailed look at a handful of them, including an ex, from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/its-a-cuteness-overload-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-upcoming-eevee-grove-expansion">the official website</a>.</p>

<p>The cards aren't the only star of the update, either. Soon enough, a new binder cover and display board will also be available, featuring all nine of the Eevee family.</p>
<p>This Booster Pack follows on from last month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-is-all-about-ultra-beasts">Ultra Beast-themed one</a>, which will still be around — just that Eevee is stealing the spotlight for now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/beat-saber-ends-support-for-playstation-versions-no-new-content-coming-multiplayer-shutting-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Beat Saber developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquires-beat-saber-studio-says-this-is-just-the-beginning/">Beat Games</a> has announced that it will no longer be releasing new Beat Saber content for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions of the game, which are essentially the PSVR and PS VR2 versions.</p>
<p>The game will still be available to purchase, and any already purchased content for those who already own the game and a litany of songs for it will still be able to play everything they've bought, but June 18, 2025, (which is today's date) is the final date for new content for Beat Saber on PS5 and PS4. Lady Gaga's <em>Abracadabra</em> will be the final song to be added to the Beat Saber library on PlayStation.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future and plan the next big leap for Beat Saber, we have made the decision to no longer release updates for PS4 and PS5 starting in June 2025,</em>" Beat Games began in a statement published to the <a href="https://x.com/BeatSaber/status/1935314587240276467">Beat Saber X account</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our passion for VR remains unwavering. We are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and what we can bring to Beat Saber fans who have been on this journey with us over the past 7 years</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We're grateful for the incredible support you've shown us over the years, and we're excited to share what the future holds for Beat Saber.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While no new content will be available for the game on PS5 and PS4 after today, players on PlayStation will still be able to play multiplayer from now until <strong>January 21, 2026.&nbsp;</strong>After that, multiplayer will no longer be available to PS5 and PS4 players.</p>
<p>For so many VR enthusiasts, Beat Saber has been the must-buy game with each new headset that has been released since the game first launched in 2018. It's arguably the most popular and recognizable VR game ever, and it only came to PlayStation's current generation of VR headset, the PS VR2, two short years ago in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/beat-saber-launches-on-ps-vr2-today-with-new-queen-music-pack/">May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It's been no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-production-reportedly-paused-until-sony-sells-current-backlog/">things aren't going amazingly well for PlayStation's VR efforts</a>, and it definitely isn't a good sign that what is arguably the most significant VR game to-date is turning away from the PS VR2 so quickly.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/686651/roottrees-ai-original-illustrator-replacement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-the-roottrees-are-dead-ditched-ai-and-became-a-hit.1222278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/686651/roottrees-ai-original-illustrator-replacement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Robin Ward was recovering from a broken arm when he fell in love with <em>The Roottrees are Dead</em>, a free browser game hosted on itch.io, an indie games salesfront. He reached out to its creator, Jeremy Johnston, and told him, “This should be a bigger deal than it is.” At the same time, Ward says, he “knew why” it couldn’t be.</p><p>The browser version of <em>The Roottrees are Dead</em> used AI-generated art for its images, a central part of the puzzle game that tasks players with investigating dozens of people and filling out its complex family tree. At the time, Steam, the biggest platform for PC games, did not allow the use of generative AI in games released using the storefront. In addition, Ward and Johnston agreed that they felt it was “unethical to sell artwork created in this way.”</p><p>Johnston had originally released the game for free, despite spending 11 months building it up from what was originally a Global Game Jam project cobbled together in less than a week in 2023. In the jam’s tight time constraints, and in a time before generative AI was quite so well known, he reached out to a friend who was “super into” using Midjourney and asked if he’d be willing to generate images based on prompts he had come up with for his puzzles.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: the original AI-generated artwork with a photographic style. Right: the illustrated replacement.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The images were far from perfect. Both Johnston and Ward point out a warped, staring image of a young girl in the original version of the game (<a href="https://jjohnstongames.itch.io/the-roottrees-are-dead">which is still available for free</a>) — Ward calls it “demonic.” Other portraits have the twisted hands that were a telltale giveaway of generative AI at the time.</p><p>But despite expanding the game for almost a year, adding to the story and puzzle aspects, Johnston says he “never really thought” to replace the art. Not being an artist himself, he was focused on the photographic quality of the existing artwork, and he knew he would never be able to afford to hire models and a cameraperson to recreate it.</p><p>And although he was putting a lot of work into the expanded version, he wasn’t expecting the reaction it would eventually get. “I’ve released other things — not games, necessarily, but things that I spent a lot of time and energy on, and then they came out and no one cared,” he says. So although he spent a lot of time on <em>Roottrees</em>, he did not want to invest money he was never expecting to get back.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: a particularly cursed AI-generated child. Right: the vastly improved illustrated replacement.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>When he did release the itch.io version of <em>Roottrees</em>, though, it was surprisingly popular. It spread on forums and Reddit, and it received some attention in the games press. He did not charge for it, on account of the AI artwork, although he did include a donation link and says he made around $2,000-$3,000 from more than 10,000 players.</p><p>And one of those players was Ward. After reaching out to Johnston, they agreed that Ward would reprogram the game and hire an illustrator to replace the AI artwork and get it ready for a Steam release. The illustrator he brought on, Henning Ludvigsen, says he used the AI art as a kind of concept sketch. Ludvigsen then did his own research into the era and style the picture was supposed to evoke, eventually making almost 40 illustrations across nearly a year of work.</p><p>“I’m not a big fan of generative AI,” he says, saying his peers in the illustration industry have seen a reduction in work, particularly concept artists. “[Companies] kind of skip that step now [using AI], which I think is not great.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: a composite AI illustration of the Roottrees. Right: Ludvigsen could create more consistent characters who actually look like they’re in the same world.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>When it comes to finished products, though, he still sees generative AI as “not doing that well in general” among players. Large video game companies like Take Two Interactive have noted that players tend to not only avoid games that use AI but also react negatively to them online and in ratings,<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/take-two-review-bombs-gta-nfl-2k"> calling it</a> a potential avenue for “loss of players, revenues…and reputation harm.” Johnston mentions the case of Cyan Worlds, the developer behind Myst,<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/firmament-ai-generated-content/"> receiving backlash</a> for using “AI assisted content” like texture assets in its latest game.</p><p><em>The Roottrees are Dead</em> seemed to skirt these issues by being transparent about its use upfront, as well as releasing for free, Johnston says. Ward also points out that “in this case, it’s the case of ‘there would be no game’ versus ‘there is a game.’” Johnston agrees that without the use of AI-generated artwork, the initial version would never have been released, meaning the eventual full version with Ludvigsen’s work in it would also never have existed. Ludvigsen himself says he “really enjoyed” replacing the illustrations, given he’s “not a big fan of” AI art generation in general. </p><p>“I think some people would say, ‘Well, I would prefer that there is no game in this case,’ and I think they’re entitled to their opinion,” Ward says, citing the<a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about"> environmental concerns</a> and the scrapping of artists’ work for training corpuses as potential arguments for that approach. “But I ended up playing something that I really loved,” he says. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: the AI-generated original. Right: the illustrated version more clearly reflects the setting of the photograph.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The game was released on Steam in January 2025. “The vast majority of people are like, ‘I’m very happy you got rid of the AI,’” Ward says. Although some have said they prefer the more photographic quality of the generated art, Ludvigsen’s work is undeniably an upgrade, from the untwisted fingers to the increased consistency in design for characters who appear in multiple photographs, which makes some puzzles more understandable.</p><p><em>The Roottrees are Dead </em>is now a critical and commercial success, which would not have happened without both generative AI and a human artist. Both Ward and Johnston note that the game took an unusual route to its current state. But with the increasing prevalence of AI tools, it’s possible more games will end up on the same path.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a universe primed for big-budget swings after the superhero franchise has become such a cultural phenomenon in the wake of the MCU, but after years of big, unpredictable projects, it’s nice to go back to something that feels more like the old-school classics of the pre-MCU days than something that’s trying to bring heaps of glossy, prestige gravitas to a console near you. That vibrant, old-school appeal is exactly what I got when I played <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> at Summer Game Fest.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196053" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Stomp Your Foes &amp; Look Fly Doing It With This Marvel Snap Deck" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="138" data-playlist="196053,197586,197585" data-current="196053"><div><p>Stomp Your Foes &amp; Look Fly Doing It With This Marvel Snap Deck</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196053/196053_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196053/196053_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196053/196053_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196053/196053_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21582.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Cosmic Invasion </em>is a cooperative beat-em-up made by Tribute Games, the studio behind some great retro throwback games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a></span><em>, </em>and that’s currently also working on the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-ex-netflix-tribute-games-anamanaguchi-1851783893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-ex-netflix-tribute-games-anamanaguchi-1851783893"><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em></a></span>. Marvel beat-em-ups definitely had a moment in the ‘90s, with standouts like the <em>X-Men</em> arcade game. It’s been a while since we got one as modern as <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> feels, though it draws more heavily from the classic aesthetics of old Marvel comics than from anything you’ll see on a theater screen. Given the team’s pedigree, it’s no surprise that its take on Marvel is as stylish and satisfying as it is. <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>has you and a friend each pick two heroes to swap between on the fly as you knock around alien forces invading Earth. In the roughly 30 minutes I played, I chose to fight as Captain America and Wolverine. The two heroes specialize primarily in close-quarters combat, but America’s Ass could also perform some ranged attacks by throwing his shield. Wolfie’s attacks were far more vicious. I could latch onto enemies and gut them with my claws, almost like a grappler character in a fighting game. Those distinct differences, even between characters you’d guess would have similar playstyles, are what keep <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>from becoming a monotonous chore.</p><p>The beat-em-up genre is always toeing the line between mindless brawling and cathartic mayhem, and in my limited time with it, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>kept me on my toes. Its waves of enemies are varied enough that a simple one-button combo wasn’t always going to do the trick, and each time I played as a different character, my strategies changed up pretty substantially. When I played as Spider-Man in a second run, the hero’s webswinging helped me get across the battlefield more quickly and deliver a devastating blow to enemies on the other side of the screen. Playing as flying characters like the weather-manipulating Storm made taking down airborne enemies a breeze, where land-locked heroes might have struggled with those pests. </p><p>Playing alongside a competent teammate also kept things interesting, as my player two and I would often juggle enemies back and forth between us like we were hackeysacking them, sometimes into environmental hazards like holes in the floor. Every so often, I would find myself falling into a rhythm of the same combos and strategies, but then a cool, unscripted moment like this would bring me back. Swapping between heroes at any time also kept me alert. If I started to get too comfortable with Captain America, I could switch to Wolverine and do something a little different. I enjoy beat-em-ups, but the genre has a lot of repetitive pitfalls that games in it can easily fall into. Thankfully, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>has a lot of systems in place to try and alleviate those as much as possible.</p><p>While yes, I’m looking forward to the big stuff Marvel is putting out in the video game space, it’s also nice to play something a bit more simple and evocative of classic comic-book stories, and which employs a vibrant aesthetic that sometimes feels like it’s missing from most modern Marvel. Tribute Games is great at capturing a moment in time, and <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>is the kind of palate-cleansing throwback that reminds you that Marvel wasn’t always the biggest-budget entertainment property on the planet; once upon a time, you were more likely to see Captain America beating up some baddies as you fought alongside a friend at an arcade cabinet than to see him onscreen at your local multiplex. I’m looking forward to seeing if the game holds up over several hours when it launches on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This game has a much wackier tone than <em>Control</em>. Whereas <em>Control</em> had protagonist Jesse Faden explore the psychological and supernatural elements of the Oldest House, here you and some friends play as a bunch of no-name workers in <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> tasked with responding to emergencies and clearing out enemies called the Hiss while fixing up various contraptions. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,195922,195928" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Together, a squad of three must tackle the game’s various objectives and level up skills to rise through the ranks. Here are some tips to complete the tasks on your to-do list and impress your boss.</p><h2 id="h141522"><a id=""></a>Avoid playing solo</h2><p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> surprisingly has quite a lot in common with <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. You can play in squads up to three, and both games really encourage communication and coordination. They both even have no in-game voice chat! <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> at least has cross-platform play, though.</p><p>While the game can be played solo, it’s much more fun with other players at your side. It can be very difficult to complete certain tasks like fixing machines and fighting off enemies simultaneously. Having teammates means that you can also diversify and synergize the different abilities that the game’s Crisis Kits offer, leading to faster and successful outcomes</p><p>Going solo means you’re much more likely to just get downed. Speaking of being downed, your teammates can revive you and you won’t have to waste a life by respawning if you were playing solo.</p><h2 id="h141523"><a id=""></a>Familiarize yourself with the Crisis Kits</h2><p>Crisis Kits are Firebreak’s form of classes. So far, there are three: Fix, Jump, and Splash.</p><p><strong>The Fix Kit is a close-range melee fighting specialist who comes equipped with a giant wrench and shotgun to fight off enemies</strong>. The wrench does a pathetic amount of damage, but it can be used to fix machines with a wrench icon like showers and skip a mini-game. Fix Kits also come with a turret and the AI16 Piggy Altered Augment that conjures up a coin twister to hit enemies.</p><p><strong>The Jump Kit focuses more on enemy crowd control and management.</strong> Its giant Electro-Kinetic Charge Impactor lets it quickly jump start certain machines such as showers and ammo closets that can help your teammates in a pinch. This Crisis Kit comes with a boombox that draws in enemies before blowing up, as well as the AI19 Garden Gnome Altered Augment that calls forth bolts of lightning to rain down on enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-recommend-id="image://4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Splash Kit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Splash Kit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-recommend-id="image://4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Splash Kit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>The Splash Kit plays more like a typical support class with its water-based abilities.</strong> The Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector can rinse teammates and get rid of negative status effects like fire. It can also inflict the “wet” status effect on enemies, which synergizes incredibly well with Jump Kits and their ability to shock them with the Electro-Kinetic Charge. This Kit also carries the AI44 Teapot Altered Augment that heats up water and fires them at enemies, scalding them for extra damage.</p><h2 id="h141524"><a id=""></a>Familiarize yourself with the different Job Sites</h2><p>So far, the game has five different Job Sites. Each contains their own unique settings and objectives. Knowing which job you’re taking on can inform what kind of Kits to bring along to efficiently finish your tasks.</p><figure id="" data-id="f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-recommend-id="image://f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different jobs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows different jobs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-recommend-id="image://f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different jobs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hot Fix has your squad fixing fans and making sure the furnace doesn’t burn the entire place down. Paper Chase requires your squad to destroy a bunch of sticky notes scattered throughout the entire area. The Splash Kit does wonders in both sites, as the former will be VERY hot and you’ll likely suffer from burns, which a Splash Kit can help relieve. In the latter, Splash Kits can make the sticky notes wet, and the Jump Kit can destroy them by shocking them.</p><p>Ground Control is much more straightforward, where you’ll just have to kill a bunch of insects to drop their pearls, which then need to be transferred. Frequency Shift is also quite straightforward. Pink goo has infested the entire area and your teammates must get rid of it. However, you have to be careful as the goo can explode and hurt you.</p><p>The final Job Site is Freezer Duty, which sees your squad turning on heaters to melt down the ice covering the area. In particular, the Jump Kit is helpful here as it can quickly jump start the heaters.</p><h2 id="h141525"><a id=""></a>Collect Research Samples and Lost Assets regularly</h2><p>Throughout various Job Sites, you’ll come across Lost Assets and Research Samples around the area, especially on the ground. You’ll want to pick them up, as they’re needed to unlock perks and upgrade your tools. </p><p>Lost Assets look like stationary, such as clipboards, paper, and folders, while Research Samples usually look like piles of colored powder. <strong>This is the game’s form of permanent progression</strong> as you prepare to tackle harder difficulties and continue through higher Clearance, Threat, and Corruption levels.</p><figure id="" data-id="1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-recommend-id="image://1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows various perks in FBC: Firebreak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows various perks in FBC: Firebreak." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-recommend-id="image://1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows various perks in FBC: Firebreak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lost Assets can be found at any of the Job Sites, but specific Research Samples can only be found at certain Job Sites. Additionally, you’ll need to turn on at least one level of Corruption for any Research Samples to show up at all.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hot Fix has Whispering Ash samples</li><li>Paper Chase has Viscous Strip samples</li><li>Ground Control has Achromatic Sand samples</li><li>Frequency Shift has Resonant Glob samples</li><li>Freezer Duty has Numbed Splinters samples</li></ul><p>Make sure to actually finish the Job and extract from the elevator after your objective is done, as you won’t be able to take anything with you if you fail the entire mission.</p><hr><p><br><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is now available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's upcoming 11.2 update is bringing with it one unexpected addition popularized by From Software RPGs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-83346">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>--asynchronous social features.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a>, Blizzard will add new social functions to Delves, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">MMORPG's latest endgame mode that can be played solo or with small groups</a>. Like in Elden Ring or Dark Souls, players within a Delve will be able to see remnants of other players who have journeyed to the instance, see markers where a player may have died from a strong pack of enemies or hidden trap, and leave helpful messages for others to read while inside. I'm sure these messages will always be 100% serious.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an addition players may not have known they wanted, but one that makes perfect sense and should make Delves feel more alive than they currently do. WoW is a MMO, after all, even as it continues to offer new ways to achieve endgame goals entirely solo. Adding asynchronous social elements to the game's main endgame mode for solo players helps to further reinforce the idea that WoW is a game played alongside millions of other players, even for those players who largely stick to themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders said in an interview with GameSpot it's important that players are able to progress at their own pace in Delves and play with the group size that they want, whether that be solo or with a few friends. The new asynchronous social features in Delves are there to support that flexibility, as Blizzard believes the mode has been a huge success and doesn't want to change what's working.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a way of getting back to some of MMO's roots," Sanders said. "Of knowing that other players are around you, in a way, without necessarily grouping players up with other players they might not want to play with…This is a way of capturing some of that magic of MMOs, of seeing other players throughout the environment, seeing memories of where they may have messed up and gotten splattered by a trap or something, without necessarily impacting what we think has been really positive and successful about the feature."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Delve social features are just the tip of the iceberg for the Ghosts of K'aresh update, which in many ways serves as a sequel of sorts to events and lore first introduced in the game's The Burning Crusade expansion. It will transport players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals to stop a cosmic-level threat from returning.

                <p>Blizzard has lifted the veil on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next major update, and it's a surprising sequel to the MMORPG's first expansion, as players journey to the shattered homeworld of the mysterious Ethereals.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, brings to mind the Legion expansion's Shadows of Argus update, which also took players to a destroyed planet that has long existed in the lore. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will travel to the Ethereal former home in an effort to stop the resurrection of Dimensius, a powerful void-lord responsible for the destruction of K'aresh and who players may remember dispatching a fragment of as part of a lengthy quest chain in The Burning Crusade back in 2007. Turns out Dimensius wasn't defeated for good and is back in 11.2 with a major glow-up, sounding and looking far more like a world-destroying entity compared to their <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensius_the_All-Devouring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original oversized voidwalker look</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ethereals, strange energy beings who could be found throughout TBC's continent of Outland, have gone on to be a fan-favorite group within WoW's fantasy universe since their introduction close to two decades ago. More recently in The War Within, the Ethereals have had a larger role to play in the MMO's ongoing story of Xal'atath and her powerful void-infused artifact, the Dark Heart. Speaking with GameSpot, associate art director Tina Wang said the team enjoyed looking back at how the Ethereals have been represented in the past in order to inform the look and feel of Ghosts of K'aresh.</p><p dir="ltr">"We really love the old themes from Burning Crusade, the key Ethereal elements, the mana forges, the Eco-Domes, the glowing pink pipes," Wang said. "I think folks who remember and look back at the Ethereals fondly will see a lot of elements that they really connect with."</p><p dir="ltr">To help navigate K'aresh, players will gain a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Reshii Wraps, that will allow players to "phase dive" into an energy form similar to that of the Ethereals. This lets players see the world through a new lens and will allow access to new activities on K'aresh like Warrants, where players will help track down special enemies for lucrative rewards. The Reshii Wraps will also be used for unique mechanics within the update's new endgame content. One example of using the Reshii Wraps given by lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders is how players in the new raid, Manaforge: Omega, will need to swap to their energy form in order to dodge a giant laser that could wipe out the group.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000" data-ratio="0.56239870340357" data-width="1851" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000"></a><figcaption>The Reshii Wraps will allow players to phase dive into an energy form to complete new activities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another major open-world activity coming as part of the update is called Ecological Succession. Players may remember the large Eco-Domes in TBC's Netherstorm region that helped to define the zone's look, where the Ethereals looked to create new, enclosed ecosystems amidst a backdrop of destruction. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will get to go hands on and help manage their own Eco-Dome by partnering with the Broker Ve'nari, who will ask for players to retrieve plants and animals from older WoW zones to bring back to the Eco-Domes in an effort to kickstart life once more. It's part of the WoW's team's efforts to take advantage of the huge amount of content already within the MMO, Wang said.</p><p dir="ltr">Assistant lead quest designer Stephanie Yoon said progressing Ecological Succession and its storyline will take multiple weeks. It's a slow burn at first, Yoon said, as ecological change doesn't happen overnight. Over time, however, as players introduce new life and meet new characters, the Eco-Dome will change and the fruits of players' labors will become more obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">"When I first saw the end of Ecological Succession, I teared up," Yoon said. "So I hope it impacts players as much as it did me."</p><p dir="ltr">A new zone isn't complete without a new raid and dungeon, and 11.2 will have those too. The Manageforge: Omega raid will see players confronting Dimensius, who Blizzard described as the biggest raid boss in WoW history. How big, exactly? According to Blizzard, the new version of Dimensius is equivalent to the size of Stormwind itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players will be fighting against this void-lord, this being the size of Stormwind city, and they'll see him from different perspectives," Sanders said. "They'll be diving from thousands of feet away against lasers and thrown planets, and they'll also be fighting him up close and personal as he's smashing his fists down on the platform next to you that are the size of a school bus. It's going to be an epic encounter."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002"></a><figcaption>Ghosts of K'aresh's pink Eco-Domes will be a familiar site to those who played The Burning Crusade.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the dungeon front, Eco-Dome Al'dani is a new three-boss instance, one where the dungeon's story will actually take place canonically after the events of the raid and dive into how the Ethereals are looking to sustain life on their home planet. For the more solo-minded players, there's a new Delve as well, one that will actually return adventurers to the Azure Vault in the Dragon Isles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wows-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Delves are additionally receiving new souls-like social functions</a> like player ghosts, death markers, and the ability to leave messages for other Delvers to see.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that the update is all about the Ethereals and the Brokers, the Shadowlands mega-dungeon Tazavesh, the Veiled Market will return for The War Within Season 3's Mythic+ dungeon pool, split into two instances. Tazavesh will be joined by the new Eco-Dome Al'dani as well as Halls of Atonement from Shadowlands and four War Within instances. On the PvP side of the season, K'aresh itself will have a specific PvP zone, Vanquisher's Wake, earmarked for open-world PvP where players will be able to complete their weekly spark quest to earn rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't yet revealed when WoW's Ghosts of K'aresh update will release, but it will likely be available for testing on the game's public test realm in the near future. As for what else is coming to WoW in 2025, Blizzard previously announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">Legion Remix event for later in the year</a>, and players are hoping to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">WoW's player housing system</a> as well.

		<p>The Nintendo Switch is many things, but a serious fighting game platform is not one of them. That’s not to say there aren’t amazing fighting game experiences, as proven by the existence of titles like the Capcom Fighting Collection series, and there have been regular ports of premier fighting titles like Mortal Kombat, albeit vastly downscaled to fit them on there. Outside of Super Smash Brothers, though, Switches are not regularly seen at fighting game tournaments. Heck, there are barely any high-quality fight sticks for the system, relying instead on adaptors to make things compatible.</p>
<p>That all looks like it’s about to change though, with the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2, and Street Fighter 6: Year 1+2 Fighters Edition as a launch title. Not only is this the full Street Fighter 6 experience, it’s also rated as tournament legal by Capcom, making this portable version of the game a genuine challenger.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h2gsKAoW0sg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you’ve spent time with Street Fighter 6, you’ll already know that this sits handily amongst the current crop of best fighting games. It rewrote the pervading negative narrative that circled Street Fighter V, as well as introducing a host of new features to the series which now feel essential. It is a great game, and two years down the line, with the second batch of fighters having just dropped, it’s hit a new peak.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version then immediately sets the tone by including all the previously released fighters, taking the roster to an exceedingly healthy 26 fighters. Besides that, it also benefits from two years’ worth of updates and content drops, and, if anything, loading up Street Fighter 6 at launch on Switch 2 is daunting, giving you so many possibilities, and so many characters to choose from, that it’s hard to know where to start.</p>


<p>The best starting point for most people will be World Tour. Here, you create your own fighter, designing them from the ground up, and then taking them out into the semi open-world to find fame and fortune by running up to people in the street and getting into a brawl with them. For all that it occasionally feels wrong beating up an unassuming old lady, this mode lets you craft and create a unique fighter, building up their personal repertoire of moves by training under each of the established fighters from the series, and it’s just a brilliant twist on the established Street Fighter one-on-one mechanics.</p>
<p>Some may wish it was more like Netherealms’ cinematic singleplayer stories like those found in Mortal Kombat or Injustice 2, rather than a Yakuza-lite brawler, but I love the player agency you have in World Tour, and there’s some serious longevity and customisation for your playable avatar to keep you coming back.</p>

<p>However, in docked mode, the Switch 2 version of the game doesn’t perform as well as the PlayStation 5 or PC editions here, with the open world and emergent battles proving pretty challenging for Nintendo’s new handheld. The frame rate takes significant hits while you’re running around, and that’s with vastly reduced animations on distant figures, or more often than not, characters just popping into existence much closer than you’d expect.</p>
<p>That, combined with the 30fps fights in this mode, take the shine off what is one of the biggest draws of this game. Surprisingly, things are better in hanheld mode, with a reduced resolution helping to keep things smoother, if not perfect. Even so, it’s still a hell of a lot of fun – I’ve spent the entire day today running around in it – and if you don’t have access to the other versions, you likely won’t mind too much.</p>

<p>The Battle Hub is Street Fighter 6’s online component. The twist here is that it’s one giant lobby that you explore in 3D, running up to potential opponents playing at arcade machines, while also being able to watch fights, customise your avatar and more. The Switch 2 version is fully crossplay compatible with the other versions of the game, but that’s a bit of a blessing and a swift kick of a curse. The combination of reduced access to competitive Fight Sticks and Nintendo resolutely steering away from an actual D-pad on the Joy Con 2, make this far from an even playing field, even if the bouts themselves are fundamentally mechnically the same.</p>
<p>You can choose to disable crossplay if you want your online fighting to be limited to Switch 2 players, but then you’re severely limiting your potential opponents. When playing with Joy-Con 2, you can opt for Street Fighter 6’s Modern Controls which make things more accessible, giving players access to set combos with a simplified button layout, but fighting game fans and long-time players will want the full-fat experience. That is here, and the new Pro Controller 2 has a better, more defined D-pad than its predecessor, but there’s a number of ifs, buts and maybes to actually interacting with this game.</p>

<p>Street Fighter 6: Year 1+2 Fighters Edition is, in and of itself, an awesome port of the original. It’s attractive, with clear, sharp visuals, and the mainline battles are brought to you in smooth 60fps. Performance is choppier during the World Tour mode, with 30fps combat feeling decidedly less polished than those elsewhere, and hanging out in the Battle Hub can bring the odd judder or two. Crucially, there’s no sign of that during online battles, or in the game’s traditional offline modes like Arcade and Vs, but there are signs of where Capcom has had to make cuts to bring it to the less powerful Switch 2 hardware.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6: Year 1+2 Fighters Edition is an impressive port, but it almost feels like its for the wrong hardware. As the system matures, and as third party providers give us Joy-Con 2 with better D-Pads, and maybe Hori, Turtle Beach or Qanba bless us with a new fight stick or two, perhaps that feeling will change. In the here and now, I don’t expect to see many Switch 2 players making it to Evo or the Pro Tour, but they’ll definitely be having fun in the meantime.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-into-early-access-in-summer-2025-major-playtest-update-coming-july-2/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-into-early-access-in-summer-2025-major-playtest-update-coming-july-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has narrowed the release window for Skate's early access launch, which is now due to arrive sometime in summer 2025. The company also <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-three">showcased</a> the next major update that'll be arriving for players who are already taking to the streets of San Vansterdam, which will provide a whole new look to the city compared to the one players have had in the playtest so far.</p>
<p>Update 0.27.0 arrives on July 2, 2025, and adds a great deal of detail to the city and environments that players will skate through. It also includes more than 140 new challenges for players to test their skills and new character customization features for players to really start expressing themselves in this new Skate, even in the insider playtest.</p>
<p>All of which is shown in the video below, through a few small clips of gameplay from the insider playtest, with players skating around the new San Vansterdam with the 0.27 update live.</p>
<p><iframe title="July Playtest Gameplay Preview | skate." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CA3z4t8iMRU?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you've not yet signed up for the playtest and want to try the game before it launches in early access sometime this summer, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">make sure to sign up</a> before <strong>June 27, 2025</strong>, as registrations for the playtest will be closed after that date.</p>
<p>The before-and-after photos shared by EA, showing how the playtest will change, in environmental detail alone, are another example of just how close we're getting to the game's launch, with players finally no longer skating in mostly grey environments.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>EA also confirmed that Skate can be wish-listed on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, so players keen on jumping into the new game can be notified when pre-orders go live.</p>
<p>We're so close to the return of the Skate series, an event that many players and fans of the original trilogy didn't think would happen. It'll be interesting to see how the full game resonates with players, and how EA and Full Circle continue to respond to player feedback as the early access period goes on, which, as of now, doesn't seem like it'll be that long, if the full game is still due out by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">April 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>If you're reading this, it may be too late. The mysterious genius behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s most popular flying car mod has just released its first update in a good while, alongside a fresh work that removes the speed limits the game applies to all of its vehicles.</p>
<p>It looks like the perfect recipe for my next trip to Night City ending with an shattered engine block wedged halfway up a skyscraper, and Keanny Reevhand standing next to it tutting.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5208?tab=description">Let There Be Flight</a> by modder Jack Humbert, it arrived in September 2022, swapped the wheels of Cyberpunk's cars for working thrusters, and left plenty of folks wondering why dystopian futures are ever allowed to omit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O7qff_ezFE">flying cars</a>. After all, when the world's gone down the corporate tubes, surely you need to balance that out by letting people dream of drifting a futuristic VW golf ten thousand feet above the pavement?</p>
<p>I digress. Humbert's just updated Let There Be Flight for the first time since <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5208?tab=logs">June 2023</a>, which is welcome news since folks have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunk2077mods/comments/1lc5xj5/let_there_be_flight_back_2025/">reported issues</a> getting it to run with the game's more recent patches.</p>
<p>"I've been rewriting some parts of LTBF to better use in-game systems, and this has allowed for better state control of flight and input contexts, enabling native vehicle combat (handheld and vehicle-mounted) while flying," he wrote, "This should also make it more compatible with other vehicle-based mods (in theory), but I have yet to try things out on a wide scale...I have lots of ideas that I'd like to see implemented, and will try to get them finished to a point that you can at least try them out here."</p>
<p>Nice, but here's the kicker, alongside this update Humbert's uploaded his first new mod since 2022. It's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155?tab=description">Vehicle Speed Unlimiter</a> and gets rid of the automatic limits the game puts on car movement speed - as far as I can tell, the ones you'd bang your head against even if you modded or file tweaked a car to go beyond its base top speed value.</p>
<p>The mod's description says speeds above 400mph will be possible, and to make clear what that's done, a user with the handle Oranje3 has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=15695671">said</a> they've already used it to get a modded car up to 1222mph, and posted <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155?tab=images#lg=3&amp;slide=0">a screenshot</a> to back that assertion up.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I now have a new mission in life. I'll have to find the time to get my Cyberpunk load order back to working order since I've not done a playthrough in a little bit, but if I do soon, I'll definitely be trying to better that speed. In a flying car too, assuming that doesn't prove a barrier to engaging warp speed.</p>
<p>If you want to try Vehicle Speed Unlimiter, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, while Let There Be Flight requires that plus <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4575">Input Loader</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">Redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s how to make it happen.</p><h2 id="h35934"><a id=""></a>How to set a passcode on your Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p>When you’re ready to set a passcode on your Nintendo Switch 2, you’ll first need to boot up the console. I mean, that should be pretty obvious. Hurry up. I want to get back to playing <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p>Click the “Settings” icon on your Nintendo Switch 2 home screen, then scroll down and select “System”. Next, scroll through the options until you reach a setting that says “System Lock”. Click this setting to be introduced to a screen where you can create a 4-8 digit passcode.</p><p>The default method of input is using the joysticks for some reason, but you can hold the “+” button down to switch to a keypad layout if you’d prefer. I’d recommend doing so, as entering the numbers with the joystick can be kind of finicky. </p><figure id="" data-id="bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-recommend-id="image://bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A setting in the Switch 2's system menus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A setting in the Switch 2's system menus." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-recommend-id="image://bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A setting in the Switch 2's system menus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Either way, once you’ve entered the passcode and confirmed it, accessing your Nintendo Switch 2 from Sleep Mode will always require you to unlock it first. Now your kids can’t get on there and overwrite your save files and max out your credit cards buying <em>Fortnite</em> skins — or whatever kids do these days.</p><figure id="" data-id="9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-recommend-id="image://9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The lock screen for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The lock screen for the Switch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-recommend-id="image://9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The lock screen for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you ever want to remove the passcode, return to the “System Lock” setting and toggle it off. You’ll have to enter the passcode to turn the feature off, though. If you’ve forgotten the passcode, you can press “+” to sign into your Nintendo Account to unlock the system instead. </p><p>Oh, and don’t forget you should share the code with any other adults you feel comfortable using your console — but don’t give it to strangers. You know better than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_4_Reloaded">What to expect from Season 4 Reloaded</h2><h3 id="Two_new_weapons">Two new weapons</h3><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded adds two new weapons to Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision announced the Olympia, a double-barrel shotgun, and the pickaxe melee weapon will arrive sometime during this midseason update.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092"></a><figcaption>Pickaxe melee weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Two_new_events">Two new events</h3><p dir="ltr">Each seasonal update usually includes a few events. So far, the only ones confirmed for Season 4 Reloaded are two community-based Zombies events. These are vaguely described by Activision, so it's not yet clear how these event or reward systems work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>King of the Dead</strong> runs from June 26 to July 3. For this, players must eliminate zombies in any Zombie mode to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Master of Grief</strong> runs from July 10-17. This event is described as collecting Essence in Grief in order to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h3><h4 id="More_multiplayer_maps">More multiplayer maps</h4><p dir="ltr">For Black Ops 6 multiplayer, the Season 4 Reloaded adds two more maps: A brand-new map called Eclipse and a remaster of Fringe from Black Ops 3.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103"></a><figcaption>Eclipse multiplayer map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision recently confirmed that next season will bring the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final Zombies map for Black Ops 6</a>. This means players won't get a new map for the midseason update, but there will be new limited-time modes for Zombies.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="New_Zombies_LTMs">New Zombies LTMs</h4><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Starting Room LTM</strong> is inspired by the starting room of the classic Moon map from Black Ops 1, where players are limited to only a small section of the map. This mode will be available on all Black Ops 6 maps, with each one giving a limited area for players to survive as long as they can.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Abomination Challenge LTM</strong> is vaguely described by Activision as taking place on "a warped version of Liberty Falls" and players must hunt down and eliminate an ultra-powered-up Abomination.</p><p dir="ltr">Grief mode launched at the start of Season 4, and Treyarch confirmed the mode is permanent. The latest patch notes for Black Ops 6 included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-improves-grief-mode-and-returns-disabled-skin/1100-6532410/">several improvements to Grief</a>, and the developer revealed more updates are currently in testing, so it's likely Season 4 Reloaded could include even more quality-of-life changes the mode.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h3><h4 id="More_Ranked_Play">More Ranked Play</h4><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded returns Resurgence Ranked Play to Rebirth Island. The competitive mode will exist alongside Ranked Play on Verdansk and feature a separate ranking system and rewards, so players can progress through both ladders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185"></a><figcaption>Resurgence Ranked Play on Rebirth Island</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to sweaty Ranked Play modes, Season 4 Reloaded includes the Havoc Royale LTM and Resurgence Casual.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Additional_game_modes">Additional game modes</h4><p dir="ltr">The Havoc Royale limited-time mode is described as chaotic 15-minute matches with 44 players on a limited section of Verdansk. Each circle collapse will include a different game modifier to affect the match, and players will need to adapt fast to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">With the success of casual BR modes on Verdansk, Season 4 Reloaded adds the Resurgence Casual mode, bringing bots to Rebirth Island. This mode will still follow the normal Resurgence gameplay, but the lobby is made up of a mix of real players and bots.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The publisher has also confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/" data-ref-id="1100-6532517">Black Ops 7 is a boots-on-the-ground game</a>, squashing the rumors of potential jetpack or wall-running mechanics.</p>

            <p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> patch has removed the ability to damage other players in PvP by ramming them with your vehicle, killing the popular PvP tactic.</p>
<p>Tactic is perhaps too strong a word. Hordes of players in Dune: Awakening's Deep Desert end game zone were tracking solos down in orniphopters. If they found them in an orniphopter of their own, they'd shoot them down with missiles.</p>
<p>The real problem emerged if they were on foot. Prior to the patch, if you were hit by a orniphopter you'd be knocked down into a revive state. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">These pilots then waited for you to self-revive, then crushed you again</a>, leading to a loop of roadkillification.</p>

<p>This trend didn't go down particularly well, with creative director Joel Bylos popping onto Reddit to say the team were working on a fix. This appears to be that fix, and it's going down well among the community. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lebm3l/comment/myggtgi/?context=3">Ciyeelo on Reddit</a> responded with: "Thank fucking god because so-called beta testers Guild with 🤓 10k hours of game play was abusing this Day 3 of the early release."</p>
<p>Others still desired additional changes. A popular sentiment is that the vehicles themselves should take damage when taking major bumps. As Illustrious-Hawk-898 puts it: "Being able to ride a buggy off the rim of the Hagga Rift to the bottom, and not taking damage; or flying a thopter into a wall at 160km are some of the most immersion breaking aspects of this game".</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the future of Dune: Awakening? Well, big groups of orniphopter gangs will likely still remain a powerful threat. Even if they can't ram you, five of them rushing you all at once is a little insurmountable. However this change should allow players to line up shots with Lasguns and Rocket Launchers a little easier, especially once more players get their hands on the tier six materials required to create them.</p>
<p>These twists and turns are to be expected in a large PvP setting like the one present in Dune: Awakening's end game. If it sounds like something you're interested in, why not check out Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>! It covers the end game, describing it as a "weekly political boxing match that I've found endlessly captivating".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though its publisher doesn't fill us with confidence</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>A new game based on the enduring <strong>Goosebumps</strong> book series has been announced for the Switch.</p>
<p>Launching in <strong>August 2025</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/goosebumps_terror_in_little_creek">Goosebumps: Terror in Little Creek</a> sees you take on the role of a teenager "caught in a town of nightmares", in which creatures and locations based on R.L. Stine's creations will look to thwart your progress at every turn.</p>
<p>Standard editions will cost £34.99/€39.99 at launch, while an exclusive digital edition called the <strong>Frightmare Edition</strong> will come in at £39.99/€49.99. This comes with the game itself along with "five in-game wearable masks, five slingshot skins with special trail VFX, a Concept Art Viewer, and a 3D Model Viewer featuring in-game characters, monsters and more".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The debut trailer doesn't look <em>terrible</em> (though it doesn't look amazing, either), but then we clocked who's actually publishing this thing: GameMill Entertainment. You know, the team behind travesties such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/skull_island_rise_of_kong">Skull Island: Rise of Kong</a>. It's not a team known for its high quality, let's put it that way.</p>
<p>Still, we'll reserve judgement for now. Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- SURVIVE AN ORIGINAL GOOSEBUMPS STORY</strong> – Experience a brand-new Goosebumps mystery, crafted exclusively for the game. Encounter fresh terrors inspired by the book series while uncovering the supernatural secrets hidden within Little Creek.</p>
<p>- <strong>EXPLORE THE HORRIFYING UNKNOWN</strong> – Traverse fog-filled streets, creep around abandoned theaters, and sneak through dark libraries teeming with mystery. Every shadow hides a new spooky surprise waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>- <strong>FACE MYSTERIOUS CHALLENGES</strong> – Test your wits with mind-bending puzzles, interactive contraptions, and clever riddles that stand between you and the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>- <strong>STAY AHEAD OF DANGER</strong> – Use stealth and cunning to evade a dreadful menagerie of monsters inspired by classic Goosebumps frights, reimagined for an all-new monster-filled experience. Or fight back with your trusty slingshot!</p>
<p>- <strong>EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE ENDINGS</strong> – Your choices shape the fate of Sloane and her friends. Can you unearth the full truth behind Little Creek’s horrors, or will the town’s mysteries consume you?</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles story script will be significantly bigger than the script of the original PlayStation version in terms of characters, the game's director confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://publish.twitter.com/?url=https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1935191460619718669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, director Yasumi Matsuno revealed that, in terms of characters, the Japanese script of the remaster is estimated to be around 60% bigger than the original script. Matsuno-san added that this figure does not include system-related text, chanting text, brave stories, sound novels, or cutscenes. In terms of actual text, Matsuno-san said that it is difficult to compare the total between the new and old versions, but if the increased characters are of any indication, the script has been significantly expanded over the original.</p>
<p>In terms of new content over the original PlayStation version, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles won't feature much besides additional character conversations meant to enhance the story and characters. In a new interview shared by Square Enix on its <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">official website</a>, director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed that the additional content added to the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile ports are based, won't be included, as the team wanted to recreate the original faithfully. Maehiro-san also revealed that one of the biggest challenges in developing the remaster was doing so without the original game's source code, which had been lost, which is not uncommon for older games. As such, the team analyzed various existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming, and even worked things out by feel alone by playing the game.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">September 30th.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has given us a small sneak preview into the next generation of its hardware, and it sounds as though the multi-device, multi-storefront approach will continue across the next few years, at least.</p>

<p>In a new video, Xbox president Sarah Bond discusses what's next for Xbox and its hardware, and while it sounds like there will be new consoles from the company, they're going to look pretty different from what we're used to.</p>

<p>Bond says that Xbox has formed a "multi-year partnership" with AMD to create chips for its new devices, including "next-generation Xbox consoles". Said machines will also include backwards compatibility with previous-gen Xbox games, by the sound of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-next-gen-hardware-amd.jpg?itok=pm9HxZPJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-next-gen-hardware-amd.jpg?itok=pB-fTji8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is teaming up with AMD for the next generation of its consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Bond, this is all in service of building a platform that allows you to play games that aren't constrained to a single device or a single store ecosystem.</p>

<p>While we don't know exactly what that means, it sounds as though next-gen Xbox devices will allow you to access stores outside of the Microsoft Store. That could mean PC stores like Steam, GOG, or the Epic Store become accessible on Xbox devices, which would give console gamers a much broader spectrum of games to play.</p>

<p>In closing, Bond says the Xbox team is working closely with the Windows folks to ensure that "Windows is the number one platform for gaming". It's arguably telling that she says "Windows" rather than "Xbox"; that could imply that next-gen Xbox hardware will run on the Windows platform rather than a bespoke ecosystem for consoles.</p>




<p>In recent years, Xbox has been moving away from its own exclusive ecosystem in favor of releasing its games on other platforms; titles like&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><i>Gears of War Reloaded</i></a>, all of which either were or would have been Xbox exclusives, have been released on other platforms.</p>

<p>It's fair to say Xbox has roundly lost the latest "console wars", if such things are still ongoing (which Xbox would like you to believe they aren't); if last year's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/xbox-series-xs-sales-are-reportedly-less-than-half-of-the-ps5s-with-microsoft-on-track-for-a-repeat-of-ps4-vs-xbox-one/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sales figures</a> are to be believed, then the Xbox Series X|S range is selling much worse than the PS5, which is probably why Bond and her company want to get out of the exclusive business.</p>

<p>Of course, we're still probably a good few years away from next-generation Xbox hardware, so we're probably going to have to wait a while to discover what the company's vision for its new direction is. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>TallBoys and Critical Reflex have announced an open public playtest for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/militsioner">Militsioner</a>, the immersive sim in which you try to escape a town that swelters in the shadow of an extremely large, temperamental policeman. It would be nice to think the premise has gotten less relevant since we first covered the game in 2021, but I suspect that if you are currently living in, say, Los Angeles, you will find much to relate to. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The playtest has yet to kick off, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041689326?l=english">sign up already on Steam</a>. It'll run for two weeks, and will contain "a fraction of the game with most of the mechanics", which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>- Lonely and needy giant with his wishes, attachments and emotions. Learn how to keep his mood in check or to hide when things go south.</p>
<p>- The town's district, packed with a variety of NPCs, items and secrets. All is systematic, interactable and changing based on the time of day</p>
<p>- Flood creeping in from below - when the giant feels bad, the whole town is submerged in water.</p>
<p>- Gifts to build relationships - most items can be gifted, resulting in unique reactions and outcomes.</p>
<p>- Stealth to hide from the giant's wrath - avoid the light and choose the right time to go for illegal options.</p>
<p>- Evading the giant's hand - hide under awnings and pipelines and wait for the right moment to run for it. The hand might not get everywhere, but it's faster than it looks.</p>
<p>- Complete player freedom. Almost every problem has multiple solutions. There are no wrong ways to play the game.</p></blockquote>
<p>The devs caution that this is a test build and as such, subject to change. In particular, you may notice some missing textures. If you're wondering how Militsioner has come along since we covered it last, they also posted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041690500?l=english">progress report</a> earlier this month. Amongst other recent changes, the giant now has an inventory (meaning you can pick his titanic pockets) and the ability to take a day off, which improves his mood and may cause new routes to appear. Townsfolk will now report you for breaking and entering, but you can also persuade them to be your alibi if you're under suspicion.</p>
<p>I've been coming and going with imsims, lately. I think the genre needs some kind of shot in the arm. Perhaps by "shot in the arm" I really mean "King Kopper".
