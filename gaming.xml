                <p>TinyBuild is returning to the town of Raven Brooks with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hello-neighbor-3/" data-ref-id="5000-650465">Hello Neighbor 3</a>, and now players can too with an open playtest. The "cozy yet eerie" game tasks players with exploring--and eventually escaping--the now-half-abandoned town of Raven Brooks.</p><p>The game's second playable prototype was announced in a video by lead developer and franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov, who also gives a general rundown on what players will be able to discover in the playtest. The newest version of Hello Neighbor 3 features an all-new map that's "much closer to what it's meant to be," Kolesnikov.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHK4WtJvlvk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHK4WtJvlvk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The player is tasked with exploring the houses that make up the town of Raven Brooks to find useful items, with the prototype's ultimate goal being to escape before a storm hits the town. Some of the houses are occupied, however--and the occupants may be less than happy with the player's intrusion.</p><p>In Hello Neighbor 3's "system-based world," players can approach every situation in a different way, using stealth, agility, brute force, or even diplomacy. The game's major selling point is that the town of Raven Brooks is a living, reactive sandbox--its inhabitants go about their lives if undisturbed, but can also react in new and different ways to player actions, opening up new pathways in the game.</p><p>Players can request access to the new prototype's playtest on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789680/Hello_Neighbor_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hello Neighbor 3's Steam page</a>.</p><p>While the first Hello Neighbor game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hello-neighbor-review/1900-6416829/" data-ref-id="1900-6416829">reviewed poorly by critics</a> on release, publisher TinyBuild has still managed to spin a whole franchise out of the game, including multiple spin-off games, books, and an animated show.</p>

            <p>The co-CEO of MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy has suggested the game's negative reaction so far has been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio ahead of its release.</p>
<p>MindsEye is an upcoming action-adventure thriller from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, which is being published by Hitman studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>. It is set for release on 10th June, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>A new trailer was released last night, highlighting some of the features coming to the game such as the ability for players to create their own missions using the in-game creation system. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>However, despite the trailers and having veteran developers working at the studio, the reaction to MindsEye has so far been underwhelming. A <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1925528143843999907">bulleted rundown listing issues with the game</a>, which was shared online earlier this week, called MindsEye a "broken mess, filled with bugs" and enemy encounters that "lacked depth".</p>
<p>Now, Build a Rocket Boy's co-CEO has claimed that there is a reason MindsEye is getting negative feedback - it's because people are being paid to do so. In an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server, Mark Gerhard was asked if he believes "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone", to which he replied: "100 percent."</p>
<p>When another user in the chat highlighted Gerhard's claims were rather unexpected, the studio exec replied: "Not wild when it's true....."</p>
<p>In another reply, the studio exec added it "doesn't take much to guess who" with an accompanying laughing emoji, though he didn't elaborate on this point further at the time. However, when confronted about the matter further, Gerhard said there has been a "concerted effort" involved regarding criticism around the game and the studio.</p>
<p>Wrote Gerhard: "I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. It's pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Build a Rocket Boy for comment on Gerhard's claims, however neither the studio or publisher IOI was able to say more at this time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/early-nintendo-switch-2-used-day-1-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Those lucky enough to get a Nintendo Switch 2 before its official launch will only have a rather expensive paperweight on their hands until the system's day one update goes live, according to new online reports.</p>
<p>As reported by Wario64 on X following a short YouTube video featuring a quick unboxing of the system, which has since been removed but has been saved for posterity by <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1927448039330894258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Crave</a>, a user who got an early unit of the console confirmed that the console cannot play any game, neither Switch 1 nor Switch 2 games, without downloading the day 1 update which cannot be done as of now, as the update function will not be available before June 5th, the day the system officially launches worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another person shared with me that they have a Nintendo Switch 2 as well. I have no permission to post pics but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts "Please connect to the internet and update your system."</p>
<p>Needs update to boot a game <a href="https://t.co/18TU7Skk1D">pic.twitter.com/18TU7Skk1D</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Though disappointing, the Nintendo Switch 2 not being able to play any game before its official release date next week will have no impact on the popularity of a system that is rightly expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massive success</a>. Launching with the system on June 5th are plenty of games that will definitely contribute to the system's popularity, such as Mario Kart World, which will likely feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-reverse-track-mode/">reverse track mode</a> as suggested by some recent footage, and a slew of third-party developers ports such as Cyberpunk 2077, which is already showing well <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">before release</a> what the system is capable of, Hogwarts Legacy and a few others. The immediate future is also looking bright, with games like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4: Echoes and others launching in 2026 and beyond, which may be able to deliver better visuals and performance by using more of the system resources than the launch window games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/">according to rumors</a>.</p>

The concern, he suggests, is that as they inevitably expand on a bedrock of first-party titles it will become harder for third-party studios and indies to cross that divide.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions that's really dangerous, because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's really, really risky because there always must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yoshida believes Sony delivered a &quot;healthier&quot; subscription model">Yoshida believes Sony delivered a "healthier" subscription model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing Xbox Game Pass and how Microsoft has evolved the platform by adding more first-party titles while also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-really-wants-you-to-know-day-one-releases-no-longer-standard-on-xbox-game-pass">regaining on its initial pledge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to bring every single Xbox Game Studio project to the service on day one, Yoshida said the company might have bitten off more than it could chew.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/apple-has-its-first-ever-internal-studio-after-acquiring-sneaky-sasquatch-dev-rac7" target="_self" data-discover="true">Apple has its first-ever internal studio after acquiring Sneaky Sasquatch dev RAC7</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While acknowledging his own bias as a former PlayStation exec, Yoshida suggested Sony's take on the subscription model through PlayStation Plus—which has seen the company make major first-party titles available to subscribers, but only after a traditional premium release—was perhaps "healthier."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I believe the way Sony approached [subscriptions] is healthier. You know, not to overpromise and to allow people to spend money to buy the new games," he added. "After a couple of years there won't be many people willing to buy those games at that initial price, so they'll be added to the subscription service and there'll be more people to try [those products] in time for the next game in the franchise to come out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although he feels Microsoft might have made an initial misstep with that 'day one' pledge, Yoshida said the company has excelled in other areas. He described Microsoft's approach to backwards compatibility—which saw the company make it possible for Xbox Series X | S owners to play thousands of original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One titles—as "smart and very well planned."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They must have put a lot of engineering effort in to achieve what they have done," he continued.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developer-revives-flash-game-after-creator-finds-source-code-on-kid-s-laptop" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cult Flash game revived after programmer rescues source code from kid's laptop</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft wasn't the only company to receive plaudits during our chat.

			<p>A new version of the Dark Souls Re-Remastered visual overhaul mod is now available for download, introducing significant improvements in select locations.</p>
<p>The 1.27 version of the mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/642?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces new, higher resolution specular maps for most of Firelink Shrine, Undead Burg, and The Depths, significantly improving the visuals in these locations. To celebrate the release of the new version of the mod and the 100K downloads, the developer fromsoftserve shared a new video showcasing the improvements outlined above. You can check out the video below.</p>

<p>Dark Souls Re-Remastered is being developed by the same developer who created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remastered Project</a>, a visual overhaul mod made possible by the impressive emulation improvements delivered by the ShadPS4 emulator, making the PlayStation 4 exclusive playable on PC. The mod adds dynamic shadows to every map, upscales almost every texture, generates new normal maps for most surfaces, better water reflections and distant geometry, adjusted depth of field, better ambient occlusion on the player lantern, and more.</p>
<p>Dark Souls Re-Remastered is compatible with the Remastered version of the first entry in the series created by FromSoftware released a while back on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ho, Lethal Companions! Put down your airhorns, let fall your precious armfuls of plastic fish, and prick up your freakin' ears. Something is coming to 2023's breakout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> multiplayer game. Something that will make the music boxes and springhead marionettes look like child's playthings! I mean, like the child's playthings they already look like, but without the parts that make them horrifying. That something is... to be announced, but I considered the below teaser text pithy enough to be worth a shout regardless.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The new creature is technically maybe the most powerful creature in the game, and the power easily goes to its head," explains appallingly young developer Zeekerss on <a href="https://x.com/ZeekerssRBLX/status/1926872112347722041">social media</a>. "Sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense, just because it can."
</p>
<p>
There is an infinity of enigma couched within the words "sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense". There are countless things in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> that defy sense-making, not least the game's players, who repeatedly land on emaciated moons populated by giant spiders and ghost girls to harvest rubber duckies and V-type engines, which they then feed to a mouth in a wall. I look forward to experiencing how Zeekerss plans to raise the stakes. 
</p>
<p>
In general, I like the idea of an entity deliberately deciding to do things that seem nonsensical. When we encounter this in other games, we tend to call it an error, depending on our flexible understanding of where the border between sense and nonsense lies. I've always enjoyed reading forum thread attempts to reach across the line and redefine "purely" errant behaviour as plausible. For example, weaving a little mythology around the fact that horses in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> are able to witness crimes. It's because every horse in Tamriel is descended from Horseplay, God of Tattletaling.
</p>
<p>
Lethal Company's thunder has been stolen by, amongst others, the recent R.E.P.O., with its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/repo-is-steams-latest-viral-horror-despite-its-high-mate-requirement">"Jim Henson does Nier Automata"</a> characters. Still, it remains a grand and very sociable anti-capitalist chiller. I'm deeply thankful to Zeekerss for engineering a genre of extraction game in which the extraction process is fundamentally cursed. On which note, this news article is now over - please gather up your airhorns and plastic fish and get back to the ship, pronto. Does anybody hear giggling?

My sherry-swilling, moustache-twirling armchair theorist understanding of <a href="https://www.secore.org/en/our-work/all-about-corals/coral-reef-crisis">ocean-wide coral decline</a> is that addressing it will require a, forgive me, seachange in attitudes towards the "natural" realm we generally position as external and other, ripe for the despoiling - a new way of inhabiting and co-constituting this mote caught in a sunbeam, this stargazing planet from which lamentation is spun, this blithe blue impossibility we (but who are "we"???) call home. Failing that, perhaps we can ask some magic Pixar squid to play underwater <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is my fairly jaded introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-below">Life Below</a>, the latest game from Trolls vs Vikings devs Megapop and Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus publishers Kasedo, which I do genuinely find intriguing in that it is trying to do two, somewhat incompatible things.

On the one polyp, it wants to educate players about organisms that, as the PR pitch explains, make up 0.01% of the ocean floor, and yet support 25% of ocean life, with input from marine biologists. On the other polyp, it would hate you to get the impression that it's just here to teach you things. Heavens, no! Life Below is a real-ass strategy management game, whose relatively bizarre pedagogic aspects are kept firmly in check, but hopefully not suffocated by its adherence to genre.</p>
<p>"While the environment and sustainability are important themes, this isn't 'edu-tainment' - this is a <em>proper</em> strategy game," comments the press release, emphasis theirs. They also want it to be one of "the most accessible city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> ever": Life Below is being created in collaboration with disability consultant Arevya and gaming charity Special Effect UK. 
</p>
<p>
In Life Below, you are a representative of Gaia, personification of Earth's life force. Gaia is often invoked in games with upbeat ecological vibes. I would quite like wholesome gamedevs to spend more time reading about Gaia as originally depicted in Greek myth. In keeping with much of Greek myth, it's an absolute quagmire. Did you know that Gaia spawned Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, using the hacked-off testicles of her husband, Uranus, after she conspired with her son Cronus to have him carved to pieces, in vengeance for Uranus turning Gaia's very body into a kind of cyclops petting zoo? Let's have some of <em>that</em> in games with eco themes, and fewer puppy-eyed jellyfish bois.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how it works is that you send out your twinkling octopus children to cultivate a grid of barren seafloor, planting the equivalent of buildings on resource nodes, and using fixtures such as "seagrass lure" to summon a range of aquatic species to your coral city. You must then keep those lifeforms happy and protect them from threats. The latter include biome change, infestations of creatures who threaten to wreck the reef's equilibrium, and fluctuating algae levels. 
</p>
<p>
The worst nasties, such as oil spills and floating garbage patches, may require the attention of "special wildlife". Without consulting any Wiki pages, I'm envisaging some kind of plastic-eating bacteria who live inside the mouth of a roving basking shark. Not all the external elements are undesirable: sometimes, a nice whale might swim overhead. I'm not sure what the effect will be on your reef. It'll be interesting to discover whether Life Below can translate any of its oceanic learnings into novel mechanics, or whether this is just a Little Mermaid skinpack for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game is out in 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932150/Life_Below/">The Steam page is here</a>. Look out for a demo during Next Fest in June.

			<p>A new Oblivion Remastered mod now available for download makes the Imperial City more atmospheric and beautiful at night with the introduction of new light sources.</p>
<p>The Rabbit's Real Lights Imperial City, now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2852?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces over 500 new hand-placed light sources and objects that provide better visibility at night and make the Imperial City more beautiful than ever. So far, new lights have been added to the Arena District, Elven Garden, Imperial Palace, Market District, Talos Plaza, Temple District, Arboretum, and Arcane District, leaving only the Prison District in its vanilla state. This mod is also fully compatible with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumiere - Lights of Cyrodiil mod</a>, which adds light sources outdoors all over Cyrodiil, making the two mods complementary and a must-download for those looking to improve how the game looks at night.</p>

<p>Oblivion Remastered launched late last month after having been rumored to be in the works for a while. Powered by both Unreal Engine 5 and the original engine, the remaster is extremely faithful in terms of gameplay, making the experience instantly familiar to those who have already ventured into Cyrodiil, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>It's not only a fitting sales milestone for the game, but a huge debut success for the studio. Even French <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">President Macron has congratulated the team</a>.</p>

<p>For those yet to play the game, the number 33 is key to the story. Players control the 33rd expedition on a mission to stop the mysterious Paintress from killing the population. The game then plays on this number in multiple ways - the maximum level for your weapons is 33, for one example.</p>

			<p>Swedish developer MachineGames might have canceled an unannounced project a while ago. Timur222 <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1927629681982915009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> the tidbit of information earlier today while scouring the LinkedIn resume of a former Lead Artist who worked on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and this mysterious project between February 2022 and January 2024.</p>
<p>Needless to say, given the developer's history, Wolfenstein fans are worried that the canceled game is none other than Wolfenstein III. Following the launch of New Colossus in 2017, MachineGames worked on two spin-offs, the co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wolfenstein-youngblood-kids-alright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youngblood</a> and the VR game Cyberpilot, neither of which was well received. Back then, Bethesda's VP of Marketing Pete Hines had <a href="https://wccftech.com/pete-hines-confirms-wolfenstein-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a proper third installment to conclude the series would be made, but the years went on without such an announcement.</p>
<p>We now know that the studio dedicated itself to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but it's possible that they had a team working on Wolfenstein III and the project didn't pan out. Whether they will try again now that the Indy project is done remains to be seen. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was highly successful for MachineGames, earning unanimous praise from gamers and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press</a> alike. The game had registered four million players by January 2025, although it's always complex to gauge how many of those were full time sales with Game Pass in the mix. The subsequent launch on PlayStation 5 certainly helped.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-might-get-a-sequel-hints-phil-spencer-though-he-certainly-sounds-more-interested-in-owned-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened up</a> to a sequel in an interview last month. At the same time, he made it quite clear that he'd prefer Microsoft-owned teams to work on owned franchises, which Indiana Jones most definitely is not. Wolfenstein would fall in that category, but will MachineGames, Bethesda, and Microsoft give the franchise another try? I certainly hope so, as B.J. Blazkowicz's story needs a proper ending.</p>

            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will have a reverse mode for the first time.</p>
<p>Previous games in the series have included Mirror Mode as an unlockable extra, which flips tracks horizontally for a new challenge.</p>
<p>However, characters have been spotted racing in reverse in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5wuhtJfj54&amp;t=51s">Japan-only advert</a> for the new game, suggesting a reverse mode will finally be included.</p>

<p>The advert includes footage of characters racing around the Mario Bros. Circuit in the opposite direction, when compared to footage from Nintendo's Treehouse Live stream (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/it-seems-that-you-can-play-courses-in-reverse-in-mario-kart-world/">NintendoSoup</a>).</p>
<p>It's unknown yet how racing in reverse will be included in the game - perhaps as a separate option following completion of 150cc - but the footage appears to show a Grand Prix race rather than Knockout Tour, judging by the UI.</p>
<p>Of course, with Mario Kart World being an open world game, players will be able to drive in all directions in Free Roam, so it would make sense Nintendo would make use of this for its Grand Prix.</p>
<p>It's not long to wait now until we'll be able to play Mario Kart World for ourselves. It launches alongside the Switch 2 on 5th June - that's next week!</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-was-first-developed-for-the-original-switch-but-60fps-only-possible-on-switch-2">Nintendo shared an interview with Mario Kart World's developers</a>. They confirmed the game was originally in development for the original Switch, but the open world design was better suited to the new console running at 60fps.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-of-the-best-skating-games-are-back-on-steam-after-being-mysteriously-pulled-from-sale-months-ago<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Two very good skating games are back up for sale on Steam after disappearing for four months. Bright 'n' cheery skateboarding game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> and dystopian rollerskate shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a> both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-have-been-de-listed-from-steam-and-nobody-knows-why">vanished in a cloud of toxic corporate smoke</a> in February this year, some time after the closure of the games' developers Roll7. But it looks like the poisonous fumes have finally cleared, and the games are once again available.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not clear why the games have been absent. But it is very likely the result of legal and business hullabaloo caused by parent company Take-Two Interactive last year. Come with me now on a dollar-burning trip through the wastes of global financial malignancy, as I tell a tale as old and stupid as time.</p>
<p>The original developers of the games, Roll7, were owned by publishers Private Division, who were in turn owned by merciless corpocolossus Take-Two Interactive. In May last year Private Division were sold off by their business daddy to a private equity firm, and the studio who actually made good games, Roll7, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">unceremoniously shut down</a> as a result. The CEO of Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">tried to deny this</a>, but the effect on workers at both Roll7 and other Private Division studios (like the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> developers) was clear. They were all laid off. </p>
<p>It's a disappointing, if familiar, tale. But the delisting of the games months after the sale and their reappearance this week is a weird afterword. On the Steam page for both games, 2K (Take-Two's publishing moniker) are now listed as publisher. At the time of the sale, Take-Two said they were including all of Private Divisions "live and unreleased" games. But they now claim otherwise. 2K has "confirmed that neither Rollerdrome nor OlliOlli World were included in the Private Division sale, and that it is now the publisher of both games," according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-are-back-on-steam-after-being-delisted-4-months-ago-when-2k-sold-off-private-division/">PC Gamer</a>. Weird. </p>
<p>Whatever the dumbass legal reason that caused the games to disappear, it appears to be solved. Now you enter the realm of minor ethical dilemma: buy the games because they are excellent, or ignore them completely because the company who stands to profit fired everyone who worked on said bangers? Of course, other skulduggery is possible, as noted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kimhu.bsky.social/post/3kztixxrogd26">at least two people</a> who worked on the game. Do whatever you like, I can't tell you what's right. What do I know? I'm just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood">the 21st best player of OlliOlli 2</a> (on PlayStation 4). </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In the run up to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release next week (next week!), Nintendo has released a new video highlighting the changes N64 classics will have on the console's debut.</p>
<p>Those with a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription are able to play classic games from the N64 days, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, Pokémon Snap, and a personal favourite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>And soon, those on Switch 2 will be able to play these games, and then rewind them when things don't go quite as planned (what, that has never happened to me), pop on a CRT screen filter and remap the controls. You can check out how this all looks via the video below.</p>

<p>While those on the original Switch consoles won't be able to utilise that rewind feature or the  CRT screen filter, they will be able to remap the controls when this update goes live.</p>
<p>As to when all this is happening, that would be next Thursday, 5th June. That's the day Switch 2 releases.</p>

<p>In the meantime while we wait patiently for next week, you can check out the full run down of games available on Nintendo's subscription service via our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">All Nintendo Switch Online games available to play right now</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2, while it is not technically available just yet, some have managed to get their hands on the console early. Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">footage was shared online of someone unpacking their new console</a>, however they were unable to play it due to it requiring a day one update to function. Nintendo obviously didn't seem best pleased with this video making the rounds online, and soon removed the footage from the internet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A pretty sharp viewership decline was registered in The Last of Us Season 2 finale on HBO. The widely acclaimed debut season had over 8.2 million viewers in the United States despite airing at the same time as the Oscars ceremony. However, the season that just ended only registered 3.7 million viewers (<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Wrap</a>), a 55% drop. HBO cautioned that the numbers might increase and reminded everyone that the series has been watched globally by over 90 million viewers, with the second season averaging almost 37 million global viewers per episode.</p>
<p>It's all too easy to imagine the drop could have been caused by a certain character's death that gamers know all too well from The Last of Us Part II. However, HBO has already renewed the show for a third season, which will place a larger focus on Abby. In a press conference dedicated to The Last of Us Season 2 finale, series co-creator Craig Mazin <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-7-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>There is another side to this story that we have yet to really delve into. And there’s no question that Abby is the hero of her story. Where we go next, all I can say is it will always be centering on somebody, whether it’s Ellie and Dina or whether it’s Abby. But really, if you want to boil it down, everything is under the cloud or sunlight of Joel — what Joel did to Abby and what Joel did for Ellie — and that will never change.</em></p>
<p>In other franchise news, The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-avowed-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Last week, series creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the much-requested third installment could be made, but only if he and Naughty Dog as a whole can find a worthy story to tackle.</p>

            <p>Reader, I'm getting some serious de ja vu from the the poster for <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">Liberation Escape Rooms</a> 'Castle Of Conundrums' experience, but I'm having trouble placing it. I don't <em>think</em> I've been to this escape room before, never having visited the town of Southaven, Mississippi. Perhaps I should go? The <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">reviews are</a> positively glowing. "Very exciting and unique escape rooms," writes Anna R. Five stars! "Today's game in the Castle just blew us away," enthuses Tracey S. Five stars again! An unmissable experience by all accounts. And yet, I'd feel woefully unequiped to take on the Castle Of Conundrums if I cannot solve the much more pressing conundrum at hand.</p>

<p>"The king and his knights are on a quest to protect the crown. While they are away, a new and formidable threat appears just beyond the castle walls," reads the lore blurb. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Worst possible time this could have happened. "Can you prove your worthiness in Merlin’s trials, become a knight, and defend the kingdom?". Wait. What? Why is Merlin holding trials when the castle is in danger from a threat - need I remind you - that is <em>just beyond the castle walls</em>?! There's no time for your classic chicanery, Merlsy! We need knights <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>A familiar set-up, no doubt. But no, no. That's not it. There's something <em>else</em> familiar about the poster for Liberation Escape Rooms Presents The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5. Why, it's that plaque in the top left, isn't it? The breastplate. The crossed swords. Why, that's definitely Dark Knight Armoury's <a href="https://www.darkknightarmoury.com/product/heraldic-eagle-breastplate-with-two-decorative-swords-wall-plaque/">Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque</a>! The only problem is that I've never laid eyes on Dark Knight Armoury's Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque, so it must be something else.</p>
<p>"We have done a handful of escape rooms in the Memphis area and this was by far one of the best!!!!!" writes Alicia B. Five stars again! Can you not see the subterfuge occurring right before your eyes, Alicia? You and your other five star compatriots? Are you so swayed by Liberation Escape Rooms' - by all accounts - unbeatable customer service that you've willingly blinded yourself to the lies contained in the poster for The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5? Is it left solely to me to unpack its uncanny familiarity; the sole possessor of open eyes in a land where gummy-lidded herds chew mindlessly on opiatic cud like newborn foals?</p>
<p>Hang on. Hang on. It's the bloody font, isn't it? Classic <a href="https://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/bluebeard/">bluebeard</a>. I'd recognise you anywhere. Phew.</p>

You can remap all of the buttons, adjust stick and trigger sensitivities, create deadzones, alter the intensity of the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, and save all of these settings to custom profiles. You can then assign those profiles to the function buttons, which allows you to quickly switch between setups while playing.</p><p>The DualSense Edge syncs wirelessly to your PS5, PC, Mac, or mobile device via Bluetooth. For competitive players who prefer wired connections, the DualSense Edge comes with a removable lock. for the braided USB-C cable that prevents you from accidentally disconnecting the cord from the controller's port. Just like with the standard DualSense, adaptive trigger feedback and haptics are typically reserved for wired mode on PC.</p><p>The controller and all of the components are neatly stored in the included hardshell carrying case.

            <p>“The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne," wrote Chaucer. But you'd trained hard with that crossbow, and let any man in bolting distance try to claim you hadn't mastered it. You never wanted to go to war, but the crops were failing, you'd just lost your seventeenth child to medium-pox, and dark portents swirled on the horizon like curdled goat's milk. Also, the actual goat's milk was curdling.</p>
<p>In that tent, you'd communed with angels, and the righteous fury of all the heavens coursed through every fibre of your being. You'd likely die today, you knew. But you'd die knowing you did all you could to put this fair kingdom to rights. You step outside, breathe deep the morning air, and immediately eat a point blank pump-action shotgun to the torso. Then you lose both your legs to the tank shell. Then someone runs over your corpse with a dirtbike. Bloody typical.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> made memeish waves when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">first teased last February</a>, and while it'd be easy to write it off as just a one-note joke based on an inherently goofy power imbalance (you have guns and tanks, they have swords and horses), there does look to be a bit more occurring here. It's a four-player co-op action game where you'll be also able to command armies a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a>, and build fortifications on the fly a la, uh, Fortnite I guess. I estimate the simple joys of shotgun vs pikeman will last for about forty minutes, but assuming the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> layer holds up, I'm still very much into this.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on the single-save honour mode, and Kingmakers looks to have its own honour mode of sorts, too, should you fancy it. As mentioned in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2109770/discussions/0/4340977379955918858/">dev Q&amp;A</a>, you'll be able to use a sword and shield, so it sounds like you can theoretically ignore the helicopters and grenade launchers and just get stuck in the melee. I'm not sure why you would, mind. Honour is for chumps that didn't bring enough helicopters. Kingmakers releases in early access October 8th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>F1 games are ones I've played quite a lot in the past. Most of them, in reality. Having seen Codemasters grow the series and their acquisition by EA, it would always be interesting to see how they progress the series in the future. It was also going to be interesting because, and let's be completely honest, F1 as a motorsport does not change much, so what have Codemasters and EA done in <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> to make it stand apart from the rest?</p>
<p>Brad Pitt, that's what they've done. I didn't even know there was a film based on F1 coming out, but now I do, thanks to the game and the fact that I have spent my time on F1 25 playing as Mr Pitt himself.</p>

<p>So what is the link? Aside from them both being based on motorsport, Sonny Hayes is one of the drivers with the team from the film that you can take behind the wheel, even running a whole career mode as them rather than creating a different fictional team from scratch. This is what I did most of my time with the game: I played the My Team career mode, controlling APxGP and pushing them from the bottom to the top, all while keeping <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/7/7b/Tylerbetterpicture.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170410170911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Durden</a> front and centre.</p>
<p>As you interact more with the drivers and backroom, the My Team mode feels more responsive and interactive than before. You will keep track of your rating by fans and their current sentiment, driven by your performance on the course. Your finances will be driven by the number of staff in each of your departments and their wages, your sponsorships, and, naturally, linked to your performance on the track. Do better, everything gets better. This is particularly true when you happen to enter a rivalry and beat them.</p>
<p>Between these, you will research and develop new parts that can be attached to your drivers and their cars. You will invest in your HQ, improve different facilities to increase staffing, and train your owner to get even more bonuses. It all creates a good sense of progression as you move from a brand-new team with few resources to a masterclass team with the best car on the track.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this is easier if you're good on the track. If there's one thing to say about F1 25, it's that it's the most realistic venture Codemasters has put out. Several tracks have been scanned using LIDAR (Laser imaging detection and ranging), which means every single centimetre is accurate in width and height. Not all tracks have been created using LIDAR, and some have had new features. Silverstone, for example, allows you to race in reverse.</p>
<p>In addition to improving the circuits, the elements surrounding the track add to the atmosphere. Codemasters gave an example in the build-up to release: the cherry blossoms around Suzuka, in the same place as real life. This adds to the exceptional visual quality and the feeling of being part of the race.</p>
<p>Now, I have to admit that at this point, I'm pretty terrible at the F1 games when I have zero assistance. I don't have everything on, and I don't like feeling railroaded. Still, I do tend to need the help to stop me spinning out and essentially creating a Final Destination moment as my car goes careening off into the spectators, killing dozens. Maybe the next tie-in Codemasters and EA could consider, though?</p>
<p>I find the handling and general racing to feel excellent, particularly when you find that balance where it's manageable for you, without making it too easy by crippling the AI. Added to this are other options that can make the game as sim or arcade as you like, even getting to the point where you can turn off penalties for turning it into Destruction Derby. This will always be a positive in any game, allowing you to play however you want.</p>

<p>Now, there are some negatives with F1 25. I'm used to unskippable cutscenes and other annoying elements in your bigger story-focused titles, and they can be annoying. For an F1 game, it wasn't something on my bingo list. The build-up to a race feels a little too realistic, in that you're listening to commentators talk about how your special brand of rubber is the exact one used in a mastodon's condom, which is why it's perfect for corner 9, compared to that of the other teams. Those specific words may not be used, but it feels like they're trying too hard to set the scene, rather than letting me get behind the wheel.</p>
<p>I can't say I'm exactly fond of the microtransactions either, specifically because you can buy XP boosts. If they were <em>just</em> for cosmetic items, of which there are loads, I could live with it. XP boosts, though, I'll never support pay-to-win or pay-to-progress in a full-priced title. Ever.</p>
<p>Back to the positives. The four game modes give you something to enjoy, and while it isn't all out yet, due to the film not being out, I am strangely looking forward to following the story of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg/250px-Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg">Louis de Pointe du Lac</a>. This is even though I find the Breaking Point mode too railroaded. It seems the inclusion of <a href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5cdacd630c67926f7fea3f72/1:1/w_1669,h_1669,c_limit/MCDTROY_EC007.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Achilles</a> is what makes the story interesting.</p>

<p>The more I play F1 games, the harder it is to talk about them. This is particularly true when the advancements are less noticeable. Codemasters have taken some steps forward with this one, certainly in terms of the accuracy of the tracks and in improving the handling. Still, their most significant step forward for me is expanding My Team. I want to see more, but I'm glad to take what I can for now. All in all, I would recommend F1 25. It's a very good racing game, and it's still the F1 game that will give you the closest F1 experience, warts and all.</p>
