<p>Remember last September when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a> teamed up with Capcom to promote the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_investigations_collection">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a>?</p>
<p>Well, it's not done with this Ace Attorney collaboration just yet. Following the release of a Miles Edgeworth outfit, developer Innersloth has now taken to social media to announce it's "calling in a defense expert", with the reveal of a free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">Phoenix Wright</a> outfit.</p>
<p>If you log into Among Us <em>before</em> <strong>17th March 2025</strong>, you can receive Phoenix Wright's suit as well as his iconic hair.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, in the Miles Edgeworth crossover, Innersloth released this character's signature grey bangs, red suit, and jabot. You can find out more about this particular update in our previous post here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>This update to Among Us also follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/were-not-getting-a-new-game-but-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-gets-a-free-update">big free update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</a> on the Switch last November.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652">The Poké Court</a>, a local <em>Pokémon </em>card and collector’s shop in Manhattan, was <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">r</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">obbed at gunpoint back in January</a>. Armed burglars showed up and terrorized guests during the middle of a crowded event. As traumatic as it was, the employees told <em>Kotaku </em>that the broader<em> Pokémon </em>community showed up to support them. Bust as word spread, Nintendo was apparently made aware of the store has since reached out to the owners to…ask them to change their branding.</p> <p>The shop posted on its <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepokecourt/p/DU4J-WtkSNT/">Instagram account</a> that Nintendo reached out with “concerns” about its name and logo, which included the iconic red-and-white Poké Ball.&nbsp;“The short story is Nintendo reached out to us with concerns about our name and logo,” the message read. “This means we’re evolving!”</p>

 <p>As such, the owners have released a statement with a new name and logo. The store will now be called The Trainer Court, and now has replaced the Poké Ball logo with a new one with a stylized “C” for “Court.” Beyond that, the store will continue to offer the same cards, community events, and tournaments. The Trainer Court will also be hosting an event on Pokémon Day, February 27, which commemorates the series’ 30th anniversary.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000669829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669829"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669829">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p>“Above all, we have always been fans of <em>Pokémon</em>,” the statement reads. “We are a group of kids who refuse to grow up, and we spend every day celebrating this franchise that means so much to us.”</p>

 <p>Nintendo has a history of being litigious about fan creations, events, and businesses, whether that be pretty normal stuff like <a href="https://kotaku.com/another-pokemon-fan-game-says-nintendo-shut-them-down-1790360365">fan games</a>, or more unsavory business <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-lawsuit-streamer-2000640438">like piracy</a>. They certainly didn’t step in when the Department of Homeland Security was using the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon </em>theme song&nbsp;to promote ICE, though.</p>

 <p>The Pokémon Company did <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">release a statement to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em></a> confirming it wasn’t involved, but the video is <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">still up on social media</a> and has received over 75 million views on X alone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710850/Become/"><em>Become</em></a>, the upcoming 3D platformer from indie developer Valentin Wirth, is a bildungsroman with a twist. Instead of a story about a young person’s moral journey through adolescence, it’s a game about a sperm cell’s physical journey to beat millions of others in a race for the ultimate prize: the opportunity to fertilize an egg and create life itself. It’s a tale of survival, growth, ingenuity, and self-reflection set inside the human reproductive system. It’s a bildongsroman, folks.</p> <p>Since its announcement, <em>Become</em> has garnered attention (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-game-become-where-you-play-as-sperm-racing-to-create-life-goes-viral-3319593/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>) for its playful treatment of its subject matter and fun visuals. The game’s trailer opens with text that reads “Deep inside the balls” in a <em>Finding Nemo</em>-coded font, and features sperm cells swimming through lush, undersea-like environs while sporting stylish accessories such as cowboy hats and shark costumes. <em>Become</em>‘s Steam page describes the game as a “short single player, third person adventure” in which you must “learn, adapt, and grow stronger as you explore the fascinating but dangerous microcosm of the human reproductive system.”</p>

  <p>Based on the early build showcased in the trailer, that translates to a skill progression system with evocatively (and provocatively) named upgrades like “Busty Bouncer” and “Got Milk.” We’ll leave it up to you to imagine what bonuses those skills might impart on your lil’ guy.</p> <p>Wirth is a first-time solo developer with credits in the cinematic and art departments for games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-iii-the-kotaku-review-1787722761"><em>Mafia III</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/crime-boss-rockay-city-impressions-bad-terrible-shit-pc-1850297022"><em>Crime Boss: Rockay City</em></a>. <em>Become</em> is set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026, “If I don’t f*ck it up,” Wirth added in the trailer. Hopefully, both the game and the sperm stay on track for release.</p>

<p>Now might be a good time to revisit Skyrim</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="7d72872352d24"><a title="Skyrim" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d72872352d24/skyrim.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> didn't exactly launch in the best state when it arrived on the Switch 2 at the end of last year, but Bethesda is now rolling out patches for the title to improve the overalle experience.</p>
<p>This week sees the arrival of <strong>Update 1.2</strong> for the Switch 2 version of the game. This includes a 60Hz mode, allowing players to prioritise either visuals or performance. The update also locks the frame rate at 30Hz when prioritising visuals, improves FPS drops in certain locations, and fixes a bunch of bugs - including Joy-Con 2 controller problems.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, according to Bethesda's official patch notes (via social media):</p>
<h2><strong>Skyrim Switch 2 Update 1.2 Notes</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added a 60 Hz mode under Display settings that allows players to toggle between “Prioritize Visuals” or “Prioritize Performance”.</em></li>
<li><em>In addition, frame rate has been locked at 30 Hz in “Prioritize Visuals” mode for smoother gameplay.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crashes and Performance Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that occurred when reading “The Crimson Dirks Vol. 4” book for the “Tilted Scales” quest in German.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an audio-related crash.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash, infinite load, and game freeze that sometimes occurred when rapidly selecting “Load” multiple times in the pause menu.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that occurred when the “Transmute Ore” spell was repeatedly cast outside of the Haltered Stream Camp.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved FPS performance drops that occurred in the following locations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>during the Hide and Seek quest in Kynesgrove</em></li>
<li><em>during combat at Secunda’s Kiss</em></li>
<li><em>when discovering the “Drelas’ Cottage” location</em></li>
<li><em>when engaged in combat with a giant at the Talking Stone Camp.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visuals Issues Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Viewing water planes from a distance or within menus caused them to shift up and down.</em></li>
<li><em>Distant aspen trees appeared with a blue tint.</em></li>
<li><em>Transitioning out of caves caused an outline of the entrance to linger during the fade-to-back loading screen.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Interface Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in dialogue or the Help menu, caused different options to be highlighted.</em></li>
<li><em>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in help menus or user hints, did not dynamically update callout prompts.</em></li>
<li><em>The “Ready/Sheathe” option was missing from the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls menu.</em></li>
<li><em>The “Delete” prompt remained grayed-out within the Load menu when swapping between mouse and controller mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Deleting a save in the Save/Load menus reset the highlighted selection to the top of the menu list.</em></li>
<li><em>While in mouse mode, the cursor remained stuck within a smaller section of the screen when changing between docked/undocked modes or interfacing with GameChat.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controls Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The “Eagle Eye” Archery perk remained active after switching between mouse and controller mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Holding down the Right Joystick while reassigning a button caused that button to disappear from the Controls list.</em></li>
<li><em>The Joy-Con 2 controllers provided haptic feedback while in mouse mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Buttons became unresponsive when controls were remapped while moving the Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Rotating the map in mouse mode was slower and less smooth than in controller mode.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audio Issue Fix</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scrolling SFX continued to play while holding up or down on the Left Joystick or buttons at the top or bottom of the Save/Load menus.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Localization Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Amiibo” appeared as plural in Spanish.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added new translations for the features listed above and UI updates.</em></li>
<li><em>Updates were made to the game credits.</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This update follows the release of a patch towards the end of December 2025, which addressed input latency issues.</p>
<p>When we reviewed Skyrim: Anniversary Edition on Switch 2, we called it "hugely disappointing" - mentioning at the time how the title was still running at 30fps and had "awful input lag to boot", so it's great to see the overall experience is slowly improving.</p>

<p>If you haven't already jumped into Skyrim on Switch 2, it's a free upgrade for owners of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Anniversary Edition</a> on Switch.</p>

      <p>I may have just been reminded to<a href="https://aftermath.site/master-commander-total-war-rts-strategy/"> <u>never judge a book by its cover</u></a>, but sometimes the cover is so bad that I can't help it.</p><p>A few years back EA Sports and FIFA, who had collaborated for decades on the globe-conquering <em>FIFA </em>series of video games, split.

As <a href="https://aftermath.site/medieval-iii-total-war-fifa-netflix-delphi-announce/" rel="noreferrer">I said in December</a>:</p><blockquote>Earlier today Netflix<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix?ref=aftermath.site">&nbsp;<u>announced</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>that Delphi, a company you've likely never heard of (they're relatively new, and their only public credit is as support on IO's upcoming&nbsp;<em>007&nbsp;</em>game) will be both developing and publishing a new FIFA game.</blockquote><p>That was all we knew at the time, but now,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/meet-delphi-interactive-the-publisherdeveloper-behind-the-new-fifa-game?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>courtesy of an interview Delphi recently conducted with GI.biz</u></a>, we know more.

            <title><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Magic: The Gathering Cards Are Winning Me Over With Their Big-Time Video Game Vibes]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tmnt-mtg-commander-leonardo-donatello-shredder-krang-2000669775</link>
            <guid>1438900</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was very skeptical of <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-record-final-fantasy-hasbro-2000668256"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s rapid return</a> to the streets of New York for a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> pizza party. I still am. But the set is full of a surprising amount of love for the franchise’s strong video game roots that has me softening my stance a bit.</p> <p>I’ve seen all of the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> movies, played most of the games, watched a ton of the cartoons, read some of the comics, and played with plenty of action figures. I’m a millennial who was old enough to play <em>Turtles</em> in the arcade, watch them on Saturday mornings, and longingly eye the racks of toys in ’90s department stores. What I’m saying is that, as a frequent <em>MTG</em> enjoyer as well, I’m the perfect mark for a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><em>TMNT</em> Universes Beyond set</a>.</p>

 <p>But I initially greeted news of the expansion with a groan. <em>MTG</em> fatigue has been setting in on a few different levels. We’re not even six months removed from <a href="https://kotaku.com/mtg-spider-man-ff-prices-ebay-preorder-sold-out-1851767413">last year’s New York-centric <em>Spider-Man</em> set</a>, and just a few months away from a <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-horn-greed-heroic-intervention-2000651812">Marvel Super Heroes expansion</a> bringing more Manhattan flavor to the card game. Plus, there’s the rapid pace of new launches. <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> still feels fresh; <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> seems like it just came out yesterday.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000669819" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669819"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669819">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">It’s too much too soon</a>. <em>TMNT</em> releasing on March 6 only adds to the exhaustion. And yet I can already feel myself coming around thanks to the clever ways Wizards is trying to imbue the set with an identity drawn from multiple sources. Some cards are callbacks to the animated series, some use art from the comics, and others play into moments and aesthetics from the most recent <em>TMNT</em> movie, 2023’s<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-video-game-ninja-turtles-movie-date-1850810080">Mutant Mayhem</a></em>. Each era and sensibility gets some special attention.</p>

 <p>Instead of relying on just the characters and conflicts to drive the lore and flavor, the expansion is effectively a multi-decade tribute to a larger pop-culture phenomenon. Different cards will tug at different parts of players’ nostalgia. For me, it’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693/2">video game legacy</a> that has me excited to start ripping packs with friends. The set both calls back to home console and arcade classics and channels that spirit into certain mechanics.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000669821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669821"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669821">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p>First, there’s the borderless pixel art cards which just look really rad. Not only are the characters pixel art but you also get 8-bit-looking color symbols and text box windows. You also have a range of video-game-themed cards like Level Up, which gives you double +1/+1 counters after attacking, and High Score, which lets you draw cards for having the strongest creature on the board. Arcade Cabinet, meanwhile, leans into the +1/+1 counter strategy with a neat four-player nod.</p> <p>Let’s talk about Commander.&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em> introduces a completely novel concept to the popular MTG offshoot: coop. Instead of just one Commander card, you can have two as long as the card has “Partner.” Combine Leonardo and Donatello to create a token +1/+1 counter engine that will make everyone else at the table lose their minds as you try to keep track of your board.</p>

   <p>And then there’s the call-outs to particular <em>TMNT</em> moments unique to the games. Shredder, Shadow Master creates copies of himself like in the arcade game’s final boss fight. The art for Leatherhead, meanwhile, is a riff on the Wild West theme from the alligator’s SNES <em>Turtles In Time</em> appearance. Most iconic of all is a card called Electric Seaweed, a plant wall which will instantly be recognizable and terrifying to everyone who died in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUnn3sXt_Q">bomb-defusing level in the NES game</a>.</p> <p>Wizards is having a lot of fun with this set and getting creative in unexpected ways. There are land cards with pizza art where each slice represents a different color based on the toppings. Dr. Baxter’s Mousers are some of the coolest-looking token creature cards out in a while. Krang, a mythic robot, is a perfect stompy creature, as he should be. Would it have been nice if <em>TMNT</em> was still a few months off? Yes. Would I have loved if we only got one Universes Beyond set per year? Absolutely.</p> <p>But Wizards is giving me everything I would have wanted from a <em>Turtle</em>s set. In the meantime, I’m going to go grab a pie and a two liter and fire up the excellent <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Flood plain, fire risk, black mold, and it's going to fall into the ocean."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has partnered with real estate website Zillow to create Zillow for Warcraft, a goofy Zillow-like website intended to promote the game's new player housing feature with humor, information, and a free in-game item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website, accessible at <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillowforwarcraft.com</a> or <a href="https://zillow.com/warcraft" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillow.com/warcraft</a>, is, to be clear, a goof. At the moment, it doesn't seem to be showing off actual houses built by real players. It instead has a curated selection of both Horde and Alliance homes that seem to be intended more to offer inspiration to players working on their own homes than anything. Besides, it's not like you can actually buy someone else's fully built and decorated house in the game, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website is cute, though. It's got a handful of different housing options on different plots in both the Horde and Alliance neighborhoods to skim through, with humorous descriptions of decor decisions and, frankly, some pretty good ideas that I hadn't really thought of for my own rustic shack. You're guided through the website by Bek'tar Donhammar and Hazyl Fizzlehorn, two fictional Azerothian real estate agents who each have their own profiles with "reviews" from satisfied customers, all rife with in-jokes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main reason you might care to visit the website, though, is to get the free item. If you link your battle.net account, you can get a free "Naturally Elegant Doormat" which will show up in the in-game mail after the fact and become available for use in decorating your house. It's not a bad doormat! Worth the, like, four clicks it takes to get it. Once you have one, you can also buy more copies of it from Tuuran and Gabbi near the Trading Posts in Stormwind and Orgrimmar, in case you want a house just full of mats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps even more delightful than just clicking around on the website though are some of the player reactions to the feature. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/zillow_teams_with_world_of_warcraft_for_player/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> about the announcement, a number of individuals have popped in to offer pleasant snark about the crossover, generally mixed in with commentary about how expensive real-life houses are nowadays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"last sold in ‘88 for 49,000, now going for 449,000, cool cool cool," reads the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5uwst8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top comment by u/Helios420A</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hasn’t had work done since Blackhand was Warchief," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5wmdnm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes u/Thesleek</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Does this mean blackrock will somehow get involved next?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5ux553/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked u/notmyworkaccount5</a>, making a very well-placed pun on BlackRock Inc, the investment company, and Blackrock, the World of Warcraft orc clan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have my doormat, I will proceed to log in and rearrange my living room for the umpteenth time, wasting several hours before finally admitting I will never make anything as magical as the <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/#/homedetails/alliance-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ban'ethil Bohemian</a>, and go back to adding spikes to my roof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is in a bit of a Schrödinger's cat situation. That's because at the time of writing, the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">official site</a> only shows the shooter's logo, and text that reads "This site is currently unavailable. Please contact support@codethirtytwo.com for assistance," alongside links to its official Discord server and Dwitter page. This, of course, could just be a blip, but even as I'm writing this it's been the case for several hours, and there's not a single word from developer Wildlight about why it's down. So, it is both dead and not dead until someone opens the box.
</p>
<p>
This obviously isn't an immediate confirmation that the game is shutting down, but given that last week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">most of the team was apparently laid off</a>, there is certainly reason to question whether this is that famed writing on the wall you so often hear about. The silence from Wildlight in both the game's Discord server and social pages certainly adds to the writing.
</p>
<p>
Parallel to all of this, a report has emerged from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment">Game File</a> that sheds a tidbit of light on how Highguard came to be. Namely, that the game was predominantly funded by Tencent. It's been unknown up to this point just who funded the game, given Wildlight's proud proclamation of independence.
</p>
<p>
The framing of Wildlight as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-devs-say-it-was-always-the-plan-to-go-dark-after-its-reveal-a-la-apex-legends-launch">indie studio</a> by founder Dusty Welch has been a sticking point for me since the moment I heard it, seeing as prior to the layoffs it was a 100+ person company. To hear a report that Wildlight were funded by a company as massive as Tencent doesn't offer me any sense of vindication, more frustration at the hubris at those at the top to think they can just repeat the success they previously had many years of changing industry trends later.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, here's hoping that those affected by the layoffs end up on their feet, and much the same to those who may or may not be out of work by the end of the week.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skyrim-switch-2-60fps-update-2000669806</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> on Switch 2</a> is looking and playing better after a new update added a much-requested 60FPS mode and plenty of fixes and tweaks to the game.</p> <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">Bethesda shadowdropped the 15-year-old open-world RPG <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. But unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">the last time the company surprise released an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game</a>, the reaction to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 wasn’t positive. Many players were upset over the game’s poor performance, visual glitches, bugs, and bloated install size. Well, Bethesda has fixed some of these problems with a new update out now on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">Bethesda released update 1.2 for <em>Skyrim</em> on the Switch 2</a>. The big news is that this free patch added a 60FPS performance mode. Bethesda has also locked <em>Skyrim</em>‘s framerate to 30FPS when playing in “Prioritize Visuals” mode. Either choice should provide a smoother, more stable experience compared to what <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 played like previously.</p>

 <p>In the patch notes for the update shared online on February 17, Bethesda also dedicated two different sections to addressing fixes made to the game’s performance and visual bugs. This includes improved performance in certain areas, like the Talking Stone giant camp and during combat at Secunda’s Kiss. Issues with water not looking correct from a distance or while in a menu have been fixed, too.</p> <p>While it can be frustrating how often <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">Bethesda seemingly breaks their own classic RPGs with updates and ports</a>, I am happy that the studio seems committed to going back and fixing problems. And hey, if Bethesda doesn’t fix it, at least PC players can rely on talented modders to pick up the slack. Switch 2 and other console players are still at the mercy of Bethesda, though.</p> <hr> <p>Here are the full patch notes for the 1.2 <em>Skyrim</em> update on Switch 2:</p> <div dir="ltr"> <p><span

<h2>Reasons for worry</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thememorycore.com/gamehub-feb-11-2026/">a recent interview with The Memory Core newsletter</a>, GameSir admitted that its primary motivation for releasing a Windows emulation tool was to sell more of its controllers. But GameSir’s controllers aren’t required to use the Android version, which it says was sideloaded on 5 million (primarily Chinese) Android devices even before <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoji.egggame">its official Google Play release in November</a>.</p>

<p>GameHub on Android has also faced controversy for including a number of invasive trackers (which are <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gamehub-lite-3608539/">removed in a community-built Lite version</a>). A GameSir representative told The Memory Core that this was just standard practice in the Chinese market, where there is less sensitivity to such user tracking, and that it has since been removed.</p>
<p>The representative also addressed concerns about reusing open source compatibility code in that interview, saying that its Windows emulator was “developed in-house by GameSir’s core engineering team” with its “own in-house compatibility layer (such as syscall hooks, GameScopeVK, and other technologies), rather than modifications to Wine’s core code.” That said, the representative admitted GameFusion “reference[s] and use UI components from Winlator [an <a href="https://winlator.org/">open source Windows emulation tool for Android</a>]… to maintain ecosystem compatibility and familiarity.”</p>
<p>The compatibility issues and controversial corporate entity involved here probably mean that GameHub for Mac won’t be the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">Valve SteamOS/Proton moment</a> that Apple gamers have been waiting for. Still, it’ll be nice for MacBook owners to have yet another option to play Windows games without needing to run a Windows install.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee and streaming giant Netflix have inked another streaming deal. The tabletop giant has signed global rights for official Ticket to Ride movie and TV shows to the streaming platform, bringing even more potential cinematic board game adaptations.</p><p>According to an official press release, this Ticket to Ride movie and TV deal secures exclusive global rights to adapt the board game series into scripted and unscripted projects across film, TV, and additional formats.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This deal is similar to another one struck by Asmodee and Netflix in October of 2025. That deal secured similar rights to another beloved Asmodee board game franchise, the resource-gathering social game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/netflix-catan-movie-and-tv-rights-secured-bringing-scavenging-and-diplomacy-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan</em></a>.</p><p>The press release confirms the first project under this deal will be an official <em>Ticket to Ride</em> movie. The film will be written by Ben Mekler (<em>Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts)</em> and Chris Amick (<em>Final Space</em>), and producers will include Asmodee's own Darren Kyman, Eric and Kim Tannenbaum, and Jonathan Levine and Gillian Bohrer.&nbsp;</p><p>This deal is another step in Netflix's more recent push for creating content out of recognizable board game IP. It aligns with deals to make streaming material out of the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow"><em>Clue</em></a> and <em>Catan</em>. It's also consistent with already produced tabletop game movies and shows such as <em>Exploding Kittens</em> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Family Pack</em></a>, an adaptation of T<em>he Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em>.</p><p>The Ticket to Ride movie deal with Netflix does raise the question: how would you adapt it. <em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a game where players compete to collect and connect various train routes through major cities, scoring points for completing routes. It's essentially a top-down competitive management experience, which is difficult to express in film which tends to err on human scale struggles.</p><p>There's also the fact that the importance of train routes and railways is very cultural and historical. Do you make it a period piece about the rise of the rail? If so, which country do you center on? Is the tone wondrous, in keeping with the board game's kid friendliness, or a more cynical take? Those are the challenges the screenwriters will need to address one way or another.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/riftbound-origins-review-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70845ca1-ba9b-48fd-ae51-be30d1b4ed06" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em> TCG</a> has now released its second set, expanding the number of Legends from <em>LoL</em> that you can let lead your deck alongside additional new mechanics. In our review of <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>, we'll take a look at some of the new mechanics and how they'll power a deck along with the new <em>Spiritforged </em>keywords and how they shift the battlefield.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>Equipment</h2><p dir="ltr">Equipment is a new type of gear card that has been added to <em>Spiritforged</em>. This Gear has a cost to be played, but then an additional cost to be equipped to your units.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment opens up a whole new level of augmentation in <em>Riftbound </em>letting you take fighters that might have not quite been viable, but give them a chance to have their Might boosted or alter other elements of the card.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment can give a Unit a few more Might to help them on the battlefield, additionally you can have equipment that will turn a Unit into a different type such as a mech. This kind of augmentation is extremely important for decks like the Rumble Champion Deck.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-equipment.jpg?itok=AQSwl3us 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I've gotten lost early on in a number of TCG because of how quickly new elements are added, and how quickly it invalidates any of the older cards. With equipment, not only are all cards getting an upgrade, but the changes that equipment can have on a card also open up a variety of possibilities where cards that wouldn't be viable before are now able to be played.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>New Keywords</h2><p dir="ltr">Five different Keywords have been added with <em>Spiritforged</em>. These expand the kinds of effects that cards will have as you play them, by keywording them they're faster to understand and respond to.</p><p dir="ltr">The first new Keyword is Echo, you'll see these appear on spell cards. The effect of Echo is that you can repeat the effect of a spell by paying an additional cost that's listed on the card. This is an easy way to let a spell have a standard level of effect in the early game, but as you build up more Runes, you're able to unleash more havoc with them as the game goes on.</p><p dir="ltr">In my few games playing with the effect, I loved the versatility of these cards and that by using them at different scales, you could do more or less with your turn. It wasn't a spell that was useful at the beginning of the game, but not impactful by the end of the game, and it also wasn't a card that felt useless in my hand if drawn too early.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-unique.jpg?itok=YVkI-bjN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The second new Keyword is an interesting one, Unique. This card effect means that you can only have a single copy of the card in your deck. This effectively moved what other TCG might call a Restricted list into the Keywording on the card itself. It has the dual effect of meaning a player won't need to know the ins and outs of a ban-list to know if they've built their deck legally, alternatively a card with Unique as a Keyword is certain to immediately catch a player's eye, as they might come up with a strategy to unleash this powerful card.</p><p dir="ltr">The final three new Keywords that were introduced in <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> have to do with the new Equipment type; Quick-Draw, Equip, and Weaponmaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Equip has you simply paying the listed cost to attach a piece of equipment to a Unit, Quick-Draw lets that equipment as a reaction, attaching it to a unit you control immediately. These are keywords that define how to activate and equip your equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">The Weaponmaster Keyword is one that you'll find on Units. This lets you summon a unit and then attach equipment to it immediately, whether it's in your base or attached to a different unit for one recycle less than the cost listed on the card.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-battlegrounds.jpg?itok=9krrPVpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I am a big fan of the equipment mechanic, but also the different speeds you can implement for getting Equipment on the field, and in the hands of your Units. It was also incredibly helpful that, outside of playing and equipping these cards normally, you could either have it react faster with an ability of the equipment or an ability of a Unit. This gives a healthy level of flexibility when building your deck around equipment and how to best get it onto your field.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Has <em>Riftbound </em>Evolved?</h2><p dir="ltr">The aspect of Spiritforged that I think I'm most excited about is that elements have been added to the game, adding powerful but Unique cards and involving equipment to augment your current cards, but overall it hasn't invalidated the <em>Riftbound </em>cards from the initial set.</p><p dir="ltr">So often I watch new TCG sets release where a new set means everything prior is out sped or overpowered by new cards coming out.<em> Riftbound Spiritforged</em> feels like it has instead elevated the whole game, meaning you can take your old deck and make slight changes and bring it into competition with the latest cards instead of having to completely remix your approach to the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> is an evolution of the formula. There are more Legends, and more permutations on how you can approach building a deck with new mechanics, but nothing you previously had is left in the dust.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to continue to play your favorite deck and Legend, you can use this set to introduce Equipment to have them hit harder, or substitute cards in with new abilities without invalidating all of the cards you already own.</p><p dir="ltr">The flip side of this is that there really are so many different Legends with different abilities that if there wasn't a strategy that was previously speaking to you, there probably is now.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest issue I still have with pulling booster packs of Riftbound is how few Runes you receive, and how many Battlegrounds you get instead. Especially when trying to start your initial Rune collection it can be rough to see so few come out of packs.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Riftbound Spritforged was reviewed with cards provided by the publisher</strong></em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

Normally $49.99, you can currently buy the hardcover version for $41.08 (about $9 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metroid-Prime-1-3-Retrospective-Official/dp/1913330273?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMetroid-Prime-1-3-A-Visual-Retrospective-The-Official-Art-and-Making-of-Metroid-Prime-1-3-Hardcover-9781913330279%2F14437707119" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, which is one of the first discounts we’ve seen on the tabletop book.</p><p>Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, Piggyback’s 210-page retrospective is an excellent homage to the last 20 years of <em>Metroid</em>. The book itself resembles a piece of art, stitched-bound in a canvas-like cloth hardcover, with a red embossed outline of the series’ iconic protagonist, Samus Aran. Inside, you’ll find a trove of concept drawings and sketches spanning the entire trilogy — as well as <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> — including detailed illustrations of environments, common enemies, and bosses. It even features concept art that never made it into the final games.</p><p>What really makes the book stand out are the behind-the-scenes stories, however. It touches on everything from Retro Studios’ burnout upon shipping <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em> to insights surrounding Nintendo’s secretive development process. The margin notes from series producer Kensuke Tanabe are especially entertaining, as they reveal design debates from over two decades ago.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDMx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sheena Vasani</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/821108/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective-art-book-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

Having seen just some of the cards included, though, I’m impressed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic’s New Turtle Power Precon Looks Awesome</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I should preface this ‘precon preview’ with an explanation that in our behind-closed-doors look at the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set, Wizards revealed around a dozen cards from the Turtle Power precon - but there are more reveals to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means we’ve not been able to see how the deck plays, but we do know that your Commander of choice can be any of the Turtles, two of them partnered up with the Partner ability, or all five with the Heroes in a Half Shell card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s nothing truly revolutionary about this modular approach (swapping Commander precons to use other Legendary Creatures within them as their leader is part of the fun of the format), but having five options for Turtles means that no one is left behind.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the likes of Splinter (who has the Partner mechanic, too), but also members of the TMNT’s rogues gallery like Baxter, Fly in the Ointment, Leatherhead, Iron Gator, and, of course, Shredder, Shadow Master.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also some fun nods to the gaming history of the awesome foursome. Electric Seaweed from the hard-as-nails NES game makes an appearance to strike fear into gamers of a certain age, while other cards reference the squad’s love of arcade machines, like High Score and, uh, Arcade Cabinet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the deck play well?

"Huh." This, as admiringly as I can make this sound, was the first thought I thunked when I put down the demo for Titanium Court. Here is a game that is many things. The first thing it is is a play, in perhaps a literal sense, perhaps as a tool to immediately allow one to suspend their sense of disbelief at everything that is about to follow. We're watching a play, a narrative vehicle where anything can happen as long as what's on stage is convincing enough to make us believe it's happening. And truthfully, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what did happen.
</p>
<p>
Right, so, the genre descriptors, let's establish those. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, sure. Then it's also a match three game, which is where the wheels are forced to start turning. You find yourself at the center of the Titanium Court, a single tile on a field of many. There are mountains, forests, rivers, and other courts (evil, nasty courts filled with Them) who want to kill you. Not during the match three portion, however, during that section you match until you run out of moves, gathering up resources to then use to send out farmers to collect more resources, or soldiers to destroy Them and their courts, as a timer runs down until you either win or die trying.

These are the mechanics as they were presented to me, and they're all very neat and tidy. It's the thing that surrounds the mechanics, the surreal, almost Hylicsian quality to the story. By Hylicsian I mean that the world does not do you the kindness of explaining itself. There is a tutorialisation of the gameplay, sure, but the characters, including the likes of a very hungry cat and a man who can only answer questions you haven't asked, do not act as emitters of exposition. You must take what you are given, and figure out what to do with it.
</p><p>
There's very much an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alice-in-wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> quality to it all as well, a feeling of characters talking at you, putting you, or I suppose the nameless woman (an understudy in the play) in the role of queen, adding on all the expectations that comes with it. Undoutably it would be remiss of me to not frame it as at least somewhat Lynchian, though in a direction entirely of its own making. It is a game you can only describe as odd, or alluring, or maybe they're one in the same! Either way, I'm tickled pink by it, so I've thrown it on the ole wishlist, and you can do so too right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2364580/Titanium_Court/">here</a> (and check out its demo too!).

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/mtg-lorwyn-eclipsed-designers-talk-bringing-back-classic</link>
            <guid>1438762</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since last month's release of the latest <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, we've been busy blighting our goblins, turning our merfolk sideways, and spending <em>way</em> too much mana on Elementals. But I wanted to know what went into the design of the set, so I got the chance to chat with a few folks from the design team - read on for our interview about the creation of Lorwyn Eclipsed.</p><h2>Flavor First?</h2><p>I've heard the design team talk a lot in the past about designing cards that are either "flavor first" or "mechanics first," and I wanted to know which of these approaches was easier to build around, and how they approached this set.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=cOLhe5pX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=0IdyH3GU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>"It depends on the set," explains Mark Gottlieb, Principal Game Designer. "For example, returning to Kamigawa was more of a flavor-driven design - there was a pretty deep trope space to work with, plus the concept of tradition vs futurism led to a lot of designs."</p><blockquote><p>The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor ... is very solid and pretty universal...</p></blockquote><p>But as for Lorwyn, Gottlieb explains that the original set was inspired by Celtic folklore, which - while exuding a distinct vibe, didn't offer up a deep well of concrete tropes to play with. "The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, though—typal, hybrid, color-matters—is very solid and pretty universal," Gottlieb explains, "So I’d say Lorwyn Eclipsed was much more of a mechanic-driven design."</p><h2>What Stays, What Goes</h2><p>When bringing a set as beloved as Lorwyn back for the first time, it must have been difficult to decide what elements were important to implement vs. what could get left behind. "The question we asked ourselves," Gottlieb continues, "is 'What is definitional about Lorwyn?' And the same for Shadowmoor. What do people immediately think of as the identity of those sets?"</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=Hqo5sLY_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=pgkDXuK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Gottlieb says they ran an exercise of dissecting the original sets into their component parts, slicing them up into "Must have," "Nice to have," and "Don't need" categories. "The 'Must have' group," Gottlieb explains, "was mostly filled with broad mechanical space, like typal, hybrid, and -1/-1 counters. Most of the original keywords, though, like clash, reinforce, and conspire, didn’t carry the same weight."</p><h2>Aging Like A Fine Kithkin Wine</h2><p>Next I wanted to know in which ways, when designing the new set, did the team "feel the age" of the original Lorwyn block. Were there any mechanics, original designs, etc. that felt like they needed a serious update? &nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky," admits Gottlieb. "But we didn’t really think about the set in terms of 'Ugh, what do we have to fix?' The thought process was much more along the lines of 'What new and exciting things can we create out of the original sets’ elements that meet the moment for modern Magic?'"</p><blockquote><p>A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky...</p></blockquote><p>"Blight uses -1/-1 counters in a new, proactive way. Vivid takes advantage of hybrid in a way we haven’t before. We’d never had the opportunity to mash up Lorwyn and Shadowmoor elements before, since the story had previously kept them separate from one another." Gottlieb says that mindset gave the team the opportunity to come up with a whole new cycle of Elemental Incarnations, "as well as a new take on “champion” that takes advantage of newfangled 'behold' technology."</p><h2>Saying Goodbye To The Block</h2><p>To that end, I wondered if there were any challenges that came from designing this set as a single release, when we had a whole block with the setting the last time we visited Lorwyn.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork.jpg?itok=c7zM2l9v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork.jpg?itok=ayX3Uqm4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>"Yes, absolutely," Gottlieb replies. "It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go. But the competition for space was a crucible, in a way. Only the best stuff could stay. Everything in the set had to earn its spot."</p><blockquote><p>It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go.</p></blockquote><p>Gottlieb went on to describe a particular challenge in their design, which was the fact the the mechanical spaces Lorwyn Eclipsed focuses on (creature types matter, color matters), involve, as he puts it, "universal elements among <em>Magic</em> cards. Just about every creature card has both color and creature types, but they don’t really speak to one another, and keeping track of eight creature types and five colors across your board state can be burdensome. So it was certainly difficult to balance the focus between those two pillars of the design."</p><h2>Getting The Band Back Together</h2><p>With a set with this kind of legacy, I was curious if any of the original designers came back for this set. "Yes, multiple designers overlapped the original sets and the new one," explains Gottlieb. "I was the Vision Design lead for Lorwyn Eclipsed, and I was the Rules Manager during Lorwyn, and was a member of the Shadowmoor design team."&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"Mark Rosewater worked on all five Lorwyn-based sets. Aaron Forsythe, Doug Beyer, Erik Lauer, and Mike Turian were involved in both the old and the new. But all the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history. And the Worldbuilding team did a spectacular job immersing us into the setting, which really helped everyone zero in on the tone we wanted to capture."</p><blockquote><p>All the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, I closed out my questions with my classic ender: Do you have a favorite card from the new set? Is there a card you don't think is getting enough attention yet that you think will be a powerful addition to limited, constructed, or Commander?</p><p>To this, Jadine Klomparens, Principal Game Designer chimed in. "I really like Mutable Explorer and think there’s a lot of potential for it to show up in strategies that are interested in ramp or low opportunity cost changelings, or both!" I agree - Mutable Explorer's one of my favorite cards in the set!</p><picture>

            <title><![CDATA[The Source Of Highguard‘s Mysterious Funding Was Reportedly Chinese Tech Giant Tencent]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790</link>
            <guid>1438750</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Developers at Wildlight Entertainment were very open about <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em>‘s development</a> back when it launched last month. Everything except where the money to make it came from. A week after mass layoffs at the studio, it’s come out that the source of funding for the hero shooter’s four-year development cycle may have been Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=155iz&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">new report by <em>Game File</em></a>. It claims Tencent studio group&nbsp;TiMi, responsible for online hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and military multiplayer shooter <em>Delta Force</em>, is the one backing Wildlight Entertainment.</p> <p>Wildlight was cofounded by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">ex-Respawn Entertainment veterans</a> who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But unlike many recent startups which happily publicize their investment backers, Wildlight has kept that fact a secret. When pressed about the studio’s funding last month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-30/-highguard-maker-wildlight-entertainment-talks-about-the-game-s-dramatic-launch">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, CEO Dusty Welch said, “We don’t really speak publicly about the business, and the economics and the financials of our company.”</p>

 <p>As <em>Game File</em> points out, it’s unclear why the relationship has been kept secret. Tencent is no stranger to investing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-world-s-biggest-game-company-just-keeps-getting-big-1826294558">in Western game studios</a> and companies. It has billions in holdings across companies big and small, from Larian Studios and FromSoftware to Epic Games and Ubisoft. Usually these are just partial financial stakes. In Wildlight’s case, TiMi appears to have been the primary backer.</p> <p>Questions about the funding have taken center stage following Wildlight’s layoffs last week and fan questions about just how much longer the live-service game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em> can continue</a> in its current state. It’s lost over 95 percent of concurrent players on PC from its peak at launch, even as an unknown pool continues to play on console.</p>

 <p>As a free-to-play shooter, its revenue comes entirely from in-game microtransactions for skins and battle passes, things players are much less likely to buy when they think a game won’t stick around. Wildlight has yet to update players on the game’s revised roadmap or future plans and today, <em>Highguard</em>‘s official website was discovered to <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">have been taken offline</a>.</p>

<p>As Highguard’s struggles continue amid collapsing player counts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at developer</a> Wildlight Entertainment, a new report has shed light on who was funding the game all these years.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, Chinese conglomerate Tencent was the “lead financial backer” of the studio. Specifically, it’s said that TiMi Studio Group is the main studio backing the game.</p>







<p>Up until now, the funders behind the game have been kept quiet. In past interviews, the studio has declined to comment on who was investing in the studio.</p>



<p>Totilo adds that neither Tencent nor Wildlight provided a comment on the matter by the time of publication. Insider Gaming has also reached out for comment, but has not received a response. </p>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26th to nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. Since then the game has seen its playerbase fall to under 2,000 peak concurrents on the platform. It has also received mixed reviews. </p>
