<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/as-arc-raiders-takes-off-developer-embark-defends-its-use-of-ai-tools">Embark caught some flak for this approach</a> (which was also used in the company's other major release, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/finals">The Finals</a>), to the extent that our friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer</a> took a stand and marked the game down for its use of GenAI.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">Automaton Media</a>, ARC Raider publisher Nexon has now added its voice to the mix, with CEO Junghun Lee telling Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game*Spark</a> that "it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI."</p>

<p>While Lee goes on to clarify that human creativity is the key ingredient even in a world dominated by AI, his initial statement has triggered a frosty reception from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> developer Necrosoft Games.</p>
<p>"Not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so," says the studio in a post on social media. "Demonschool is 100% human made."</p>
<p>Demonschool is a tactical RPG with a focus on swift combat that takes inspiration from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-persona-games-on-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Persona</a> series. It launches on November 19th. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-demonschool-is-a-love-letter-to-ds-games-and-italian-horror-movies">We previewed it back in 2022</a>, so give that a read if it sounds like it's up your street.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/16-cool-details-about-valve%E2%80%99s-new-steam-console-controller-and-vr-headset.1351885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">Valve announced not one, not two, but three new pieces of video game hardware</a>: The console-like Steam Machine, the Steam Frame VR headset, and the Steam Controller. All of this stuff launches sometime in 2026 (<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price unknown</a>) and works together, alongside the Steam Deck, to create what is shaping up to be an impressive Steam ecosystem that rivals anything from Xbox, PlayStation, Apple, or Nintendo.</p>

 <p>But announcing three pieces of gaming hardware in one day means there are a lot of information and interviews floating around. So I’ve read through all of it, as well as all of Valve’s own posts, to narrow down 16 interesting, cool, important, and fun details about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is bringing back Xbox 360-like faceplates</h2> <p>Valve’s new Steam console features a removable faceplate that reminds me a lot of the Xbox 360 faceplates from back in the day. Sadly, the company doesn’t sound committed to selling different plates, but they will be sharing all the files needed to 3D print your own. So I expect a lot of third-party plates will be available after launch. Oh, and Valve, you should totally sell this e-ink plate, please!</p>   <h2>Valve wants every game running at 4K60 on Steam Machine</h2> <p>“Our benchmark has always been that it should have enough performance to play every game on Steam at 4K60 when you do some sort of upscaling like FSR,” Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/steam-machine-specs-availability/">told<em> PC Gamer.</em></a> That’s a pretty big promise and likely will mean some newer, Unreal Engine 5 games will need to have their settings lowered a lot. But games from a few years ago, indie titles, and other similar titles should run like a dream on the device.</p>

 <h2>You can easily expand Steam Machine’s storage and even change the RAM</h2> <p>Valve has designed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">Steam Machine</a> to let you add more SSD storage easily if you so desire. You can also slap in a fast, high-performance SD Card to add more storage. And for those willing to open the console up a bit more, you can even replace the RAM, though Valve says this will be tricky and likely not something most people do.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is reportedly very, very quiet</h2> <p>According to <em>PC Gamer</em>, the Steam Machine is very quiet. Even while playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and standing close to the Steam console, it barely made any noise.</p> <h2>It’s also just a computer, if you want</h2> <p>Similar to the Steam Deck, Valve has designed the Steam Machine to be usable as a computer. Hook it up to a monitor, connect a mouse and keyboard, and you have a beefy little Linux-powered desktop PC that can run Steam and other software easily.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643621">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can wirelessly connect four Steam Controllers to the Steam Machine</h2> <p>Want to play a game with your pals on the Steam Machine? Well, good news: It supports four Steam Controllers at once without needing any extra dongles. Nifty stuff!</p> <h2>Steam Machine can run Windows, if you like that kind of thing</h2> <p>If you’re someone who prefers gaming on Windows, you can swap out SteamOS for Windows 11 and run that operating system instead. I wouldn’t recommend doing this, but hey, I’m not your dad.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine will be available in every country where the Steam Deck is sold</h2> <p>If you can legally buy a Steam Deck where you live now, you’ll be able to buy a Steam Machine, Frame, and Controller when they launch globally in 2026. Here’s the list of countries where the Steam Deck is currently for sale:</p> <ul id="658bd5bd-5531-4e7a-8de2-8daaef2adc91"> <li>USA</li> <li>Canada</li> <li>UK</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>France</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>Japan</li> <li>South Korea</li> <li>Taiwan</li> <li>Hong Kong</li> </ul> <h2>The Steam Deck, Controller, and Frame VR headset all work together</h2> <p>Valve is making a big deal about how all of these new Steam devices work together and connect in various ways. So you can, for example, stream a newer game from your Steam Machine to your Steam Deck. Or play a Steam Deck favorite of yours natively on the Steam Frame headset while using the Steam Controller completely wirelessly. And of course, all your Steam games and progress hop around seamlessly between every device.</p>

 <h2>Steam Controller’s thumbsticks sound very fancy</h2> <p>The Steam Controller includes <a href="https://tmrjoystick.com/">Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) thumbsticks,</a> which are even better, more reliable, and more precise than Hall Effect sticks.&nbsp;“They’re super responsive, meaning that we’re able to lower the default dead zone by more than half. And super reliable. They’ll keep drift at bay much, much, much longer. These things are super great,” Steve Cardinali, an engineer at Valve, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/steam-controller-specs-availability-hands-on/">told <em>PC Gamer.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>The Steam Controller fully supports gyro aiming</h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/how-gyro-support-was-added-into-the-new-steam-controller-is-a-typical-valve-story/">Here’s a fun story:</a> The Steam Controller features full gyroscopic control because one person at Valve is way into gyro aiming and moved his desk into the same place the device was being designed to help get the feature in the gamepad. All you fans of gyro aiming should thank that person if you get the chance.</p> <h2>Steam Frame is basically a Steam Deck on your face</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643622">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While they don’t run on the same hardware, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe">Steam Frame VR headset</a> runs the same OS as the Steam Deck and should feel familiar to anyone who has played Valve’s portable PC. And because it’s a standalone device that runs SteamOS natively, all your Steam Deck games can be played on it in a big virtual theater.</p>

 <h2>The new VR headset is built for streaming, so no more wires</h2> <p>While you can plug a Steam Frame into a computer, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/hands-on-steam-frame-impressions/">Valve has designed the device to be totally wireless</a>. It uses a dedicated 6 GHz connection via an included USB dongle to make sure your game is streamed perfectly to the headset. Those who have tried it out say it’s flawless, and the lack of cables is freeing in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All Steam Deck Verified games will instantly be Steam Machine Verified</h2> <p>Valve is expanding its Verified program with the launch of all this new hardware. So now games can be Steam Deck, Steam Machine, and/or Steam Frame Verified. And because the Steam Machine is so much more powerful than the Steam Deck and supports a controller experience, Valve is automatically marking all Steam Deck Verified games as Steam Machine Verified. That means this device will launch in 2026 with a shit-ton of games that should, in theory, just play without issue on it.</p> <h2>You can stream games from the Steam Machine to the Steam Deck</h2> <p>While someone is watching TV, you can use the Steam Machine to play a newer, more taxing game on your Steam Deck wirelessly via streaming. It’s like the Wii U is back, but actually good.</p>

<p>Rogue Piece is an exciting anime-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that is based on the ultra-popular anime series One Piece, while also taking inspiration from various other anime shows. Players progress through the game by exploring various islands, defeating enemies along the way to get stronger and level up. The enemies that players will have to face get stronger as the game progresses, which makes grinding that much harder, and that’s where Rogue Piece codes can be of use to players. The codes will provide players with some much-needed resources, which can be used to get stronger weapons and upgrade existing abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-rogue-piece-codes">How To Redeem Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rogue Piece Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Roblox games nowadays require players to complete certain steps before they’re able to redeem codes in the respective game. Some require players to follow the social media profiles of the developers, while others force players to join the game’s official Discord server before the code redemption feature gets unlocked for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece, however, doesn’t fall into the category. Redeeming codes in Rogue Piece is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes given above into the correct text box. For newer players of the game who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox menu ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Rogue Piece.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the ‘code’ text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Enter’ button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rogue-piece-codes">How To Get More Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<p>The developers of Rogue Piece often drop new codes during updates or special events, which means that the next set of codes could be released very soon. However, tracking the release of these codes can be a hassle, as it requires players to comb through the game’s social media handles or Discord server regularly. Instead, the easiest way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes would be to bookmark this page. We update this article immediately after any new codes are dropped, making it your one-stop shop for all things Roblox codes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Congratulations to Pikachu.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York Videogame Critics Circle has unveiled the winner of its annual Andrew Yoon Legend Award ahead of the New York Game Awards in January. And unlike past years, it's not going to an individual luminary from the video game industry. It's going to...the Pokémon franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a first in the award's ten-year history, with past winners including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy">Sam Lake</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-creative-head-neil-druckmann-to-receive-nyvgcc-legend-award">Neil Druckmann</a>, Phil Spencer, Tim Schafer, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/29/reggie-fils-aime-to-be-awarded-new-york-game-awards-legend-prize">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>. That's not to say the award hasn't been flexible in its definition before, though. In its first year, 2016, the award was given to a studio: Rockstar Games. And in 2021, the award was given to four people: Jerry Lawson, Hideo Kojima, Brenda Romero, and John Romeo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's still unusual to see the Legend award go to a franchise. On its website and in past years, the NYVGCC has described the award as going to "a game changer in the video games industry" and "those who have propelled the gaming world forward, celebrating their profound impact on an industry that continues to captivate and connect people worldwide." This year, the press release describes the award's purpose as to "recognize industry icons and organizations that exhibited a significant, sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per the NYVGCC, Pokémon was chosen as "an iconic staple of global popular culture, breaking through to video game and mainstream audiences in the mid-to-late 90s with a unique combination of collectibility, strong and approachable RPG gameplay and unparalleled character design." The release cites its $12 billion in global retail sales in 2024, over 489 million game copies sold since 1996, and the fact that it's one of the highest-grossing media franchises. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">gave the most recent Pokemon game, Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, an 8/10, saying it "finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokémon's 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How do you articulate the impact of a cultural phenomenon like Pokémon? ‘Legend’ is the only word that comes to mind,” said Harold Goldberg, the president and founder of NYVGCC. “For 30 years, the franchise has grown to become the most recognizable game series in the world and is beloved for its unique monster designs that have compelled players young and old to catch ‘em all. It is a tremendous honor to present the company with the Andrew Yoon Legend Award at our 15th celebration of the New York Game Awards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The award will be accepted by The Pokémon Company at the awards ceremony on January 18, and The Pokémon Company will be in attendance with "two fan-favorite Pokémon" characters available for fan photo opportunities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to NYVGCC for comment on the decision to honor a franchise this year and received the following official statement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Pokémon Company’s Legend Award heralds the second time the New York Game Awards has decided to honor an overall team over a single individual creator. The first was Rockstar Games in 2016. With their influence across entertainment, console and tabletop gaming for 30 years, we felt that the many people who work with The Pokémon Company deserve to share the prestigious Andrew Yoon Legend Award for our 15th anniversary." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>After starring in multiple Naughty Dog games, actor Troy Baker continues his working relationship with the studio for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The actor recently discussed working with director Neil Druckmann, what it feels like to not play the lead in a Naughty Dog game, and how he wants to have a career similar to Oscar-winner George Clooney.</p><p><a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/troy-baker-makes-first-comments-about-naughty-dogs-intergalactic-game-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to ComicBook</a>, Baker said one thing that's stayed the same working with Druckmann on Intergalactic after starring in The Last of Us series as Joel and as Sam in Uncharted 4 is that they still butt heads.</p><p>"Neil and I will always, it's our vibe," he said. "We just love to butt up against each other. We were doing a table read, and I was literally like, 'Why are you giving me shit right now? I'm asking you a question!' And everybody else is like, 'Our mom and dad are fighting, are we still going to Disneyland?' We're fine. We're fine!"</p><p>Baker didn't say exactly what he and Druckmann were clashing on, nor do we even know much about the character Baker plays in Intergalactic... or the story of the game, for that matter.</p><p>Also in the interview, Baker discussed playing a supporting role in Intergalactic after playing one of the leads in the Last of Us franchise. This time around, Baker said he's excited to sit back somewhat, with Tati Gabrielle's character, Jordan A. Mun, serving as the lead.</p><p>"I've had a hell of a career. This industry owes me nothing. What a ride. I don't think that I deserve or need any more," he said. "But I am enjoying it now, now that I understand more about game development, I enjoy the process more than I do the credit. So I'm enjoying the position that I have, which I still feel is a very important position with Intergalactic."</p><p>Intergalactic is in development now for PlayStation 5, and one of the things that Druckmann keeps saying about it is that it has the "deepest gameplay" ever for a Naughty Dog game, whatever that means. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not expected to release until 2027</a>. Naughty Dog may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><h2><strong>"I want to be like George Clooney"</strong></h2><p>Baker also discussed his career ambitions on a longer timeline, saying he wants to "be like George Clooney," the Oscar-winning actor whose career has spanned decades and many different genres.</p><p>"I want to have my Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? and my Michael Clayton, and some of his directing work too," Baker said. "He's just an amazing person. The things that he’s able to create and the reason why he continues to be in things like Oceans 11, Up in the Air, or The American is because people just want to work with him."</p><h2>Baker's career</h2><p>Baker may be best known for his roles in Uncharted and The Last of Us, but he's done much more beyond those two Naughty Dog franchises. He also played the main character, Booker DeWitt, in BioShock Infinite and Rhys in Tales from the Borderlands. Baker also voiced Talion in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Agent Jones in Fortnite. Baker is also known for portraying the villain Pagan Min in Far Cry 4 and Higgs in the Death Stranding series, and has voiced Batman in some Lego projects.</p><p>More recently, he played the iconic character Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Original Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-praises-troy-baker-and-the-lack-of-ai-for-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/1100-6529281/" data-ref-id="1100-6529281">praised Baker's performance in the game</a> and how he achieved it without AI.</p><p>In 2022, Baker partnered with a blockchain company called Voiceverse and was caught up in drama related to AI and plagiarism. He later <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/troy-baker-ends-partnership-with-nft-firm-and-says-sorry-for-hate-or-create-comment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cut ties with the company</a> and owned up to what he described as antagonistic remarks he made when the collaboration was first announced.</p><p>Baker is also a musician and has released multiple albums. On TV, he appeared in HBO's The Last of Us in a Season 1 episode as the cannibal <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/James" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">James</a>.</p>

		<p>Valve has announced three major bits of new hardware coming in 2026, with a PC called the Steam Machine, a new wireless VR headset called Steam Frame, and a brand new controller simply named the Steam Controller. The hardware will allow you to play all of your games in your Steam library from indie titles to AAA titles. Additionally, the Steam Machine will let you install apps and different operating systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steam Hardware Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

			<p>Epic has released Unreal Engine 5.7 to developers. This new version of the leading commercially available game-making engine introduces several improvements over previous releases, as well as some new features. </p>



<p>For example, the MegaLights feature, which was previously tagged as Experimental in earlier UE5 builds, has now moved to Beta. With it, developers are allowed to inject a much greater number of dynamic, shadow-casting lights into the scenes of their games to achieve effects such as realistic soft shadows from complex light sources, like area lights. This more scalable lighting workflow enables them to work more intuitively and create larger, richer, and more intricate worlds than ever before.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.7 also delivers a significant enhancement to visual fidelity, offering new support for directional lights, translucency, shadow casting for Niagara particles, and more accurate shading and shadowing on hair. Epic says developers can also expect better out-of-the-box performance, improved noise reduction, and reduced need for manual optimization of lights.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Another highlight of Unreal Engine 5.7 is undoubtedly Nanite Foliage (available as an Experimental feature). Previously, Nanite could not be used with foliage, but that's changed thanks to a new geometry rendering system powered by the so-called Nanite Voxels. These automatically and efficiently draw millions of tiny, overlapping elements that appear as a solid mass from a distance, such as tree canopies, pine needles, and ground clutter. This is achieved at stable frame rates, without cross-fades or pops, and without the need to author LODs. Nanite Foliage also uses Nanite Assemblies to reduce storage, memory and rendering costs, as well as using Nanite Skinning to determine dynamic behaviours such as wind response. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new Unreal Engine 5 also offers an updated Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework. It's now production-ready, featuring improved GPU performance and a new Editor Mode for easier customization.</p>



<p>This build provides developers with a production-ready version of Substrate, the system designed for creating complex, high-fidelity, physically accurate layered and blended materials. Lastly, Unreal Engine 5.7 adds an AI Assistant that provides helpful guidance directly in the Editor. A dedicated slide-out panel lets the user ask questions, generate C++ code, or access step-by-step guidance without having to leave the Editor.</p>



<p>There are many more fixes and improvements to other systems, such as Metahumans and the animation toolset. Read everything <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-5-7-release-notes">on this page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released a <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview. The second set in the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> TCG will introduce new cards, new gameplay mechanics, and feature certain Legends from across the popular franchise.</p>



<p>The <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview shows off a small handful of cards, some new prebuilt champion decks, and three new mechanics coming to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-preview-card-artwork.jpg?itok=WRs6_P1y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-preview-card-artwork.jpg?itok=FAyIjFtp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Equipment is a new card subtype. Equipment can be attached to to units to make them stronger. Interestingly, equipment sticks around even if even if the unit is killed. Gold is a new resource that you can "spend" to get a new resource called Power, which is a required cost for certain cards. Lastly, there is Repeat. A spell with this effect can be doubled if you pay the card's cost a second time.</p>

<p>Some of the cards in the <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview showcase some of these new mechanics. These include new Equipment cards such as <em>Guardian Angel</em>, <em>Dorian's Shield</em>, and <em>Sterak's Gage</em>. In keeping with his character, the cards featuring the Legend, Draven involves gaining and using Gold.</p>

<p>Notably, the assets in the preview do confirm at least two new champion decks. One will feature the dangerous duelist, Fiora. The other showcases the genius tinkerer, Rumble. As for how those particular decks will play is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are 12 new Spirit Blossum-themed Overnumbered cards in the set. These cards are tied thematically to the set, which involves the lifting of the veil between the mortal and spirit realms.</p>

<p>Riftbound launched last month and, despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-addresses-launch-issues-with-riftbound-origins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some launch issues</a>, has found its audience. It has entered a crowded space of other competitive card games such as <em>Magic The Gathering</em>, <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>. The Spiritforged set will launch in December 2025 in China, and in English-speaking regions February 2026.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In its new Steam Frame VR headset, Valve put dual audio drivers on each side in the included head strap. That puts the audio near your ears while you’re wearing it, and in my brief time trying the device at Valve’s headquarters recently, I thought the sound was just fine. But the choice to have those dual drivers also helps reduce audio vibrations, which helps the headset with tracking while you’re playing games in VR, Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Frame, like many other VR headsets, uses outward-facing cameras built into the main part of the headset for tracking. However, audio with good bass “induces vibrations into the headset,” which can affect that tracking, according to Selan. But on the Frame’s included head strap, the dual drivers per side are “mounted opposite to each other,” which creates “vibration cancellation inherent in the design.” That allows for “better tracking, even with good audio,” Selan says.</p><p>Pretty cool! The headset is modular, too, so theoretically, you might be able to use other head straps with other audio solutions later. It’s a really interesting headset — I recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">got to try it for myself</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/818599/valve-steam-frame-headset-speakers-head-strap-vibration-cancellation]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A funny thing happens when you stir up enough trouble in the tiny, open-world portions of <i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i>. If you indulge in showing off your uber vampiric parkour abilities and wield your other powers too openly, the music intensifies and sirens, followed by the sound of a helicopter, surround you as you, hopefully, are trying to hide. At first, it instills a sense of urgency, a panic. You have to find somewhere in the not-so-sprawling map of Seattle to hide away. The need to run, to disappear into the shadows, it’s kind of fun.</p>

 <p>The thing is, there are no police cars with sirens blazing. Stop and look: There are no helicopters. You’ll reach a game over screen if you continue to violate the vampiric code of silence known as the Masquerade, but aside from cops on the streets opening fire on you (who are hardly a threat given that you’re literally a 400-year-old vampire), so much of the sense of danger around you is nothing more than a shallow facade. It makes an otherwise beautiful slice of Seattle in snowy winter feel completely hollow.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643612" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643612"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643612">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Equally deflating, there are no lasting consequences for feeding on humans, killing them quietly, or indulging in your violent vampiric side.</p> <p>In the tabletop roleplaying game on which <i>Bloodlines 2</i> is based, players whose characters are vampires have to balance the bestial nature of vampirism with their efforts to hang onto what’s left of their humanity. It’s a core game mechanic, with a “humanity” meter that can grow or shrink depending on your actions. But it’s also fodder for the central themes of <i>VtM</i>, which many come to the game for: at what point are you no longer human? How and when have you fully given into the monster inside you that hungers, eternally so?</p>

 <p>There’s no hunger meter in <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, at least not one that reflects the concerns you have in the tabletop roleplaying game where your actions have an impact on the world around you as well as yourself. In <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, you’ll need to feed on humans if you’ve used too many powers in combat, but never does the game require you to concern yourself with the ethics of how you satiate that hunger.</p>

 <p>And sure, those vampiric powers can be a lot of fun. You can zip around enemies, snap their necks, telepathically pick up their guns to fire back at your enemies, toy with their minds by instilling fear or a sense of self-destruction, or even summon blades of blood to shoot at your foes. That part can be very cool.</p>

 <p>But the fun of that loop is fleeting at best and you’re left with nothing but a hollow diorama set in the world of <i>VtM</i>’s rich lore.</p> <p>That’s why it’s even more disappointing that, despite that fake feeling of the world around you, despite a game loop that tires quickly, there’s so much that <i>Bloodlines 2</i> does well that it feels like an undead variant of a better game that somehow withered away in its developmental slumber.</p>

 <h2>The soul of something vibrant trapped in a lifeless husk</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643609"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643609">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s sort of poetic that <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s protagonist, Phyre, is a 400-year-old vampire only recently awoken from a deep sleep, unsure of the reality they now live in. <i>Bloodlines 2</i> itself had a rough previous life, and it seems equally unsure of itself. The original <i>Bloodlines</i>, released in a shoddy state in 2004, required the work of countless modders and <i>VtM</i> enthusiasts to mold it into something acceptable. It remains a wonky game to this day.</p>

 <p>The sequel, as you may know, saw its first developer, Hardsuit Labs, dismissed from the project. The remains were picked up by <i>Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</i> developer The Chinese Room, as they used assets created by HSL and crafted an entirely new story set in a very small slice of Seattle.</p> <p>As we speak, those old assets and build materials from HSL’s work on the game have leaked out, and are leading many to speculate that something better was lost.</p>    <p>The speculation is fun, no doubt, but I think it also distracts from talking about the actual product that exists, what it fails to achieve and what it manages to do well. And going by the writing in <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, it’s clear that this could’ve been an excellent video game.</p>

 <p>There’s a lot to say about the story and writing of <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, how well it handles <i>VtM</i>’s themes and lore, how the Johnny-Silverhand-of-a-situation that Phyre and the co-protagonist who lives in their head find themselves in sparks great dialogue (and excellent voice performances) and narrative direction. But I often find myself thinking about a particular NPC named Patience, a Toreador clan vampire who I consider a brilliant take on the obsessed artist archetype.</p> <p>Patience is almost always found in the backroom of a pawn shop which is owned by another fascinating character, Niko Anelov. In most <i>VtM</i> media, Toreadors are portrayed as upper-class divas, obsessed with themselves and their objects of desire. There’s literally a mechanic for this in the TTRPG: a Toreador can become fixated on what they find beautiful to the point where their monstrous nature enables them to do horrible things in pursuit of having that beauty.</p>

 <p>It’s common enough that those beautiful objects are “high art,” or things that many would regard as conventionally beautiful or sexually attractive. Patience, as a Toreador, is very obsessed in a similar way, but it’s trash that calls to them, the trash left behind at a pawn shop specifically. They wish to collect it and work with it as a kind of found media, seeing beauty in the act of something left behind, forgotten, misplaced, discarded. On one hand, it’s refreshing to see a character like this. On the other, Patience could be viewed as an egotistical hipster scrounging up garbage to masquerade as art, not quite unlike the stuffy elite Toreadors holed up in art galleries and opera houses. Who are they really? I love that riddle about them.</p> <p>I tend to prefer Malkavian clan types myself, but this Toreador? One conversation with them sees Phyre ruminating over whether Patience’s art is about “mortality” or “individualism.” It’s the kind of moment I love in a good tabletop game of <i>VtM</i>. Yes, there’s the gory lore and the sex and the thrill of being powerful, but stopping to ask a vampire artist if their work, which they will continue to toil away with for eternity, is a statement of their own individuality or a commentary on the nature of death? That’s what I’m here for. Those are the deep, endless riddles that I love cracking open with the sharp object that is the vampire as metaphor.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000643608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643608"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643608">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But alas, Patience, my beautiful trash Toreador, will just stand around in the world, lifeless, unless I talk to them. And the quest they give me? It’s just to collect some items which, while they’re connected to the story, feel like a Ubisoft-ified collect-a-thon. I’ve gathered all the items they requested, but these knickknacks don’t appear in their studio, or on their work. It was all just a checkmark on the game’s map.</p>

 <p>Lifeless, hollow, I leave Patience to do their work of…standing there, as I return to the equally lifeless sirens and helicopters of Seattle. The world will blare sirens at you that don’t exist, and Patience will speak of a vibrant, countercultural artistic practice you rarely see outside of what exists in a permanent, rigid state in their studio.</p> <p>I’ve yet to cross the finish line on <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s story. I feel compelled to do so because the characters are excellent, and the way it’s using the lore of <i>Vampire: The Masquerade </i>and the thematic nature of the vampire has potential. But the execution, that’s the stake through the heart.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>You don't see a lot of coin pusher arcade machines anymore. <em>Raccoin: Coin Pusher Roguelike</em>, from developer Doracoon and<em> Balatro</em> publisher Playstack, is played within one.</p><p>The decline of coin pusher arcade machines came with increased restrictions on real-money prizes for largely luck-based games—i.e., gambling—and the closure of arcades themselves. A child of the '90s, I spent a lot of time in arcades putting tokens into coin pushers. The one at my local arcade was brightly lit with lots of vibrant colors, set up with six different stations so multiple people could play at once. No strategy in mind, I'd bounce between setups tossing coins into the machine at entirely random intervals, hoping one would eventually pay off.</p><p>The thing about the coin pusher is that its prizes—largely more coins, which equal tickets—always look tantalizingly close to the edge. Just one more coin! Coins or tokens are inserted into the machine and slide onto a moving shelf. The idea is that the new coins, laid flat behind the mess of coins in front, cause a chain reaction when the shelf moves. The coins closest to the edge fall off the shelf, onto another playing field with more coins. And then newly fallen coins then continue the cycle: When the shelf moves, coins at the edge of the machine fall into the prize slot. If you do it right, perhaps, you'll win a ton of coins—an avalanche of coins.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Doraccoon/Playstack</span></figcaption></figure><p>A demo version of the game is playable now on Steam, and it's exactly the experience I'd always hoped a coin pusher would be. There are lots of coins—so, so many—and with a little strategy, you'll be raining coins into the prize slot repeatedly. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Doraccoon lays it out quite plainly in its Steam description</u></a>: "It's a nonstop dopamine rush packed into one unpredictable, coin dropping ride."</p><p>From a moving chute, you'll drop coins into the game quickly and generously. Where <em>Raccoin</em> strays away from the traditional coin pusher is that it's also a roguelike with lots of different modifiers designed to create huge payouts. The different items, abilities, and coins combine to shift the playing field and enhance effects. These are unlocked gradually, as the goals of your runs get higher. You're able to get through the first through levels of the demo without much strategy, but you'll need one in the later levels. Some coins do things like create an explosion. One item creates a black hole that sucks coins in.</p><p>But <em>Raccoin</em>'s strategy can get pretty complicated when you start thinking about the ways coins can interact with each other, much like a <em>Balatro</em> run with its different joker cards. So, for instance, you can combine coins that represent seeds with water coins or with a fertilizer item to create coin trees. Spam that even more by using a special prize that rains down your most purchased coin—if you've done things right, that should be the seed coin—to take it even further.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Doraccoon/Playstack</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you end up with is an absolutely constant cascade of coins overflowing into the prize slot, lighting up the machine with the satisfying sound of coins clinking around. Shaking the arcade machine won't get you kicked out of the arcade, either: It's just another way to hear that gratifying sound.</p><p><em>Raccoin</em>'s demo is available now on Steam, but there's no release date announced just yet. The demo is just a fraction of what will be available in the full game, allowing you to unlock two separate characters, 50 different coins, and 60 ability items. It's more than enough to keep me busy until the game's out; it's got the same sort of feel as <em>Balatro</em> in that it's hard to step away. Just like the coin pushers of my youth, I find myself saying: just one more coin.</p>

It’s called foveated streaming, and it means the headset requests a higher-quality image for the content that’s right in front of your eyes while lowering the resolution of your peripheral vision to reduce bandwidth and processing demands.</p><p>The headset relies on a couple pieces of hardware to make that happen. The first is a dedicated wireless streaming adapter that sends games from a PC to the headset. The second is a pair of eye-tracking cameras inside the headset that follow where you’re looking. If you’re familiar with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12260430/nvidia-foveated-rendering-vr-graphics-smi-eye-tracking-siggraph">foveated rendering</a>, which headsets like Apple’s Vision Pro deploy for on-device processing, it’s a similar idea.</p><p>Valve tells <em>The Verge</em> that foveated streaming won’t be exclusive to the Frame. While it’s currently optimized for the Steam Frame, foveated streaming can work with “any headset that supports eye tracking” and that is “compatible with our Steam Link streaming app,” according to hardware engineer Jeremy Selan.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th.

While playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> on a Steam Frame streamed from a nearby PC with that dedicated 6GHz wireless streaming adapter, I honestly couldn’t tell that the game wasn’t running locally on the headset. While Valve hasn’t specified when foveated streaming might be available on other headsets or which might be able to use it, I’m glad to hear that owners of other VR headsets will be able to use the feature to play their games.</p><p>It doesn’t sound like Valve has plans for other VR headsets to be able to take advantage of the wireless adapter, though. “Supporting the wireless adapter is more difficult without lower-level OS support, as we have with SteamOS,” Selan says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/817993/valve-vr-steam-frame-foveated-streaming-rendering-link]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-new-steam-machine-might-resemble-a-gamecube-but-its-design-ethos-actually-began-with-its-fan.1351789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-console-steam-frame-trademark-rumor/">several rumors</a> surrounding Valve, claiming that the company would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-may-announce-steam-frame/">launching a new VR headset, controller</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-rumored-to-announce-something-big-shortly/">potentially even a new console-like PC</a>, those rumors were proven true today when Valve announced all three of the rumored hardware devices in one big swing. The Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">were all debuted at once, and they're all going to arrive sometime in early 2026</a>.</p>



<p>What has followed since the official reveal is a slew of interviews and videos from publications that got the chance to speak with Valve ahead of the reveal, including a particularly interesting interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-how-did-valve-design-the-steam-machine-it-started-with-the-fan-of-course">Eurogamer</a> where Yazan Aldehayyat, a hardware engineer at Valve, spoke candidly about how the company settled on the design of the Steam Machine.</p>



<p>Before you ask, no, it did not come from Valve wanting to make its own Nintendo GameCube (though that hasn't stopped people online from referring to the device as the Gabe Cube or Steam Cube). It began with Valve seriously considering the cooling and heat challenges that the Steam Machine would face, whether on a person's desk or, more likely, on a TV stand in their living room.</p>



<p>"<em>If you know how much heat you need to remove and what temperatures you're dealing with, then you know how much air you need</em>," said Aldehayyat. "<em>And if you know how much air you need, you can lock in a fan design pretty early on. And if you know how big the fan is, everything else kind of falls [into place] from that</em>."</p>



<p>Aldehayyat goes on to say that "<em>Living rooms are actually one of the most challenging thermal environments you can think of</em>," due to how devices, whether they're consoles or a small media box, are usually tucked into cabinets or surrounded by other sources of heat, and not just things like a TV, but potentially a fireplace warming someone's living room and giving devices like the Steam Machine a greater cooling challenge.</p>



<p>Obviously, Valve can only do so much to try and accommodate for those kinds of variants, but it's not surprising that the design for its new console-like PC came from wanting to both improve on the performance capabilities of a Steam Deck, without shipping a massive device that might as well just be a desktop at a certain point. Besides, Nintendo proved years ago that consoles don't need to be these giant boxes or towering configurations of plastic and technology to be popular and perfect for the living room.</p>



<p>Lastly, just as a comparison, the Steam Machine is 152 mm tall, 162.4 mm deep, and 156 mm wide, while the Nintendo GameCube is 110 mm tall, 161 mm deep, and 150 mm wide. It's flat-out impressive, and a huge sign of how far technology has come, that with a few more millimetres of space compared to a console that launched in 2001, Valve can make a device capable of playing modern games 25 short years later.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/818041/valve-steam-frame-vr-headsets-comparison</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-the-steam-frame-compares-to-other-vr-headsets.1351786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve just announced the Steam Frame, a new standalone VR headset that can both stream games from a PC and play games locally thanks to an onboard Arm chip. The headset is quite a bit different from Valve’s previous model, the Index, which had to be tethered to a gaming computer with a physical wire. But it also stands out from a lot of other major VR headsets on the market right now, like the Meta Quest 3, Samsung Galaxy XR, and Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>A big way the Frame separates itself from the pack is its focus on streaming your games. That’s all made possible thanks to a wireless dongle that comes with every Frame: plug it into your PC, and you can stream both your flat and VR games to the headset over a low-latency connection. I got to try the streaming for myself at Valve’s headquarters while playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, and I didn’t notice any discernible lag.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Category</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Frame</h3></th><th><h3>Meta Quest 3</h3></th><th><h3>Apple Vision Pro</h3></th><th><h3>Samsung Galaxy XR</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Colors</td><td>Black</td><td>White</td><td>Silver</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (grams)</td><td>185g (core unit), 440g (with head strap that adds audio and rear battery)</td><td>515g</td><td>750–800g (depending on light seal and headband configuration)</td><td>545g, though weight may vary if you wear the light shield or not</td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>SteamOS</td><td>Meta Horizon OS</td><td>visionOS</td><td>Android XR</td></tr><tr><td>Lenses</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td></tr><tr><td>Screen type</td><td>LCD</td><td>LCD</td><td>micro-OLED</td><td>micro-OLED</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>2160 x 2160 per eye</td><td>2064 x 2208 per eye</td><td>3660 x 3200 per eye</td><td>4K per eye</td></tr><tr><td>Refresh rate</td><td>72-144Hz refresh rate (144Hz experimental)</td><td>72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz</td><td>90Hz, 96Hz, 100Hz, 120Hz</td><td>60Hz, 72Hz (default), up to 90Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</td><td>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2</td><td>Apple M5 chip</td><td>Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</td></tr><tr><td>FOV</td><td>Up to 110 degrees</td><td>Up to 100 degrees horizontal and 96 degrees vertical</td><td>Estimated to be about 100 degrees</td><td>109 degrees horizontal and 100 degrees vertical</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB unified LPDDR5 RAM</td><td>8GB</td><td>16GB, reportedly</td><td>16GB</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>256GB / 1TB UFS storage options, microSD card slot</td><td>512GB</td><td>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td>256GB</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi 7, includes dedicated Wi-Fi 6E adapter for low-latency streaming games</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E</td><td>Wi‑Fi 6</td><td>Wi-Fi 7</td></tr><tr><td>Tracking, passthrough, and sensors</td><td>4 outward-facing monochrome cameras forcontroller and headset tracking, 2 interior cameras for eye tracking, outward IR illuminator</td><td>2 RGB cameras with 18 PPD for full-color passthrough</td><td>2 high‑resolution main cameras, 6 world‑facing tracking cameras, 4 eye‑tracking cameras, TrueDepth camera, LiDAR Scanner, 4 inertial measurement units (IMUs), flicker sensor, ambient light sensor</td><td>2 high-resolution passthrough cameras, 6 world-facing tracking cameras, 4 eye-tracking cameras, 5 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), depth sensor, flicker sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Eye tracking</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Battery capacity</td><td>21.6Wh</td><td>19.44Wh</td><td>Up to 2.5 hours of “general use”</td><td>Up to 2 hours of “general usage”</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>TBA</td><td>$499.99</td><td>$3,499.00</td><td>$1,799.99</td></tr><tr><td>Availability</td><td>Early 2026</td><td>October 2023</td><td>October 2025</td><td>October 2025</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You can also play games right on the Frame itself because Valve has gotten SteamOS working on Arm; the headset is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. Other headsets can play games locally, too — typically games built specifically for their respective platforms. But the Frame is actually able to run Windows x86 code and recompile it in real time using an emulator, meaning that a vast amount of the Steam library will be playable directly on the headset without you or any developers having to do anything.</p><p>That said, you shouldn’t expect to be able to play high-end games locally on the Frame. Valve designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em> that developers should target lower performance than they would for a game on Steam Deck. The Frame’s real-time emulation could affect performance; while playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Hades II</em> on the headset, both of which are relatively lower-end games, I saw some stutters that I never see on my Steam Deck. (According to Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan, this was a bug and the company expects to make improvements leading up to and after launch.)</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

How about that Steam Machine, 'ey? Consoles are now computers and computers are now consoles. What a topsy turvy world we're living in! I'm sure you have lots of questions, a lot of which I hope can be answered by James' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">hands-on look at the thing</a>, but you may still be wondering how you'll know what games will actually work on it. The Steam Deck has its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">fancy verified badge</a> that certifies that a game runs on the handheld, and it turns out that same badge is one that'll come in handy for the Steam Machine.
</p>
<p>
In a stunningly brief <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/563639634283728255">blog post</a> from Valve discussing its trio of hardware announcements, there's also a bit about what this all means for developers. No, don't run away, it's relevant to you too! Valve explains that its verified program will be expanded to include both the Steam Machine and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, promising more details soon. However! As they note, "if your games are already Steam Deck Verified, they'll automatically be verified on Steam Machine."
</p>
<p>
Essentially, it does sound like there will be unique verified badges for the Machine and the Frame, but any games you've hoarded for your Steam Deck thus far that are Steam Deck verified are already ready to go on that Steam Machine you've already bought in your head.
</p>
<p>
For those of you that actually are developers, Valve also says that they've launched a Steam Frame developer kit program. Apparently they're quite limited, but the company does plan to send kits out on an "ongoing basis."
</p>
<p>
So, when the next Steam sale approaches, and you notice that out of your list of 20 games, 17 of them are Deck verified, you can purchase safely knowing that they'll also be playable on Valve's sort-of-console. I'm sure this will help with your religious-scripture-length backlog.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Rumours have been rumbling about Valve — the Washington-based developer responsible for creating Steam, but for also bringing us some of the best games ever made such as <strong>Half-Life</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a>, and <strong>Counter Strike</strong> — announcing some brand new hardware for a few days now.</p>
<p>And earlier today, multiple press outlets have revealed they've gone hands-on with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/hardware">three new pieces of Steam-compatible kit</a>: a brand new controller, a "streaming-first" headset, and what is basically a game console. The Steam Controller, Steam Frame, and Steam Machine, to give them their proper names.</p>
<p>And while the controller and headset look cool, the Steam Machine is the one that's caught most people's eyes, and for good reason: it looks an awful lot like a GameCube, doesn't it?</p>
<p>The resemblance is pretty striking. The Steam Machine is just a little black cube, measuring at approximately 6-inches, just a little bigger than our favourite purple 'Cube from the 00s, which comes in at 5.9 × 6.3 × 4.3 inches (sans the Game Boy Player, though the Steam Machine looks like it <em>basically</em> has one of those).</p>

<p>We're not the only people to make the comparison either; "It's not an Xbox, it's not a GameCube" Game File's Stephen Totilo posted on Bluesky shortly after the Machine's reveal. The Verge's Tom Warren opted to give it the cheeky nickname the "<a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1988671431211905535">GabeCube</a>".</p>
<p>Still, it <em>is</em> missing a handle, but it does have a customisable face plate. Not quite the same as the little GameCube logo on top of the console, but similar enough. It's sleek, small, and we're a little envious.</p>

<p>Our friends over at Digital Foundry have <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/hands-on-with-steam-machine-valves-new-pcconsole-hybrid">an excellent run-down of the new console</a> (alongside the other two peripherals) if you want more details.</p>
<p>Prices will be revealed at a later date, but the console is due to arrive in early 2026. Oh, but if Valve doesn't release a handle within a few months of the Steam Machine's release, well, they've missed a trick, we reckon.</p>
<p>But it's good to see the old cubic design back in full force. The GameCube <em>truly</em> is perfect, design wise, isn't it?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, has commented on Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine. Furthermore, it seems he’s on board with the idea, given Microsoft is a top seller there.</p>







<p>Just announced, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> is Valve’s answer to the console market. With the device, you can bring your entire Steam library to your TV, complete with a controller. The news has received a lot of positive feedback, particularly from Steam fans, who can now play on the big screen without hassle. With a new console on the market, one would think it would be cause for competition. However, in Xbox’s case, it seems like it’s more welcoming than threatening, at least for Phil Spencer.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-ceo-welcomes-steam-machine-congratulates-valve-on-the-announcement">Xbox CEO Welcomes Steam Machine, Congratulates Valve on the Announcement</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988674569717313578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet on X/Twitter</a>, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer commented on the announcement of the Steam Machine. His comment can be found below:</p>



<p>“<strong>Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms</strong>,” Phil Spencer <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988674569717313578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a>. “<strong>Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox’s vision from the start. As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere. Congrats on today’s launch.</strong>”</p>



<p>Phil mentions that Xbox games are a high seller on Steam, which is partially true. Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-300-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Diablo 3 all rank among the best-selling titles on the platform. Seeing as Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-addresses-rumors-surrounding-xbox-console-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning another console</a> and its shift away from exclusivity, perhaps the next console could be similar to the Steam Machine. If so, it might be best for Xbox to keep a close eye on Valve’s new console. Either way, it is nice to see some camaraderie in the industry, especially with Valve being quite a threat to Xbox with the console now.</p>







<p>What do you think of Phil Spencer’s comments on the Steam Machine? Think Xbox will be doing a similar console? Will you be buying a Steam Machine in 2026?

Bargain. A cheeky 512GB of extra storage for $10 and change off? Believe it.

They're lighter, more compact, and usually less expensive. Electric assisted scooters give you more range and speed for less effort, and the brushless motor is pretty quiet. You'd think upgrading to one would cost you a lot of money, but that doesn't have to be the case. AliExpress is offering a couple of well-regarded electric scooters at prices you probably didn't expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can pick up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxqBp?object_uuid=eeaeeb8c-4c25-4e72-993c-aba4f092166f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LADPED LP80</a> 350W electric scooter for just $127 with coupon code "<strong>AEUS26</strong>".

Both scooters ship free from a local US warehouse; since they've already been shipped from overseas, any tariffs have already been paid for and you don't need to worry about them. AliExpress marketplace vendor AOVOPRO is an authorized reseller of these scooters and has plenty of reviews and sales to back up its reputation.</p></div><p id="60-off-samsung-s90d-65"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="60% off Samsung S90D 65" and="">60% off Samsung S90D 65" and 77"</h2></p><div><div id="230277" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>65" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><div id="230278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>77" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">144hz refresh rate screams gaming TV to me, especially when it's on a quantum dot OLED screen.

AMD is slowly clawing back its GPU market share by targeting mid-range gamers, but the RX 9070 XT is a brilliant graphics card. Whilst I can run something like Oblivion Remastered at 4K 60FPS all day long on it, I get a lot more joy from it playing at 1440P and getting twice the frame rate instead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> is set to receive what could be its biggest update yet, including reverted aim assist and additional weapon bloom tweaks, as soon as November 18, as work on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-revealed-heres-what-to-expect"><u>Season 1</u></a> continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios outlined the past, present, and future of its Battlefield 6 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec">REDSEC</a> post-launch plans in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/updates-ahead-of-california-resistance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an update posted online</u></a> today. It comes with a list of headlines for ongoing issues players can expect to see addressed when Season 1’s next chapter, California Resistance, launches November 18, as well as some of the content set to arrive with Winter Offensive come December 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For our teams across Battlefield Studios, this is just the start,” a message from the team says. “We’ve been watching, reading, listening, and we’re hard at work on how we will evolve the experiences for you all. We’re focused, fired up, and getting it done because Battlefield has always been at its best when we build it together, as we have done on our journey through Battlefield Labs, our Open Beta, launch and the current Season 1.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios has teased that the Battlefield 6 California Offensive update will bring a new map, called Eastwood, alongside new weapons and a new mode. We now know the mid-season update will also tackle five key elements across the experience: Weapon dispersion/bloom, lighting adjustments, challenge clarity, Fort Lyndon in Portal, and aim assist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weapon dispersion and weapon bloom remain one of the hottest topics among Battlefield 6 players online, as they affect each weapon’s accuracy depending on a variety of in-game factors. BF Studios says it’s made a “small tuning pass that reduces how quickly dispersion and recoil build up during sustained fire.” These tweaks apply to all weapons, with most also benefiting from recoil refinements, with the developers hoping players’ weapons “feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges” going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lighting and visibility changes target soldier visibility, while challenge requirements, something BF Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-major-overhaul-of-challenges-and-assignments-with-significant-reductions-to-challenge-requirements-available-now">already began tackling in a recent update</a>, should be clearer starting with the November 18 update for Battlefield 6. Portal players can also expect to take advantage of more from Fort Lyndon as they continue building out their ideal Battlefield 6 maps and modes. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-to-revert-aim-assist-settings-as-pc-players-edit-files-to-turn-off-crossplay">promised</a>, aim assist settings will also be reverted to fall more in line with what players experienced during the open beta tests a few months back.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve adjusted Aim Assist to make aiming feel smoother and more predictable, helping players build stronger muscle memory,” a message from the team says. “Tuning is now similar to the Open Beta experience. As a result, Infantry Aim Assist and Infantry Aim Assist Slowdown have been reset to match the new values, so try the update before making changes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is set to receive major changes when California Resistance launches November 18, but the December 9 update could also deliver some game-changing adjustments. Vehicle balance tweaks are one thing BF Studios has planned for next month, with fixes for some Breakthrough and Rush maps also on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, while no concrete plans are in the pipeline yet, BF Studios has outlined a number of community talking points that it is looking into for Battlefield 6 and REDSEC. These include additional challenge adjustments, UI and menu improvements, player stats, social play, hit registration/netcode, the overall vehicle experience, and, yes, even map sizes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen your comments about map size and pacing. Battlefield is at its best when maps offer different ways to play and constant action around every corner. Striking that balance is always a priority, and we are committed to a variety of map types across future Seasons. With Eastwood arriving in the California Resistance Update, we will continue monitoring existing maps and modes for targeted adjustments (like what’s planned in <em>Winter Offensive</em>) while also learning from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-brilliant-battlefield-6-players-flock-to-giant-fan-made-conquest-maps-as-map-size-debate-rages-on">community creations in Portal</a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal players have famously used the community tools it offers to build not only wacky creations but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">some of the bigger maps players are looking for</a>, too. IGN recently spoke with creative director Thomas Andersson about the future of Portal, and we learned that BF Studios has more in store when it comes to fleshing out that mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s always been the plan to add features and add new content as we go to Portal and make that available for people to create new, impressive experiences,” Andersson said. “The stuff they’ve created so far is just mind-blowing, some of it. It’s like, ‘Oh, how do you guys think of this?’ It’s crazy.

Players will, however, be able to buy a home, decorate it, design rooms, join Neighborhoods, earn decor through achievements, and craft decor items.

That includes a prologue questline to set up the story of Midnight, a new Lorewalking campaign centered around the origins of the Blood and Void Elves of Azeroth, and a quest chain to unlock Pandaren Heritage armor. The Timewalking event Turbulent Timeways will also make a return, and will for the first time feature dungeons from 2020's Shadowlands expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Another major addition coming in The War Within's final patch is a revamped new- and returning-player experience. New players will journey from the Exile's Reach tutorial zone straight into the Dragonflight expansion. Returning players will be able to travel to a new experience that sees them team up with Thrall and Jaina, after which they'll be equipped in level-appropriate gear and able to jump into the rest of the game as they see fit. A "recap" version of The War Within will additionally be available to new or returning players who wish to play through an accelerated version of the expansion to get caught up with the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">The arrival of housing is a major moment for Blizzard's MMORPG, though some players do have concerns with how Blizzard is looking to monetize the highly anticipated feature. Last week, Blizzard revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-new-premium-currency-is-player-friendly-and-more-efficient-blizzard-says/1100-6536042/" data-ref-id="1100-6536042">premium currency called Hearthsteel</a> that will be used to purchase housing items on the game's shop, sparking swift outcry from concerned players. Blizzard said the introduction of Hearthsteel is intended to be player-friendly and more convenient for making smaller purchases.</p>

Hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat was asked in an interview about what Valve's position is, at a high level, regarding pricing, and Aldehayyat said the aim is to land at a "competitive price" that matches up with the value provided. This is what most companies say about their new products, and Valve is following suit. The aim, he said, is to make it "affordable."</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>Aldehayyat said affordability is a key concern for many today, maybe more than ever, as <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inflation ticks up</a> and concerns remain ongoing due to the impact of tariffs.</p><p>"The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it's just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible," Aldehayyat added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's a lot of nebulous talk, but it's as much as Valve was willing to say at this juncture. The system is set to be released in Spring 2026, with preorders presumably opening beforehand.</p><p>Valve also did not disclose the prices for the new Steam Controller and Steam Frame virtual reality headset.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new Fellowship patch is being released on November 13th, bringing more changes to the game. Those changes include removing the Haunting of Stronghold event, adjusting character stats with some attacks getting major buffs, and adjusting armour values for cloth and leather armour. You can check out the full patch notes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fellowship | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCJPI8DIDQ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<ul>
<li>Removed the ‘Haunting of Stronghold’ Event.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated the Stronghold’s appearance.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated the Stronghold music, emitters, and ambience.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated Stronghold Loading Screen.<wbr></li>
<li>Removed the ‘Caretaker of Fallen Heroes’<wbr></li>
<li>Added the ability to bind Left and Right mouse buttons but only when used with modifiers.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where middle-mouse clicks weren’t registering when clicking on health bars.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where non-party leaders were still getting AFK kicked while matchmaking.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the ‘select previous target’ functionality where the history could be lost.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed various translation issues in text throughout the game.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added feedback so health bars on the party frame will now fade down when the other player is out of range, or line of sight to them is blocked. The distance check is based on the standard max range of ranged hero abilities.<wbr></li>
<li>Added a ‘Refresh Regions’ button to the start menu to force the refresh of each region’s state. Previously players needed to restart the client.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cloth &amp; Leather Armor Adjustments</b>&nbsp;We have increased the amount of armor provided by Cloth and Leather items. Our intention is to have a noticeable difference in between the Armor Classes in the game – and to overtime supply players with a variation of ways to deal with encounters where Physical damage specifically becomes a problem for them as we continue expanding on the game’s systems. However, we have noticed that the difference was larger than intended on higher difficulties and decided to increase the amount of armor found on Cloth and Leather items to reduce that gap. This will affect all cloaks and Rime and Ardeos (cloth) – and Sylvie, Mara, Elarion, and Meiko (leather).<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>At 330 item level, Cloth heroes will now have around 25% physical damage reduction from their armor (was 14.5%).<wbr></li>
<li>At 330 item level, Leather heroes will now have around 32% physical damage reduction from their armor (was 22%).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Armor Adjustments and Meiko</b>&nbsp;Adjusting for the changes to Leather armor values, we have adjusted Meiko’s kit in some places to make sure her defensive power does not increase while she has all her buffs and effects active. The change will increase Meiko’s defensive power when she has no buffs or effects active.<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>[Stone Shield] now increases Meiko’s Armor by 20% (was 50%) per stone up to a maximum of 60% at 3 stones (was 150% at 3 stones).<wbr></li>
<li>[Spirited Armor] (spirit refund passive) now increases Meiko’s Armor by 20% (was 30%).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify how the above changes affect Meiko’s defensive power in various situations (using 330 item level without gems as the reference point):<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>With no buffs or effects, Meiko now has 48.95% Physical DR (was 41.04%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges, Meiko now has 68,17% Physical DR (was 66,95%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges + [Spirited Armor] proc Meiko now has 70.88% Physical DR (was 70.82%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges + [Resonance] from talent + [Serenity] DR from legendary boots Meiko now has 83.45% Physical DR (was 82.23%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges + [Resonance] from talent + [Serenity] DR from legendary boots + [Spirited Armor] proc Meiko has 84.86% Physical DR (was 84.32%).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ardeos</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>The direct damage dealt while channeling [Incinerate] has been increased by 312%.<wbr></li>
<li>The damage over time of [Incinerate] now deals 62.5% increased damage.<wbr></li>
<li>The damage over time of [Incinerate] now gains +30% increased damage for each stack applied.<wbr></li>
<li>[Incinerate] now has a static channel time of 2.5 seconds, and its tick rate is now affected by your Haste.<wbr></li>
<li>[Incinerate] no longer generates Cinders.<wbr></li>
<li><u>Note: Ardeos Spirit Ability, Incinerate, was underperforming and did not have enough of an impact beyond its ability to generate Cinders and extend the duration of his other damage over time effects. In addition to this, Ardeos’; ramp time has been a bit too long – especially in the early game. As such, the ability no longer generates cinders and deals heavy damage on its own, to allow Ardeos players to get into their big burst moment earlier.</u><wbr></li>
<li>The initial direct damage of [Apocalypse] has been increased by 50%.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tariq</b><wbr></p>

<li>Skull Crusher damage increased by 10%.<wbr></li>
<li>Culling Strike damage increased by 54%.<wbr></li>
<li>The additional Lightning Damage dealt by Heavy Strike, Skull Crusher, and Hammer Storm during Thunder Call was reduced to 30% of the initial hit (was 50%).<wbr></li>
<li>Schism talent now has 3.2 PPM (was 1.2 PPM) and the damage bonus has been reduced to +200% (was +300%).<wbr></li>
<li>Bloodied Brass necklace (legendary necklace) now deals 350% of Face Breaker’s damage to the target of 24 seconds (was 450%).<wbr></li>
<li><u>Note: The lightning damage in Tariq’s kit has been reduced, while the power of his other abilities have been increased. Overall, his total damage should be at a similar place as before, but more of the damage is coming from your non-lightning mechanics – with the intention of making other legendaries and talents more competitive.</u><wbr></li>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-november-grand-theft-auto-v-pacific-drive-still-wakes-the-deep-and-more/">announced the full lineup of games</a> joining the PS Plus Extra Games Catalog for November 2025, and the big headlining title is one that we already expected, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-reportedly-heading-back-to-ps-plus-extra-catalog/">thanks to a leak from last week</a>. As expected, Grand Theft Auto V is indeed making a return to the library of PS Plus Extra titles, and it's doing so alongside BAFTA-winning games like Still Wakes the Deep and Thank Goodness You're Here. </p>



<p>There are eight titles joining the library of PS Plus Extra games, and one game entering the library of PS Plus Premium Classic games. </p>



<p>Starting with the games entering the Extra tier library, while GTA V is the big headlining title that is also re-entering the service ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI launching next year in November 2026, it's not the only interesting title joining the library. Thank Goodness You're Here, for example, is arguably one of the funniest video games ever made and a BAFTA-winning title from 2024.</p>



<p>Pacific Drive is another notable title entering the service, as it excellently captures the Pacific Northwest in a mysterious journey where players build a strong bond with a mystical station wagon that you customize the more you explore. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> is another BAFTA-winning title from 2024 that's entering the library, and another game that's well worth checking out if you haven't already.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games entering the PS Plus Extra Games Library for November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Pacific Drive (PS5)</li>



<li>Thank Goodness You're Here (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Talos Principle 2 (PS5)</li>



<li>Insurgency Sandstorm (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Still Wakes the Deep (PS5)</li>



<li>Monster Jam Showdown (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>MotoGP 25 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>



<p>The lone game joining the PS Plus Premium Classics catalog this month is Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which will be playable on PS5 and PS4.</p>
