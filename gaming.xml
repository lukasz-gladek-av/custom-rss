            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/657294/wii-homebrew-channel-archived-stolen-nintendo-code<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The GitHub repository for The Homebrew Channel (HBC), a popular piece of software used on hacked Nintendo Wiis, has been archived. Its maintainers are accusing the creators of “libogc,” a software toolkit HBC relies on, of stealing both Nintendo-made and open-source code and presenting it as their own, according to a <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc?tab=readme-ov-file">ReadMe posted to the repository yesterday</a> by <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow">hacking group fail0verflow</a>. (Hat tip to <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946">X user OatmealDome</a>.)</p><p>HBC is a central piece of the Wii homebrew community, serving as a launcher for non-Nintendo-approved software without needing to re-run an exploit. Through it, you can do things like load GameCube and Wii game files, run older console emulators, and more from a USB-connected hard drive or the Wii’s SD card slot. HBC is also one of the cleanest ways to back up your own Wii or GameCube collection, as you can copy files from game discs using Nintendo’s own hardware.</p><p>In its ReadMe, fail0verflow, which owns the HBC repository, writes that although they knew early on that libogc used some stolen Nintendo code, they thought much of the rest of it was original code and decided to “reluctantly” continue using it. However, they say that after <a href="https://github.com/derek57/libogc">another developer</a> claimed the code was actually lifted from the open-source RTEMS without attribution, they filed an issue that libogc’s developers closed and replied to with “verbal abuse” to before deleting it. HBC’s developers say they now “consider it impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software at this point, and cannot encourage any further development.”</p><p>WiiHacks, one of the most well-made guides for hacking a Wii, still seems to offer all of the file downloads needed to hack a Wii. But as <a href="https://gamerant.com/wii-homebrew-copyright-infringement-stolen-nintendo-code-accusations/"><em>GameRant</em> notes</a>, that could change, particularly with the HBC developers admitting that some Nintendo code was used in the tooling it relies on. Nintendo has been known to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">go after emulation projects</a> in the past, after all. If you’ve already hacked a Wii, none of this will matter much. HBC itself hasn’t had any major updates for years — just don’t count on any persistent bugs going away anytime soon, if ever.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a weird way, the weekend box office shows that original movies can still succeed, while also showing just how powerful nostalgic comfort food can be in 2025.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197544,197541" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Last weekend, on April 18, director<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sinners-movie-trailer-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1851750191&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sinners-movie-trailer-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1851750191"> Ryan Coogler’s vampire film <em>Sinners</em></a></span> hit theaters to rave reviews and a huge box office return. In its first weekend in theaters, the R-rated original horror film brought in more than $55 million over Easter weekend. And that’s just in the United States. It was an impressive haul, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.salon.com/2025/04/26/the-smash-success-of-sinners-could-shift-hollywoods-power-balance/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.salon.com/2025/04/26/the-smash-success-of-sinners-could-shift-hollywoods-power-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even if some tried to downplay it</a></span>. <em>Sinners</em> cost around $90 million to make, not counting marketing, so some worried that the pricey horror film wouldn’t be able to break even or make a profit. But given its continued success, I think those concerns are gone now. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2153611265/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2153611265/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On April 28, <em>Box Office Mojo</em> reported</a></span> that during its second weekend in theaters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sinners-box-office-massive-second-weekend-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-rerelease-scores-1236379466/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sinners-box-office-massive-second-weekend-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-rerelease-scores-1236379466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sinners</em> earned $45 million</a></span>. That’s just a six percent drop from its opening weekend returns. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/smallest_second_weekend_gross_drop/?by_release_scale=super_saturated&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/smallest_second_weekend_gross_drop/?by_release_scale=super_saturated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That kind of small drop is really rare these days</a></span>, especially for a live-action original film. And it’s nearly unheard for horror movies, which tend to lose momentum after the first weekend. </p><p>In comparison, <em>Megan</em> in 2023—which was a very popular horror movie—dropped nearly 40 percent in its second weekend. 2018's massively popular <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1342342657/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1342342657/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Halloween</em> reboot/sequel dropped 58 percent</a></span> in its second weekend. So yeah, live-action horror hits rarely drop so little. It’s a good sign for WB and Coogler that <em>Sinners</em> will likely have some long legs going into May. Currently, the movie’s total worldwide box office score is $161 million. </p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> was re-released in theaters over the weekend and shocked everyone,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2905833473/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2905833473/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> earning an astounding $42 million globally</a></span>, with more than half that coming from the US alone. That’s wild for a movie that has been easily accessible via streaming for over a decade now. The 20-year-old <em>Star Wars</em> sequel was the second-biggest movie in the United States, behind <em>Sinners</em>, and just in front of Ben Affleck’s newly released <em>The Accountant 2</em>. </p><h2 id="h5097"><a id=""></a>Do people want new ideas or nostalgic rereleases? Yes</h2><p>Why I find this weekend’s box office results so weird is that you can easily use the same numbers to argue to very different ideas. </p><p>You can point to <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>’s big haul and suggest that audiences are less hungry for new movies than ever before, and are willing to pay theater ticket prices to watch something from 20 years ago. However, you could also point to <em>Sinners</em> having a record-breaking second weekend and suggest that audiences demand new ideas and movies. Honestly, I’d say that both takes are correct. I think people are more likely to watch comfort food over something new, but there is a demand for fresh movies from famous directors with proven track records. </p><p>I think people—as always—want good movies, or to have fun at the theater, or both. And it doesn’t matter if the film is old, new, unique, or a sequel. The secret really is: Make good movies people like. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">But then again, <em>Minecraft</em> crossed $800 million at the box office this weekend and that movie sucks</a></span>. </p><p>So actually, I have no idea what people want. Never mind. </p><p>&nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In December 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-remake-officially-in-development-at-ubisoft-toronto/1100-6499011/">Ubisoft revealed a Splinter Cell remake</a> starring Sam Fisher. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-splinter-cell-remake-details-shared/1100-6499038/">Ubisoft Toronto was tasked with reviving the franchise</a>, previously making Blacklist as well as 2021's Far Cry 6. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-celebrates-splinter-cell-20th-anniversary-shares-remake-concept-art/1100-6509255/">For the Splinter Cell 20th anniversary</a> in 2022, a few new details were shared for the Splinter Cell remake, such as concept art and new AI behaviors for enemies. However, since then, info has been relatively sparse. GameSpot's Gabe Gurwin <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-a-splinter-cell-devotee-wants-from-the-remake/1100-6499075/">shared a wish list of things for the Splinter Cell remake</a> as a huge fan of the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">At one point, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-four-games-including-splinter-cell-vr-and-ghost-recon-frontline/1100-6505722/" data-ref-id="1100-6505722">a Splinter Cell VR title in the works, but that got canned</a> in 2022. Later that year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-audio-series-premieres-today/1100-6509680/" data-ref-id="1100-6509680">a Splinter Cell audio series did come out</a> with eight episodes. Additionally, there's a Splinter Cell faction in the free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">XDefiant, but it's shutting down in June</a>. </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-movie-sneaks-back-to-the-shadows-after-being-canceled/1100-6527785/">A Splinter Cell movie was canceled</a> last year, which could have seen Venom's Tom Hardy wearing the goggles and becoming Sam Fisher. The stealth franchise will come to TV screens, though, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-debuts-trailers-for-splinter-cell-tomb-raider-dmc-and-more/1100-6526599/">an upcoming Netflix series called Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</a>. Liev Schrieber will voice Fisher instead of Michael Ironside.</p>

It also surprised other games released on the same day.</p><p dir="ltr">That's the case with developer Red Soul's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/post-trauma/" data-ref-id="5000-542161">Post Trauma</a>, an indie survival horror title inspired by early PlayStation classics like Silent Hill and Resident Evil that was also released on April 22. The game's publisher, Raw Fury, is now going with a "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" approach to the situation, announcing Post Trauma will jokingly be getting a "spiritual re-release" in the wake of Oblivion Remastered stealing its thunder.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/1915784451440681375" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on X</a>, Raw Fury said the game's re-release event will be called Post Trauma: The Re-Release Except We're Not Un-Releasing It First, And It's Pretty Much the Same, promoted by the hashtag "PleaseNoShadowDropThisTime." It will "re-release" on June 23, a "completely random number that we chose" that just so happens to coincide with how long it takes to finish Oblivion Remastered.</p><p dir="ltr">"There'll be giveaways, streams, and celebrations on this spiritual re-release day, so make sure you're there," a Raw Fury employee says in the video. "Once you've finished playing Oblivion, obviously."</p><p dir="ltr">Post Trauma sees players step into the shoes of Roman, a train conductor transported to a strange dimension following a panic attack. It is filled with Resident Evil-style puzzles, save rooms, and fixed camera angles, as players navigate its surreal world filled with nightmarish monsters and eerie environments. Post Trauma is available on Steam, as well as Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">Raw Fury isn't the only to be caught off guard by Oblivion Remastered's sudden release. Another indie game, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-case-you-missed-it-this-lovecraft-meets-battlestar-galactica-game-is-out-right-now/1100-6531120/" data-ref-id="1100-6531120">Lovecraft-inspired roguelike Starless Abyss, released on April 25</a> to little fanfare. Some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">worried Oblivion Remastered would overshadow a different day-one Game Pass RPG</a> released April 24, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, although those worries seem to have been overblown. One of the game's stars said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-best-reviewed-game-can-exist-alongside-oblivion-remastered-clair-obscur-star-says/1100-6531070/" data-ref-id="1100-6531070">both RPGs can exist alongside each other</a>, and Clair Obsur: Expedition 33 has gone on to sell more than one million copies in three days, with Bethesda announcing 4 million players had played Oblivion Remastered.</p>

			<p>Embark Studios, the studio behind the multiplayer shooter hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-announces-the-finals-season-5-coming-december-12/">The Finals,</a> is set to have a playtest for its next release, Arc Raiders, which is due out sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Beginning this coming Wednesday, April 30, Embark will host its second playtest for Arc Raiders. The first playtest for the game happened last October and was only open to PC players. This time, it'll be open to players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside PC players, and it will run from Wednesday to next Sunday, May 4.</p>
<p>Embark showed off a new trailer for Arc Raiders today, ahead of the playtest kicking off on Wednesday, showing a bit more gameplay, including some shots of players battling giant robots.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Tech Test 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTRRb7ODhjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arc Raiders is a third-person shooter, rather than another FPS, and is a PvPvE extraction shooter. Back in 2021, it was initially meant to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">debut game</a> for Embark Studios, before it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">delayed</a> several times, due in part to it changing from its original vision, since it wasn't always meant to be a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Even with the delays and changes to what the game was originally meant to be, Arc Raiders is shaping up to be a game to watch out for. Embark Studios has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it can make a game with legs, even in an overcrowded shooter space, with its success with The Finals.</p>
<p>There's no reason to think it couldn't do the same with Arc Raiders, even after what many would consider to be signs of the game having a troubled development. If you're keen on checking out Arc Raiders, there's still time to sign up and potentially be selected for Wednesday's playtest through the game's <a href="https://arcraiders.com/">official website</a>.</p>

            <p>
Top executives behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> have been accused of extremist actitivites by Russian authorities over their support of Ukraine, Russian state media has reported.
</p>
<p>
The owner of World of Tanks maker Wargaming and the boss of the game's separate Russian operator Lesta Games stand to have their stake in their respective companies seized by the Russian government as a result.
</p>
<p>
Development on World of Tanks, as well as its various spin-offs, was split in two following Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It was at this time that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-tanks-developer-wargaming-leaves-russia-and-belarus">Wargaming publicly stated it had pulled out of Russia</a>, with its offices in Minsk, Moscow and St Petersburg continuing on separately under the Lesta Games banner.
</p>
<p>
Now, two World of Tanks develerops (and two versions of each game) exist - though the Russian government does not appear to be making a distinction between them.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, <a href="https://ria.ru/20250426/genprokuratura-2013563207.html">Russian news agency RIA.ru</a>, which is owned by the Russian state, reports that the country's prosecutor general wants to seize the shares held by Lesta owner Malik Khatazhaev, as well as those of Wargaming owner Viktor Kisly.
</p>
<p>
Evidence for this action appears to be Wargaming's subsequent support for Ukraine, including an in-game campaign designed to raise funds for ambulances. This campaign was nothing to do with Lesta Games, but is being used as evidence the lucrative company does not support Russia's "special operation" in order to potentially seize its funds.
</p>
<p>
"The company operates in full compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, so we have no reason to have any concerns or conceal information," a message posted to Telegram from Lesta Games stated, as reported by Russian news website <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/04/2025/680a30609a794772af778315">RBC</a>. "We have not violated anything and we have nothing to fear."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Wargaming for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that global sales of its most acclaimed game, Elden Ring, have topped 30 million units. The news comes three years and a couple of months after the February 2022 launch of the open world RPG, which later won many Game of the Year awards (<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-22-best-games-of-2022-and-most-anticipated-of-2023-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including ours</a>). Elden Ring also received a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from reviewer Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>I tried hard to find any faults in Elden Ring, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find any outside of some technical issues that the developers could fix via patches. I firmly believe that perfection doesn't exist and that it is always possible to improve, but I really couldn't think of anything that Elden Ring could have done better. As such, the game wholly deserves a perfect score, an honor I would have given only to a couple of other modern games, not only for its extremely high quality but also for what it accomplished with its open world and for how it will surely influence video games as a whole in the future.</em></p>
<p>The combination of the perfected Soulslike formula in an open world and the worldbuilding by G. R. R. Martin enthralled millions of fans, who finally got more content last year with the release of the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a>. FromSoftware hasn't provided updated sales figures for the DLC, but we know from a previous report that Shadow of the Erdtree had sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five million copies in just the first three days on the market</a>. At this rate, it's likely to be approaching ten million, for a potential attach rate of one-third.</p>
<p>More Elden Ring is coming soon to fans, albeit with a wholly different flavor. The cooperative multiplayer spin-off Nightreign is set to launch in about a month, and the developers have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the official PC system requirements. Meanwhile, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hands-on preview from the recent beta test</a>.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a brand-new IP called The Duskbloods, which will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. They later clarified to worried fans that Nightreign and The Duskbloods (which also features multiplayer) <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are not a hint at the studio's desire to abandon single player games</a>.</p>

                <p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> launching day on on Game Pass recently, some wondered if the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">1 million sales figure</a> could have been even higher had it not launched into the subscription service. This is not a new debate, as people have been discussing the economical merits of Game Pass for years, but Expedition 33 (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">and Oblivion Remastered</a>) coming to Game Pass recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">reignited the chatter.</a></p><p>Palworld communications and publishing boss John "Bucky" Buckley <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1916636430992052706" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">weighed in on social media</a>, writing that Expedition 33 is just the latest game to be "unwittingly dragged" through online discussions about Game Pass. Buckley said he has more knowledge than most on this topic given Palworld launched day one into Game Pass back in 2024 to great success.</p><p>"I'll just say yes, yes it is very worth having your game on Game Pass," he said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1916710392778350762" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up post</a>, the developer reminded people that he's speaking from the perspective of an independent game developer, so his comments should be understand from that context. Buckley said he has no experience in the AAA space and can't speak to "what sort of deals are cooked up there."</p><p>But Buckley said Palworld developer Pocketpair has brought two games already to Game Pass--Palworld and Craftopia--and the studio is "very happy with both."</p><h2><strong>"Subscriptions are certainly not THE future of gaming"</strong></h2><p>Much of the discussion around Game Pass has centered on whether or not a subscription service like Game Pass could take over and become the dominant form of game consumption in the future. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said he doesn't see that happening, at least not soon.</p><p>He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnsxkebdjk24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that spending on video game subscription services in the US experienced growth in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID and a little more at the end of 2024 thanks to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass. But in general, spending on subscription services has been "basically flat" lately.</p><p>As such, Piscatella said, "Subscriptions are certainly not THE future of gaming (although they can continue to be part of it)."</p><p>Not everyone is as optimistic about Game Pass as Buckley from Pocketpair when it comes to launching games into the service. Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said this kind of strategy for big new releases has never made sense, and instead represents a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">"lost opportunity" for a game sale.</a></p><p>Take-Two might consider bringing older titles to Game Pass, like Take-Two recently did by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-and-enhanced-version-out-now-on-game-pass/1100-6530881/" data-ref-id="1100-6530881">bringing GTA 5 back to Game Pass</a>, but for new releases, it doesn't make business sense for Take-Two, Zelnick said. Take-Two has one of the most highly anticipated games of all time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, coming up soon, and no one should expect it to come to Game Pass at launch or soon thereafter. Experts believe the game could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and drive $3 billion in revenue in its first year alone</a>, so it's not hard to understand why Take-Two wouldn't want to put the game into a subscription service out of the gate, or ever.</p><p>Every company operates differently and has different goals in mind, and Take-Two's business approach doesn't have to line up with what other companies are doing.</p><p>For example, Rebellion just recently launched Atomfall into Game Pass on day one, and it led to Atomfall experiencing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-release-atomfall-is-devs-most-successful-game-in-32-years/1100-6530519/" data-ref-id="1100-6530519">biggest debut for any game in Rebellion's 32-year history. </a> A key thing to know here, however, is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">Microsoft paid Rebellion for this</a>, thus mitigating some of the cannibalization risk. Rebellion's own CEO said the company might have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">lost out on game sales by launching into Game Pass</a>, but on balance, it was the right thing for his company in this particular situation.</p><p>Even Microsoft itself has admitted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/" data-ref-id="1100-6511473">games that launch into Game Pass are known to experience decreased game sales.</a></p><p>This discussion and debate is not going to be resolved soon, or ever. Game Pass represents <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/" data-ref-id="1100-6498307">a paradigm shift in the gaming landscape</a>, and was always going to elicit passionate responses from fans and pundits.</p>

			<p>Like many other creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-is-working-on-a-game-that-might-or-might-not-be-nier/">Yoko Taro</a>, creator and director of Nier Automata,&nbsp;fears that generative AI technology will advance to the point where it could replace game creators.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366">Famitsu</a>, Taro admitted his fears that game developers and creators could find themselves out of work in the next five decades, with how generative AI technology is evolving.</p>
<p>While speaking to Yoko Taro, Kotaro Uchikoshi, and Jiro Ishii, the topic of generative AI came up regarding how it could influence the video game industry and what its impact will be on creative industry's overall.</p>
<p>Uchikoshi began saying, "There are<em>&nbsp;a lot of new games I want to create, but with AI technology evolving at such a high speed, I fear that there is a possibility that AI-generated adventure games will become mainstream</em>."</p>
<p>Taro added, "<em>I, too, believe that game creators may lose their jobs because of AI. There's a chance that in 50 years, game creators will be treated like bards...I think that in the future, we will move from an era where we have to imitate the style of our favorite creators to an era where we can have our favorite scenarios generated.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>AI will determine the preferences of users and skillfully generate route branchings that they would want to read, and the recommendation capabilities will continue to improve</em>."</p>
<p>It's understandable that Taro would have these fears, as it is for any creative to share these concerns, though it's not an inevitable fate. Generative AI may be constantly improving, but it's still a pipe dream to imagine that it would, in any genuine way, replace the best artists of our time. For video games, Yoko Taro is one of the best artists in the industry.</p>
<p>He'll still be regarded as such 50 years from now, and there will be a whole new crop of creators pushing the industry forward. Generative AI technology can and will improve as much as possible. Still, it won't ever be able to create anything new in the same way artists like Yoko Taro can.</p>

            <p>
Great news, fans of suffering in company. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>’s PC system requirements are upon us. If you have at least 30 GB of storage, 12 GB of RAM, a processor or graphics card from approximately this decade, and some willing or easily subjugated friends to serve as co-op partners, then you <em>too</em> will be able to savour the experience of getting your arse chewed off by a three-faced wolf made of swords and fireballs. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Those minimum specs, without further ado:
</p>
<blockquote><p>

Operating System - Windows 10
</p>
<p>
Processor - Intel Core 15-10600 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500
</p>
<p>
Memory - 12GB RAM
</p>
<p>
Graphics - Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3 GB or AMD Radeon RX 580 4 GB
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And here are some recommended PC specs, for you cosmopolitan elites who don’t enjoy getting your arse chewed off unless you can see all of your arse textures in pristine detail, with minimal lag. Goodness knows I need a steady frame rate when the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> Centipede Demon is eating my head. Could be a steady frame rate will even help you defeat that Centipede Demon, but come now, don’t be ridiculous. This is a From Software game. Nobody’s ever defeated a From Software boss. No, don't refer me to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> guides section - it's a house of lies. The point of From Software games is to perish in despair. And leave messages describing random objects as dogs.
</p>
<p>
Those recommended specs, anyway:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Operating System - Windows 11
</p>
<p>
Processor - Intel Core 15-11500 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600
</p>
<p>
Memory - 16GB RAM
</p>
<p>
Graphics - Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB or AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 8 GB
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You might be wondering why there are Dark Souls bosses in Nightreign. The answer is that Nightreign is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-to-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-in-yet-more-evidence-that-its-a-from-extended-universe-game">sort of Elden Ring: Across The Fromverse</a>, with creatures and characters from several previous games. It’s out on 30th May, and will probably be solid work. Personally, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">I dislike the idea of From making multiplayer a boxfront feature</a>, but I'm consoled by Hidetaka Miyazaki recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-arent-abandoning-single-player-in-favour-of-games-like-elden-ring-nightreign-says-miyazaki">swearing on his mum</a> that the developers will carry on making singleplayer games.

Despite middling ratings and reception when it originally aired in Japan, the anime found new life in North America several years later thanks to its after-school time slot. The show, with its dramatic mech-on-mech action and even more dramatic sci-fi melodrama, almost single-handedly established a foothold for the entire Gundam universe in the West. In the process, it created an entirely new generation of Gundam fans eager for more, helping to bring more Gundam shows overseas and creating a new market for the franchise's popular Gunpla plastic model kits.</p>

Mercy takes on the starring role as Gundam Wing Zero, while Soldier: 76 transforms into the iconic Tallgeese piloted in the show by the masked Zechs Merquise. Ramattra, meanwhile, transforms into the fearsome Gundam Epyon. And, of course, Overwatch's designated edgelord himself, Reaper, adopts the mantle of none other than Gundam Deathscythe.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot had the chance to talk with Overwatch 2 art director Dion Rogers and associate director of product management Aimee Dennett on how the crossover came to be, what it was like to work with Bandai, other Gundam Wing characters didn't make the cut, and the role Gunpla model kits played in both the selection of which Mobile Suits to feature and in the actual look of the skins themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it has long wanted to collaborate with Gundam, as it's one of the most-requested IPs among the staff. When it reached out to IP-holder Bandai about a potential crossover, the pieces began to fall into place for Gundam Wing's 30th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">Among the first decisions Blizzard had to make was which version of the Gundam Wing's various Mobile Suit designs it wanted to use: those from the show, or ones from its sequel movie, Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. Blizzard opted for the latter, though it wasn't an easy decision.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was a big debate around do we use the Gundam Wing show designs, or do we use the Endless Waltz film designs?" Dennett said. "So that kind of doubled the amount of possibilities. We did a lot of the characters in both the film design and the show design. We wanted to pick one or the other. We didn't want to do a mix, so we ended up liking the collection of the film."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483286" data-ratio="0.56256684491979" data-width="1870" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483286"></a><figcaption>Some pairings, like Gundam Deathscythe and Reaper, were an obvious choice.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When deciding on which Overwatch characters would get skins, Rogers said it came down to a number of factors. First and foremost, the team narrowed down which characters would seem like a strong fit or ones who would seem odd not to include. The team then looked at factors like whether or not a particular character hadn't received a skin in a while or which ones might surprise players to use. Some combinations were obvious for thematic reasons, like Reaper and Deathscythe, or for visual reasons, like Wing Zero and Mercy due to them both having wings.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Blizzard eventually landed on the four Mobile Suits and Overwatch heroes mentioned above for the collaboration, there were others that didn't make the cut. Rogers said he really wanted to make something work for D.Va due to her already being a mech pilot and the opportunity to have her cosplay as one of the show's human characters, but that Blizzard couldn't quite make it work.</p><p dir="ltr">Ana, for example, was originally proposed for Tallgeese but didn't come together. Gundam Heavyarms, a fan-favorite featured prominently in the show, was a shoe-in for the gatling-gun wielding Mauga that also didn't pan out in the end, with Zarya being another potential candidate. Dennett said Mauga's Heavyarms weapon looked "unbelievable," but that overall, the skin just didn't look right on the character.</p><p dir="ltr">"For Heavyarms, he was actually in the lineup," Dennett said. "We tried him on Mauga just because their weaponry is so similar. It's funny, you always have in your head, 'Oh, these are obvious combinations,' but once you see it on paper, it's not. Some don't look as great and some look absolutely amazing. We never planned Tallgeese on Soldier: 76, but once we saw the design, it was the opposite of Mauga Heavyarms. We were like, 'Oh, that looks so cool.'"</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483338,1300-4483337,1300-4483330,1300-4483329" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deciding which Mobile Suits to ultimately feature as part of the collab was its own process, one Blizzard said was informed not only by fans of Gundam Wing on the Overwatch team but with help from Bandai. The company also collaborated with Blizzard on how each character should look.</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers said Overwatch crossover skins always take the approach of the game's heroes "cosplaying" as their favorite characters. Blizzard initially worked hard on making each skin appear more Gundam and less Overwatch due to player feedback from previous collabs, while still trying to maintain each hero's unique and recognizable silhouette. Bandai came back to Blizzard and instead wanted to see more of each Overwatch hero, like Ramattra, in the designs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bandai felt like they didn't want us just slapping Gundam Wing on top of Overwatch," Rogers said. "They wanted to really feel super collaborative and they really leaned in on that idea that our characters are still there, but their IP."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483328" data-ratio="0.56273358248799" data-width="1873" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483328"></a><figcaption>Ramattra as the popular Gundam Epyon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bandai also had cold, hard data to help inform which Mobile Suits might be best to include for the collab--specifically, data related to Gunpla model kit sales. A Bandai artist who does artwork for Gunpla kits even contributed the collab's in-game lobby artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">"They didn't mandate we do anything," Dennett said. "It was all suggestions, but they did share a ranking of Gunpla sales and that did factor into the equation…That's not to say Gunpla sales were the factor, but it definitely helped us inform which were a pretty obvious choice and which ones weren't."</p><p dir="ltr">Gunpla played a role in the creation of the actual skins, too. Rogers said the team examined the actual Gunpla models for each Mobile Suit and looked to mimic their internal structure in their respective skin.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the actual models in-game, we tried to match pretty closely the skeletal work, within reason, the internal structure of the Gunpla, onto the actual hero," Rogers said. "Obviously they're human, so you can do only so much, but it's pretty authentic."</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2's Gundam Wing collab goes live April 29, with its four Mobile Suit-inspired skins joining the in-game shop alongside free Gundam-themed challenge rewards, including unique Pachimari weapon charm. Bundles for each skin (and corresponding items like sprays and Play of the Game animations) will cost 2,800 Overwatch Coins, with a mega bundle containing everything going for 5,900 coins.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Meta is laying off over 100 employees from its Reality Labs division, which focuses on VR, AR, and wearable hardware, an unnamed source recently revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The layoff has primarily impacted Reality Labs employees who were working on VR software for the company's line of Meta Quest headsets, along with employees who were focused on hardware, (including VR headsets), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true" rel="nofollow ">the source shared with Bloomberg</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the source--who asked not to be named due to the fact that they were sharing details that had not yet been made available to the public--Meta's goal is to combine and streamline tasks being worked on by the two teams within Reality Labs. In June 2024, it was reported that <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-reality-check-inside-the-45-billion-cash-burn-at-reality-labs-125717347.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Labs had lost nearly $50 billion</a> over the course of the previous four years.</p><p dir="ltr">Meta has confirmed that layoffs have taken place, but refused to elaborate or provide details on exactly how many employees had been affected.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size," Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said when asked to comment on the layoffs. "These changes are meant to help studios work more efficiently on future mixed-reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the content Meta has evidently deemed as expendable includes <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/supernatural/?srsltid=AfmBOop7SLuRXUollXinrhtzlvqbhia_JeGP90rgo-2m0Nn3XnzqZYYn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supernatural</a>, a VR-based fitness app that gives users access to training content from various fitness coaches and personal trainers, including a stretching program led by Jane Fonda and a "Boxing With Bon Jovi" workout. Supernatural was initially created by Within Unlimited (formerly Vrse), which Meta attempted to acquire in 2021. After a drawn-out fight with the FTC, Meta ultimately won its case and acquired Within (and its products, including Supernatural) in February 2023 for a grand total of $400 million. </p><p dir="ltr">Now, just over two years after the acquisition, Supernatural's future is up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're deeply saddened to share that these changes have resulted in the loss of some of our incredibly talented team members," Supernatural <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/getsupernatural/permalink/9571469649572696/">said on Facebook</a> last week, adding that the number of workout releases each week would be reduced going forward as a result of the layoffs.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Meta, Clayton claims that the company is "committed to investing in mixed-reality experiences including fitness and games."</p><p dir="ltr">"Our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged," Clayton said.</p><p>The Reality Labs layoffs are far from the first to hit Meta's workforce. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-lays-off-11000-workers-after-stock-slides-nearly-20/1100-6509047/">laid off 13% of its staff</a> (roughly 11,000 employees) back in 2022, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/meta-is-planning-to-cut-5-of-lowest-performers-memo-shows" rel="nofollow ">laid off another 5%</a> (~3,600 employees) earlier this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from Korean outlet <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/new-korean-starcraft-rights-ip-nc-soft">VG247</a>) marks the end of a rights battle between Nexon and Blizzard, seemingly resulting in Nexon, not Blizzard, leading development on the next major entry in the StarCraft series.</p>
<p>Blizzard will be working alongside Nexon to create this new StarCraft game, which could potentially be something besides a new RTS game, if Nexon really wanted to shake things up, that is. RTS games are incredibly popular in Korea, as is the StarCraft series. Moving away from the genre is a huge gamble, since the players who are looking for something to follow up 2013's Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm are probably looking for another RTS game, not a different game set in the StarCraft world.</p>
<p>Nexon didn't just win the ability to make a new StarCraft game in its rights battle though, it also won the opportunity to make a mobile version of Overwatch for Japan and Korea, which has immense potential considering the popularity of mobile games in Asia.</p>
<p>In both cases, this amounts to a big loss for Blizzard, with Nexon now having the keys to what could be a very lucrative castle that Blizzard has arguably fumbled. Of course, we're still a while away from seeing if Nexon will be able to capitalize on its chance here properly, but the potential is still undeniable at this stage.</p>
<p>Especially if Nexon does come out with a StarCraft game that shows how Blizzard's behind in the genre. That both companies collaborated on the game won't matter to players if Nexon can demonstrate that it was their influence that helped make the next game a success, should it be a success, that is.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate for Blizzard that its track record of late has been other studios showing that they can take something Blizzard did and do it better. It arguably happened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/">Overwatch</a> and how hero shooters have evolved since then. Many would argue that's what <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile</a> has done with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, and Nexon coming in to do the same with StarCraft would be the next nail in the coffin.</p>
