			<p>We've brought in the new year, and we are now in 2025, where there are plenty of big-name titles that are set to release. There have already been a number of predictions, especially when it comes to the state of the video game industry, which has had a very volatile couple of years. Last year saw a devastating number of layoffs. However, according to Jason Schreier, things will be looking up in 2025 for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>2024 ended with a lot of announcements for 2025 and, of course, the long-awaited Game Awards. The event saw many new game announcements, including the surprise announcement of<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"> Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. However, there have also been a ton of rumors about upcoming titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, a game that is eagerly awaited by fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-03/video-game-predictions-for-2025-from-grand-theft-auto-vi-to-silksong?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNTkyNzI4MiwiZXhwIjoxNzM2NTMyMDgyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUElZMDdUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.G8QUT2LbVY_4QAMSSgnnHB1OqBGcv939rI9lcczGAJU&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schreier predicts</a> that there will be major changes coming for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">Ubisoft</a>. Out of all of the predictions, this one would be the least surprising. Ubisoft has had an incredibly tumultuous couple of years, with both Star Wars Outlaws and XDefiant not performing how the company wanted. It is so much so that the servers for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">XDefiant are being shut down later this year</a>, with no new players being able to try out the game before it disappears.</p>
<p>According to the post by Schreier, Grand Theft Auto VI isn't going to perform as well as Rockstar Games may think. It is one of the most anticipated games of this year, as it's been a long time in the making, with many leaks coming out. However, being so highly anticipated puts a lot of pressure on Rockstar Games to perform, which could lead to negative consequences for the upcoming title.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been a long time coming, and as the months and years pass, it feels as if we hear even less about the game. So much so that people are beginning to wonder if it even exists at all. This game was first announced in 2019 after initially being slated to be a DLC. However, the scope increased massively and has now become a full title in development by Team Cherry. The last we heard was from <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoff Keighley in 2024</a> before Gamescom that there would be no announcements, as "Team Cherry is still cooking." The game was initially meant to be released in 2023, but they've said they are still developing it. Whether we'll actually see it released this year remains to be seen.</p>
<p>People are also hoping for a Half-Life announcement, as Half-Life: Alyx was released in 2020 but was only available to those who have VR. Last year saw a lot of rumors about Half-Life, and the possibility of the game making a resurgence with a new addition to the franchise. There is potential, but there's no certainty behind this rumor.</p>
<p>What are your video game predictions for 2025?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/marvel-rivals-lifts-100-year-cheating-bans-on-mac-and-steam-deck-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>With Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">impressive work on the Proton tool for Linux</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Mac's Game Porting Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/new-directx-12-to-metal-translation-could-bring-a-world-of-windows-games-to-macos/">CrossOver</a> options, few games are truly "Windows only" these days. The exceptions are those with aggressive, Windows-based anti-cheating tools baked in, something that hit back hard against players eager to dive into a new superhero shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, an <em>Overwatch</em>-ish free-to-play hero shooter released in early December 2024, has all the typical big online game elements: an in-game shop with skins and customizations, battle passes, and anti-cheating tech. While Proton, which powers the Linux-based Steam Deck's ability to play just about any Windows game, has come very far in a few years' time, its biggest blind spots are these kinds of online-only games, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/">like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/"><em>Fortnite</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">Apex Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the like. The same goes for Mac players, who, if they can work past DirectX 12, can often get a Windows game working in CrossOver or Parallels, minus any anti-cheat tools.</p>
<p>Is there harm in trying? For a while, there was 100 years' worth. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1hrsitf/marvel_rivals_banning_mac_os_users/">detailed in the r/macgaming subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">at r/SteamDeck</a>, many players who successfully got <em>Marvel Rivals</em> working would receive a "Penalty Issued" notice, with a violation "detected" and bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hs2s6z/ban_until_2124_for_cheating_but_i_didnt_cheat/">issued until 2124</a>. Should such a ban stand, players risked entirely missing the much-prophesied Year of the Linux Desktop or Mainstream Mac Gaming, almost certain to happen at some point in that span.</p>

                <p>It's a big day for Call of Duty, as the new Squid Game collaboration launches today, January 3, alongside a significant update across Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision has now posted the full patch notes, revealing all the significant changes and updates--and there are many.</p><p>Across Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone, all mantle speeds have been increased, while doors can now be opened and close while sprinting. Additionally, the Cleaver melee weapon is now available to unlock through the new Squid Game event reward in the new event pass, which costs 1,100 COD Points for the premium track.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja0LKjA4lxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ja0LKjA4lxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Activision warned that some players might see their Operator selections and customizations reset with the new update. Activision didn't say why this is occurring or what players can do about it beyond just starting over.</p><p>There are a bunch of new Squid Game-themed multiplayer modes available now in Black Ops 6, including Red Light, Green Light and one called Roulette Handgun. This mode allows players to obtain a powerful handgun that comes with the risk of killing the player, as each shot has a chance to blow up the weapon and the player.</p><p>There are no weapon-balance adjustments, but Black Ops 6's Scorestreaks are getting new tuning updates. This includes a reduction in max damage for the RC-XD and Care Packages now containing fewer Scout Pulses. The Sentry Turret, meanwhile, sees increases to its HP and fire rate, while the Watchdog Helo's damage is increased as well.</p><p>For Zombies, there is a new Squid Game mode called Dead Light, Green Light where players try to rack up zombie kills during the Green Light phase. When Red Light is called, any player who moves has essence drained from them. And when the Dead Light phase kicks in, players face off against increasingly difficult waves of zombies.</p><p>In Warzone, the January 3 patch fixes a number of bugs, including an error that would prevent the exfil animation to play during Ranked Play. The update also fixes an issue that incorrectly stopped players from using an Advanced UAV in some scenarios, and another issue pertaining to money drops.</p><p>The January 3 patch also brings a Squid Game mode to Warzone's Urzikstan map. This comes in the form of a rotating series of challenges, with teams eliminated each round until only one remains. Additionally, Red Light, Green Light can be triggered between rounds.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Activision.</a></p><p>As for Squid Game, the second season of the popular Netflix series is out now. Season 3 is set for release later this year.</p><h2>Friday, January 3, 2025</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Movement</h4><ul><li>Increased all mantle speeds.</li><li>Doors can now be opened and closed while sprinting.</li></ul><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li>New Cleaver Melee weapon now available via Event rewards.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s view could become obstructed with specific weapons when using the Dark Practitioner Tracer Pack Bundle without an optic.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens would not be visible on the Saug Mecha-Drake Mastercraft Blueprint.</li><li>Hawker Hybrid optic now correctly works with the Ginger Dread Blueprint.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Improved AAR flow.  <ul><li>Added a Dismiss button to exit at any point and a timer.</li><li>Added a Summary at the end.</li></ul></li><li>Improved readability when searching for a match.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens could not be previewed.</li></ul><p>NOTE: Some players may see their Operator selections and Operator customizations reset after this update.</p><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Red Light, Green Light (NEW)</b><ul><li>Young-hee is watching, so don’t misstep at the wrong time. Get on the pitch in the Red Card stadium and play three rounds of Red Light, Green Light, each two minutes long.</li><li>In Round 1, no one gets a weapon. In Rounds 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves. There’s just one simple rule: When Young-hee says “Green Light,” the fight is on. Move a muscle after she says “Red Light” and you’re toast.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Pentathlon (NEW)</b><ul><li>Prove that you have what it takes in the long run by competing in a series of Multiplayer modes to find out who reigns supreme! Play Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint along with two new mode variants: Piggy Bank Team Deathmatch and Roulette.  <ul><li>In Piggy Bank TDM, every elimination adds score to the Mega Piggy Bank; fight for possession of the huge payout when it drops part way through the match.</li><li>In Roulette, one-shot eliminations via the Roulette Handgun award double the points, though with each fired shot there’s a chance it’ll blow up in your hands!</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Squid Game Moshpit (NEW)</b><ul><li>Fire up the Squid Game Moshpit including Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint with a twist as players gain access to three important Squid Game-themed features:  <ul><li>Red Light, Green Light Scorestreak: Is the fight getting too hectic for you? Stop the enemy in their tracks with this Scorestreak that calls “Red Light,” commanding all enemy players to stop moving or risk elimination.</li><li>Piggy Bank: Eliminated players have a chance of dropping a Piggy Bank that awards a small score boost when picked up. For a bigger payday, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within.</li><li>Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly. The catch? Your location will be marked for everyone to see, and every shot has a chance to blow up the weapon, taking you down with it.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Prop Hunt</b><ul><li>Improved spatial audio on Prop whistles.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Prop UI could remain present when switching rounds to the Hunter team.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Props could block doors from opening when locked in place.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Wildcards</h4><ul><li><b>High Roller (NEW)</b><ul><li>Allows players to equip up to four Scorestreaks.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Scorestreaks</h4><ul><li><b>RC-XD</b><ul><li>Slightly reduced the RC-XD’s max damage.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Archangel Launcher</b><ul><li>Addressed a rare issue where the next bullet fired from a weapon after using the Archangel Launcher could be an Archangel rocket.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Care Package</b><ul><li>Care Packages will now contain the Scout Pulse Scorestreak less frequently.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>LDBR</b><ul><li>Decreased the damage the LDBR does to its owner.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 950 to 800.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Sentry Turret</b><ul><li>Increased Sentry Turret fire rate.</li><li>Increased Sentry Turret HP.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1000 to 950.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Hellstorm</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1050 to 1000.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Watchdog Helo</b><ul><li>Slightly increased the Watchdog Helo’s damage.</li><li>Increased Watchdog Helo accuracy when it acquires a new target.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1100 to 1050.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Strategic Bomber</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1300 to 1100.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>A.G.R.

When the dreaded “Dead Light” phase begins, prepare for a tough fight as a meaner wave of enemies approach.</li><li>Available first in Citadelle des Morts, with Liberty Falls added after Week 1.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Directed Mode</b><ul><li>Directed Mode now available for Citadelle des Morts with unique rewards.  <ul><li>NOTE: The deadline to earn the Main Quest early completion rewards for Citadelle des Morts via Standard Mode has been extended until the end of Season 01 to allow players additional time to complete the Main Quest.</li></ul></li><li>Extended time between rounds and the delay between spawning zombies after five looped rounds at the round cap in Directed Mode.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Training Course</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue that would prevent the “Getting New Weapons” station from progressing.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where players would lose the ability to equip a second weapon if the “Weapon Cycle” setting was enabled.</li></ul><h4>GobbleGums</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue that left the player vulnerable briefly while teleporting from “Anywhere But Here!” or “Nowhere But There” GobbleGums.</li></ul><h4>Ammo Mods</h4><ul><li><b>Shadow Rift</b><ul><li><b>Big Game</b><ul><li>Big Game will no longer deal lethal damage to Elite enemies.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Field Upgrades</h4><ul><li><b>Aether Shroud</b><ul><li><b>Void Sheath Augment</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where melee weapon damage would not be increased.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Scorestreaks</h4><ul><li><b>Mutant Injection</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where Mangler Cannon effects could be stuck on the screen after the Scorestreak has ended.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Chopper Gunner</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the gun from the Chopper Gunner could be used after the Scorestreak has ended.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Sentry Turret</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue that prevented a Sentry Turret from being placed after using the Balmung charged ability.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Power-Ups</h4><ul><li><b>Fire Sale</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where rarely Fire Sale would leave an extra Mystery Box on the map.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Enemies</h4><ul><li><b>Doppelghast</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the needle blast from a Doppelghast affected by Brain Rot could harm the player.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Vermin</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where Vermin could sometimes hit twice with one attack.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Activities</h4><ul><li><b>Splitscreen</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where zombies would sometimes ignore the host player.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Challenges</h4><ul><li><b>Camo Challenges</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where Pack-a-Punched GS45s would not progress the Siamese Camo after Military Camo progression was complete.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Daily Challenges</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Drink 3 Perk-a-Colas” Daily Challenge would not progress.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Calling Card Challenges</b><ul><li><b>Prestige 3: Explosive Surprise</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Explosive Surprise Prestige 3 Calling Chard Challenge was not tracking properly.</li></ul></li><li><b>Prestige 8: Close Call</b><ul><li>Updated this Challenge to count kills from teleporting with the “Anywhere But Here!” GobbleGum.</li><li>Updated this Challenge to also include “Nowhere But There!” GobbleGums.</li></ul></li><li>Addressed issues that prevented the following challenges from tracking properly:  <ul><li>Trophy Hunter: “Madness”</li><li>Prestige 6: “Gullible”</li><li>Prestige 7: “Old Faithful”</li><li>Prestige 10: “Stupify"</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Warzone</strong></h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue allowing players to gain the benefits of the Battle Ready Wildcard while grabbing a loadout with a different Wildcard.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing enemy parachute opening sounds from occluding properly, making it seem enemies parachuting are closer than they were.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing players from using an Advanced UAV after already calling one in during the match.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing controller players from using a Killstreak if it is not appearing on the HUD.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing players from dropping stacks of $500.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing spawn protection on Rebirth Island from functioning properly.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing the exfil animation from playing in Ranked Play.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could kick players out of a match when leaving a chat channel.</li></ul>

<h2>WWE 2K24 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>WWE 2K24 is a great game to get stuck into if you're looking to participate in some competition against friends and family. Alternatively, there's the career mode, where you work your way up the rankings and become an iconic wrestler of WWE. Compared to previous years, they've made some major improvements and made the game more immersive, allowing for a more realistic experience compared to some of the previous WWE games. Below is an excerpt from Nathan Birch's review.</p>
<p><em>With the release of WWE 2K24, this series no longer feels like a carny outcast amongst the other big sports franchises. While the game’s core action could stand to be even further refined, fun new mechanics, match types, and a fully-developed suite of modes, including significantly improved Showcase and MyGM offerings, are worth cheering for. While maybe not quite the total package just yet, WWE 2K24 feels like it’s ready for the bright lights.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>EA Sports FC 25</h2>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 was one of the most popular sports games to be released this year, according to information from both Circana and Newzoo. Ultimately, it's not too surprising. EA Sports FC is the replacement for the FIFA games and remains just as popular even without the official FIFA license. For a significant amount of time this year, it was one of the top games in the charts. It's the perfect game to be a sweaty gamer in. There were some <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major improvements to the game</a>, such as the introduction of the 5v5 <a href="https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rush mode</a> as well as the addition of being able to play using the women's teams the same way you would utilize the men's teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>F1 24</h2>
<p>Released in May, this is the perfect game for any petrolheads or fans of racing games. Compared to previous games in the franchise, F1 24 is very beginner-friendly and more accessible compared to previous iterations. There is plenty of variety, with 20 drivers and 10 teams to explore, not to mention the ability to <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-career-mode-finally-lets-you-play-as-a-current-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play in the career mode</a> as one of the current superstars. The handling model <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-features-dynamic-handling-the-series-most-comprehensive-physics-update-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a physics update</a>, too. Whether you decide to play and compete online against others or you play solely by yourself against AI in the Driver Career mode, there is a lot of replayability and promise from F1 24.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>EA Sports College Football 25</h2>
<p>One of the other major successful sports games of the year is EA Sports College Football 25. This game took off and was one of the best-sellers on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. Fans who liked the College Football franchise had to wait a whopping 11 years between NCAA Football 14 and EA Sports College Football 25. While the actual football games were a massive part of the game, there were a lot of other features that made it enjoyable, including scheduling visits to colleges, getting to know the recruits, and playing with teams that are less significant than NFL teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>MotoGP 24</h2>
<p>Compared to previous iterations in the MotoGP franchise, this game didn't get a lot of new content or updates that made the game stand out from the crowd. That being said, it's a stunning game and offers the exhilarating experience that fans of this racing franchise are familiar with. While there wasn't much added in particular regarding racing, there were some pretty groundbreaking changes. This includes new transfer markets and being able to adapt the difficulty to your liking.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/ken-levine-bioshock-corridor-games-design-1851732250<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent interview with <em>Games Industry.biz</em></a></span>, Ken Levine disparaged his most famous and popular game, <em>BioShock</em>, as “a very, very long corridor.” He uses this description pejoratively to distinguish the 2007 first-person mystery game from his current project, science fiction FPS <em>Judas</em>, a game he says is being made “very, very differently.” He wants, as a consequence of this, for <em>Judas </em>to be “much more…reflective of players’ agency.” But I want to step in and argue for the corridor, for why the contemporary widespread abandoning of them has allowed some of the most compelling aspects of gaming to become lost.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,196013" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Before we get in the weeds, what does Levine, and indeed everyone else, mean by a “corridor”? It’s the notion that there’s only one core route through a game, a pre-determined path down which all players must tread, where we do not have the freedom to pick our own directions. As such, looking back from our current era in which open-world games dominate the AAA landscape, this can give the appearance of a design that removes or restricts player agency to a deletory result.</p><p>And to be incredibly clear, some corridors did just that. While first-person games were born in level-based mazes (<em>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, etc), there did come a wake of games that were almost literal corridors, so ridiculously restrictive that it felt like being dragged down their inevitable tunnel by your nostrils, shoulders scraping the claustrophobic walls all the way. To name names, the very worst of these were the <em>Call of Duty</em> campaigns from <em>Black Ops</em> onward—games that killed you if you dared to walk left or right, rather than straight on, and pushed you to the back to watch the NPCs play the game for you.</p><p>But I would argue that almost no one who played <em>BioShock</em> in 2007 reacted by saying, “Damn, that was just a corridor.” Because it was a game that, despite having only one core pathway, allowed players to feel an enormous sense of freedom. You chose <em>huge</em> amounts in <em>BioShock</em>, from how you actually played (run-and-gun shooter, device-based trapping and stealth, immersive sim), to how you responded to the nature of the world around you, not least in how you treated the Little Sisters. People celebrated the game for the amazing amount of freedom it offered within such a tightly scripted narrative, and all of that is to ignore that the game being a prescribed corridor was <em>the <strong>entire point</strong></em>.</p><p>Sorry to spoil an 18-year-old game, but the fact that you had no choice but to follow the instructions you were given was the massive third-act reveal. That the game was set in an inescapable corridor is so much of why <em>BioShock</em> was brilliant, because if it had let players visit any point in the underwater city of Rapture whenever they wanted, everything else about it would have fallen apart.</p><p><em>BioShock</em>’s drama so often depends on you being exactly where the game designer wants you to be, at exactly the moment they want you there, and that kind of precise narrative choreography is the result of a corridor. By rejecting such game design as a failure, we’re losing this kind of experience, and I really believe it’s something we should instead be fighting to save.</p><figure id="" data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course corridors are, and should be, only a part of games. I’m not silly, I love a fantastic open-world game, and of course have been playing RPGs since the 1980s that offer vast amounts of player freedom when approaching their worlds. I’m not for a moment arguing for anything more than a desire to preserve the corridor as an option among so much else, and therefore not to disparage it as if a failure of the past. Because damn, it brought so much success.</p><p>I don’t think I’m necessarily being that huge of a maverick here. In fact, if you look at any number of “all time best games” lists, and adjust for recency bias, there are certain names that come up again and again: <em>Half-Life 2</em>, <em>Deus Ex</em>, <em>Quake 2</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>. They share space on those lists with games that do quite the opposite, the litany of wonderful RPGs that often eschew corridors entirely, but those games with straight paths undeniably dominate. Indeed, they are the shining examples of how to hide the corridor in the best possible ways.</p><p>But rather than getting into the nitty-gritty of how and why disguising the corridor was key to their success, let’s focus more on what’s being lost without them.</p><p>Open worlds are <em>great</em>, and I’m very happy to be clearing up icons in an Ubisoft map or picking my own unique route through the acts of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. But what they cannot do as well is puppeteer the player, creating deliberate, narrative moments on a deliberate, narrative path. They cannot offer something more akin to the scenes of a movie, where the impact of event B is so much more meaningful because it came directly as a response to the action of event A, and the consequence of this drives the emotional resonance of event C.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I remember, in the early 00s, at the beginning of the rejection of corridor gaming as a design choice, responding with the same argument that springs to mind now: “Do you reject having to read the pages of a book in order? Is the book a failure if page 37 comes after page 36 every time?” To which the immediate counter is, “Games aren’t books, that’s why we call them something else,” and sure, but my point is: games <em>can</em> aim to be like books in some of the best ways. Because, when your game is set in a corridor, when the scenes are as inevitable as the pages of the book, it’s how we interact with them that defines them. It places the emphasis on our own personal interpretation of what we’re offered, and rather than being a sandbox in which we can play god, we’re instead inside a story which we have the means to uniquely experience.</p><p>(In fact, this is the basis for why I’ve argued that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is not a failure to recognize player agency</a></span>, but instead a scripted moment understood uniquely based on your personal experiences accrued across all three games.)</p><p>Agency can be wonderful, but it is often at a cost—the cost of a curated, directed, deliberate narrative experience. And yes, it wouldn’t be a good thing if all games were that, but it’s no better to look down upon it as an anachronistic shortcoming of game design. <em>BioShock</em> only worked <em>because</em> it was a corridor, and indeed was a thesis <em>on the corridor</em>, making it all the more odd of a game to throw under the bus of history. There’s value in experiencing a curated, pre-determined tale, boosted by our unique approaches born of how we turn those pages. I don’t want it to be lost, in the name of boasting “greater player agency.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-did-counter-strike-2-come-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When Counter-Strike 2 came out, it fully replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and introduced a wave of new improvements and changes. While not all the changes have been widely approved by the game’s huge playerbase, CS2 remains the most popular game played on Steam, with no signs of slowing down soon.</p>



<p>But when exactly did the Counter-Strike 2 era begin?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-counter-strike-2-come-out">When Did Counter-Strike 2 Come Out?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 officially came out on September 27, 2023, though the game was playable for some players earlier than that.</p>



<p>CS2 was originally announced back on March 22, 2023, via <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">a series of posts from Val</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">v</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">e</a> highlighting some of the new changes. These changes included the new volumetric and reactive smokes, sub-tick servers, and overhauled or visually updated maps. The game itself also came over to the Source 2 engine.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fresh off the new game announcement, Valve opened a limited test that would offer select players a chance to try out CS2. Less than two months later, in May, Counter-Strike would hit its all-time player peak at 1.8 million players. This can be attributed to the rise in players trying to get CS2 limited test access as well as the release of the Major pass for the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>Finally, on September 27, 2023, CS:GO was officially taken over by Counter-Strike 2. Response to the release was mixed, as gameplay modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone didn’t come over to CS2. Arms Race eventually was released in CS2 in the next year. Valve continues to roll out new updates addressing bugs and major issues while introducing new content.</p>



<p>How do you feel about CS2 since it came out? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It took just two days before the first layoffs of 2025 took place in the gaming industry. Netmarble F&amp;C is laying off about 20 people — roughly 25% — at the company.</p>



<p>The news was first reported by Korean news outlet <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250102076600017?section=industry/game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YNA</a>.</p>



<p>Netmarble F&amp;C is a subsidiary of the mobile games company Netmarble. The studio is currently working on its new game Demis Reborn, which is scheduled to release sometime in 2025. According to YNA, the game’s “art style and overall atmosphere were significantly revised” in order to better suite adult taste.</p>







<p>It’s also reported that the game’s release date is “likely” to be altered a bit due to the staffing changes.</p>



<p>The last two years have been the worst the games industry has seen when it comes to layoffs. After over 10,000 layoffs in 2023, 2024 <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saw an estimated 16,000+</a> jobs lost. </p>



<p>Do you think 2025 will be better or worse for layoffs in gaming? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

Get on the pitch in the Red Card stadium and play three rounds of Red Light, Green Light, each two minutes long. </li><li>In Round 1, no one gets a weapon. In Rounds 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves. There’s just one simple rule: When Young-hee says “Green Light,” the fight is on. Move a muscle after she says “Red Light” and you’re toast.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pentathlon (NEW)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Prove that you have what it takes in the long run by competing in a series of Multiplayer modes to find out who reigns supreme!

Stop the enemy in their tracks with this Scorestreak that calls “Red Light,” commanding all enemy players to stop moving or risk elimination. </li><li>Piggy Bank: Eliminated players have a chance of dropping a Piggy Bank that awards a small score boost when picked up. For a bigger payday, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within. </li><li>Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly. The catch? Your location will be marked for everyone to see, and every shot has a chance to blow up the weapon, taking you down with it.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Prop Hunt</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved spatial audio on Prop whistles.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Prop UI could remain present when switching rounds to the Hunter team.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Props could block doors from opening when locked in place.</li></ul></li></ul>Wildcards<ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>High Roller (NEW)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Allows players to equip up to four Scorestreaks.</li></ul></li></ul>Scorestreaks<ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>RC-XD</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Slightly reduced the RC-XD’s max damage. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Archangel Launcher</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed a rare issue where the next bullet fired from a weapon after using the Archangel Launcher could be an Archangel rocket.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Care Package</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Care Packages will now contain the Scout Pulse Scorestreak less frequently.</li></ul></li><li><strong>LDBR</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Decreased the damage the LDBR does to its owner.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 950 to 800.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sentry Turret</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Sentry Turret fire rate.</li><li>Increased Sentry Turret HP.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1000 to 950.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hellstorm</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced score requirement from 1050 to 1000.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Watchdog Helo</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Slightly increased the Watchdog Helo’s damage.</li><li>Increased Watchdog Helo accuracy when it acquires a new target.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1100 to 1050.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Strategic Bomber</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced score requirement from 1300 to 1100.</li></ul></li><li><strong>A.G.R.

Sega has been notoriously chill with fans of the Blue Blur using its characters in their own projects, and there are even a handful of community-driven remakes of old games that could use a modern touch-up. The one we’re talking about today is <em>Sonic Galactic</em>, a sidescroller evocative of the series’ 16-bit roots, but made to look like the series might have on the Sega Saturn. The developers over at Starteam have released a new demo, so if you want a look into an alternate universe where Sonic Team got to make a classic <em>Sonic </em>game for the Sega Saturn, you can do that right now.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196572" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Starteam <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sonicgalactic.github.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sonicgalactic.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">describes <em>Sonic Galactic</em></a></span> as “a ‘what-if’ scenario: an imagining of what Sonic Team could have potentially produced” for the Sega Saturn if the system had been more successful and Sega had produced a mainline <em>Sonic </em>game for it. However, the team also notes that it didn’t limit itself to the Saturn’s technical specifications, instead using the hardware and games that were created during the early-‘90s era as inspiration for a <em>Sonic </em>game. As a result, it looks similar to the original sidescrollers and features several returning characters, but you’ll also notice smoother animations and more vibrant scenery.

                <p>Amazon has started canceling preorders for the Nintendo 3DS version of Mighty No. 9, a game that was released almost 10 years ago. Developed by Comcept and former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mighty No. 9 was billed as a spiritual successor to Mega Man.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qsxliyc2vtv2ljcp33e4ta3y?ref_src=embed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky user</a>, Amazon UK sent a notification to them saying that their preorder for Mighty No. 9 on Nintendo 3DS was canceled due to the lack of availability. Surprisingly, this user placed the order in 2022, indicating that people were still able to preorder this version of Mighty No. 9 years after it came out on other platforms.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was funded via Kickstarter and became one of the most infamous funding campaigns in video game history. The 3DS and PS Vita versions were added as stretch goals for the campaign if it hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/27/4777614/mighty-no-9-stretch-goal-ps-vita-3ds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$3.5 million, which it ended up reaching</a>.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was released in <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mighty-no-9/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 for PC, PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One</a>. However, it looks like the 3DS and Vita versions will never come to fruition. Inafune has since moved on to other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-times-new-trailer-shows-off-new-jobs-and-island-customization/1100-6519560/" data-ref-id="1100-6519560">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which is set to release sometime in 2025.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-no-9-review/1900-6416453/" data-ref-id="1900-6416453">Mighty No. 9 review</a>, we said, "For a game that's meant to bear the legacy of a classic series, Mighty No. 9 barely succeeds. It may rouse excitement from time to time, but by and large, it lacks a pervading sense of artistry, both in its level design and presentation."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, Mac, and other Linux-based enjoyers of superhero shooter hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> can once again play without fear of being pulped under an unlawfully swung banhammer. Developers NetEase had recently doled out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">bans of up to 100 years</a> to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-apologizes-for-mistakenly-banning-players-for-using-cheats">IGN</a>, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating," NetEase’s <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1193841000108531764/1201833362399170560/1324661682936746075">Discord</a> statement reads, perhaps not with the kind of wording I’d use if I’d just banned players who are playing fairly and without cheating. It continues: "We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players. We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused."</p>
<p>Proof, there, that justice can be served by apologetic executives just as effectively as vigilante supersoldiers and/or sentient trees. I haven’t played Marvel Rivals – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-review">Ed’s review</a> would have put me off even I hadn’t already had my fill of hero shooters – but I do note that Valve have rated it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/">Playable for the Steam Deck</a>, so the number of falsely condemned SteamOS players could have been substantial from that alone.</p>
<p>Proton, the specific compatibility layer that SteamOS integrates, does have some past form for triggering certain anti-cheat systems, though in the Deck’s early days this was more down to a simple lack of software compatibility rather than genuine concerns over Proton’s potential dodginess. Still, the prospect of exposing games to the untameable, open-source Linux still spooks some developers. Fortnite has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-wont-get-steam-deck-support-epic-ceo-blames-cheaters">never worked on SteamOS</a>, for one, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">cut support</a> over potential cheating concerns.</p>
<p>Fair play to NetEase for refraining from such a heavy handed approach, even if you <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-rivals-winnie-the-pooh-banned">still can't mention Winnie the Pooh</a> in its chat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia is gearing up to announce its next-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, and with it will come the next era of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). According to a leaked store listing, Nvidia DLSS 4 is set to release alongside the new GPUs.</p>



<p>Spotted on social media by <a href="https://x.com/GawroskiT/status/1874834447046168734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomasz Gawroński</a>, a European listing for an Asus RTX 5080 card retailing for €1,699.95 mentions the previously leaked GDDR7 VRAM along with “DLSS4”. While many assumed that the image was fake, noted hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1875039748122878433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kopite7kimi</a> confirmed that DLSS 4 was accurate.</p>



<p>No other details about DLSS 4 were provided. Features along with compatibility for last-gen RTX 40 Series cards should be announced when it’s officially revealed.</p>



<p>Nvidia is scheduled to announce the first RTX 50 Series graphics cards at CES 2025. CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote presentation on January 6 at 930pm ET/ 630pm PT. </p>



<p>You can check out the rumored specs for the first three cards in the next-gen lineup below. It’s worth noting that until details are official, the specs should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

                <p>If you've ever wondered about your skill level in Call of Duty, you now have a way to find out. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have discovered a way to get Activision to provide their previously hidden SBMM ratings, and it's really easy.</p><p>TheXclusiveAce has shared the method on his YouTube channel, which lays out the simple steps to get your personalized SBMM report going back to 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-personnel-problems/1900-6417780/" data-ref-id="1900-6417780">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a>. As noted by TheXclusiveAce, each report includes some highly personal data including your IP address, so think twice before sharing it unedited.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ6Zw8tADVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZ6Zw8tADVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get access, the first step is to visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's privacy page</a> and login to your Activision account. TheXclusiveAce also mentioned that he had to login to his PSN account as well. After that, submit a personal information access request. Prior to the video above, the wait time was around a day before Activision e-mailed the file out. But since this method is now widely known, there may be additional delays.</p><p>The report itself is a very through examination of each player's Call of Duty history, as it tracks every match played, as well as the mode, the operator who was used, the number of hits taken, the longest streak, and more. It's a lot to take in. The report also charts the course of each player's skill ranking as it rises or falls depending upon their activities in the games.</p><p>SBMM ratings are used to place Call of Duty players in lobbies with similarly skilled players, as determined by Activision's criteria. Not every player may agree with these assessments, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-player-pleads-with-call-of-duty-to-put-him-in-the-trash-lobbies/1100-6528596/" data-ref-id="1100-6528596">NBA's Donovan Mitchell recently pleaded with Activision</a> to put him "in the trash lobbies." Over time, it's possible that the most experienced Call of Duty players may be able to utilize the info in their player reports to enhance their ratings.</p><p>Recently, Activision debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">a stoner-lizard DLC</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.

Meanwhile, Treyarch unveiled a collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/" data-ref-id="1100-6528158">Black Ops 6 and Netflix's Squid Game</a>.</p>

            <p>Atari has shared a sneak peek at its upcoming "iconic" handheld console, Gamestation Go.</p>
<p>Whilst the company has given very little in terms of detail, it does reveal the handheld's final look with the accompanying text: "An icon, reimagined".</p>

<p>The teaser shows off the console's button layout, and it all looks very much what you'd expect from a handheld console released in 2025. But it also confirms the system will come with both a paddle and a Trak-Ball, plus a number keypad on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>That's it, though - we don't get a release date or anything else concrete, but with CES 2025 just around the corner commencing 7th January, hopefully we'll discover some of the finer details next week.</p>
<p>On the plus side, we also had a cheeky glimpse of My Arcade, which will hopefully include some Intellivision goodies after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">Atari purchased the brand last year</a>, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest-running console war in history".</p>
<p>Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Falcons organization officially announced the signing of Bosnian Counter-Strike superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač today, successfully bringing on the star that once rebuked them. The first significant domino to fall during the latest post-CS2 Major transfer window has fallen. </p>



<p>The plethora of resources available to the Saudi organization have finally led to the star they’ve always wanted, and the move has drastically altered the competitive CS2 landscape.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-second-time-s-the-charm">Second Time’s The Charm</h2>



<p>This is Falcons’ second time going after NiKo, having spent most of 2023 pursuing one of Counter-Strike’s greatest riflers. Though at the end of 2023, NiKo pivoted and chose to remain with G2 Esports for the 2024 season. G2 and NiKo fell just short of winning the Major that still eludes them, but the 2024 campaign was still a successful one. Russian AWP prodigy Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blossomed into one of the best players in the world</a>, and G2 capitalized on the signing of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guatemalan sensation Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</a>. G2 lifted trophies at IEM Dallas, the BLAST Fall Final, and the BLAST World Final in 2024.</p>



<p>Despite the presence of the legendary Emil “Magisk” Reif, Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen, and coach Danny “zonic” Sørensen, it was a turbulent and forgettable 2024 season for Falcons. The roster struggled throughout the year, even with Oleksandr “⁠s1mple⁠” Kostyliev playing with them on loan. The nail in the coffin was failing to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major, prompting Falcons to discontinue s1mple’s loan and bench everyone not named Magisk.</p>

<p>Falcons are <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40627/sources-falcons-in-talks-over-heroic-trio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly considering</a> the trio of Damjan “⁠kyxsan⁠” Stoilkovski, René “⁠TeSeS⁠” Madsen and Abdul “⁠degster⁠” Gasanov, who all currently play for Danish organization Heroic. But this is the result of another instance in which Falcons have been denied the player they really want, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G2 has reportedly closed off talks for previously mentioned m0NESY</a>.</p>



<p>With the big NiKo domino now fallen, and the post-Major break ending in less than two weeks, many more new signings and transfers are expected over the next few days. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several more GameStop stores appear to be closing down, although there's technically been no real official announcement from the company or its management regarding these closures (save for one small detail in an SEC filing).</p>

<p>Over on the GameStop subreddit, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hsbjt5/my_first_thought_when_i_heard_my_store_was_closing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">number</a> of GameStop <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs3a1i/well_guys_its_been_nice/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">employees</a>&nbsp;are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs7n3n/my_store_has_been_culled/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declaring</a> that their stores are being closed. Sorting posts by most recent on the subreddit shows tons of posts pertaining to store closures, although the posts don't name which stores are closing.</p>

<p>That might be owing to the policy outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs5bok/to_our_concerned_guests_do_not_ask/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> by GameStop assistant store leader ArcherFawkes, who claims that if employees share information about a store's closure with customers, they'll be punished. As such, users are directed not to "ask for what stores are closing", as they "cannot tell you outright".</p>

<p>Technically speaking, GameStop management hasn't made an official public-facing announcement of these closures, although in an <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/2c1eac18-9f79-41b9-9e56-a8db8fe7aac4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEC filing from mid-S</a><a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/20696/html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eptember</a>, company management said an ongoing review "may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years".</p>

<p>These closures come after GameStop announced back in March <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that it had closed 287 stores</a> over the previous fiscal year, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-closing-180-200-stores" rel="nofollow">hundreds</a> of other store closures in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previous years</a>.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-discloses-third-quarter-2024-results" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earnings release</a>, GameStop acknowledges that its net sales have dropped from $1.078 billion in last year's third quarter to just $860m in the same period this fiscal year, although net income for the third quarter was $17.5 million, up from a $3.1 million loss during the same period last year.</p>

<p>The situation eventually got so out of hand that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/white-house-economic-team-monitoring-gamestop-stock-situation" rel="nofollow">attracted the US government's attention</a>. Eventually, author Ben Mezrich would write a book,&nbsp;<em>The Antisocial Network</em>, chronicling the debacle, with that book later becoming a major Hollywood motion picture by the name of&nbsp;<em>Dumb Money</em>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming weeks with regards to GameStop store closures, but for now, if you're a company employee, it might be best to check with your management regarding what's going on with your store.</p>
