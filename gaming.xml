Those include a possible launch date of November 19. While <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm those specifics, the Switch port of <em>MySims </em>is real and coming soon, according to a source familiar with the plans. EA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>MySims </em>was a 2007 game for Wii and DS where players marshaled dozens of Mii-like custom characters in an effort to re-develop a town. Blueprints for building stuff are unlocked and a resource called essence is earned and exploited to design cool things. If you want to know what was so special about these games for some people, you can check out the sparse but still passionate MySims subreddit where long-time fans will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regale you with tales</a></span> of their favorite quirks, characters, and story beats.</p><p>There were also a bunch of sequel spin-offs with different themes ranging from the medieval <em>MySims: Kingdom</em> to the vehicle-based <em>MySims: Racing</em>. The characters in them offered a bit more of a whimsical approach to the Sims formula then the ever expanding suite of options in the hit <em>Sims 4</em>. Most of the <em>MySims </em>games were made by EA Redwood Shores, the studio best known for <em>Dead Space </em>which was later rebranded Visceral and shut down by EA in 2017. </p><p>It’s unclear if the return of <em>MySims</em> means that’s where EA’s ambitions for <em>The Sims</em> on Switch will end, with many fans still holding out hope that <em>The Sims 4</em> or another version of the mainline series would eventually get ported to Nintendo’s handheld hybrid console. Maybe the publisher is waiting until a Switch 2 is out to announce that, or maybe the <em>MySims</em> revival is the best that Sims fans on Nintendo’s platform are getting right now. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was looking a bit touch-and-go for real-time stealth-tactics fans after developer Mimimi Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-developer-announces-final-ever-release">shut up shop</a> following last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth-gets-a-rip-roaring-pirate-upgrade">superb Shadow Tactics</a>. But thankfully it seems there's more than a little life left in the genre, what with the imminent arrival of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumerian-sixs-pulpy-stealth-tactics-almost-manages-to-fill-that-mimimi-shaped-hole">promising Sumerian Six</a> and now this: a new Goya-inspired stealth-tactics adventure from The Game Kitchen, the studio behind the wonderfully moody <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> series.
</p>
<p>
The Stone of Madness, as it's known, transports players back in time to an 18th-century Spanish Monastery - serving as both a prison and an asylum - located somewhere in the Pyrenees mountains. Here, five prisoners plan their escape through its gloomy corridors, which, of course, is where all the real-time stealthy stuff starts to come in.
</p>
<p>
As the adventure unfolds - well <em>adventures</em>, given it promises two fully fledged campaigns, each with unique stories, objectives, and characters - players will alternately control five distinct characters: Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo. Each has their own unique upgradeable skills, enabling them to - among other things - cast spells, distract and kill enemies, stun evil spirits, and access hard-to-reach areas.

<p>
However, The Stone of Madness also takes a page from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>'s playbook, meaning characters also have traumas and phobias players will need to deal with. If these are triggered during their escape, their sanity depletes, eventually causing paranoia, dementia, violent outbursts, and more - "fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played".
</p>
<p>
There are further wrinkles promised, too, with players also needing to take into account the time of day. Perhaps unexpectedly, sneaking, exploration, and gathering materials are said to be safer in the daylight, when guards are more easily distracted. However, as time passes, the monastery's ghostly inhabitants will begin to reveal themselves, affecting characters' sanity. And when night falls, the curfew coming into effect, security is much tighter. The Game Kitchen says players might prefer to plan and manage their escape after dark, but teases the rewards found after nightfall might be worth the risk...
</p>
<p>
It's intriguing stuff, and The Stone of Madness is currently set to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-stone-of-madness-7b22f3">Epic</a> early next year. And if you fancy a bit of tactical action before then (albeit not of the real-time or stealthy kind), might I suggest you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-breach-wizards-review">pop over here</a>?

		<p>It’s been a busy old week in video games, and so the fitting way to spend my Friday afternoon is to tap out a quick catch up on What We Played, which travelling on a very delayed, very diverted train to escape Cologne. Wish me luck in my continuing adventures!</p>
<p>But train travails is now what we’re really here to talk about, and Dom and I had a jam-packed week of previewing games at Gamescom 2024. We’ve played and seen around 40 games between us, both big and small, and we’ll be churning out our features and write ups over the coming fortnight. But what have we enjoyed seeing the most?</p>

<p>For me, the three games that I’d pick out as highlights were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/rebellion-reveal-atomfall-which-looks-a-bit-like-fallout-goes-british/">Atomfall</a> by those folks at Rebellion, a game which is probably a good bit different to what you think, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">Civilization VII</a>, which is exploring some fascinating ideas for the 4X genre, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/22/rogue-waters-sails-the-turn-based-tactical-roguelite-seas-in-september/">Rogue Waters</a>, which has a really fun take on turn-based tactical gameplay that’s a lot about positioning and cascading abilities.</p>
<p>As for <strong>Dom</strong>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/07/metaphor-refantazio-trailer-showcases-why-you-should-get-excited-for-this-rpg/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was one game that really stood out, and he rather enjoyed how very British is felt, Dying Light: The Beast with the return of Kyle Crane, and then the musical RPG of Fretless.</p>

<p>On to everyone else, and<strong> Nic B</strong> has continued to enjoy his time with MTG Arena, exploring the online-only pre-con decks, and a smidgeon of Monster Hunter Now.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> continuing adventures in Fallout: New Vegas have taken him into the Lonesome Road DLC, which has been a nice narrative detour (with a big difficulty spike). He’s also tried out Rise of Ronin using his PS Portal, which wasn’t quite conducive to the split-second reflexes needed. And most significantly, he’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> for our review, “As a lapsed Overwatch addict, it’s definitely hitting that hero shooter sweet spot, with a vibrant catch of heroes who each tout markedly different playstyles.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been on the review train with an eclectic mix of Truck racing with Monster Jam Showdown, old-school Zelda-ing with Crypt Custodian, and a spot of retro 2D shoot ’em up-ing with Shadow of the Ninja Reborn. <strong>Aran</strong> in the same carriage, playing Gori: Cuddly Carnage for review and Beyond Galaxyland for a preview.</p>
<p>The re-release of the TimeSplitters trilogy on PS5 had <strong>Miguel</strong> diving back into these FPS classics, but he’s still spent most of his time with Ace Combat 5. From there, “a really wild racing game kick” bounced him between&nbsp;Ride Ridge 2, Ridge Racer 6, F1 2023, Split/Second and Midnight Club Los Angeles.</p>

<p>And finally, we come to <strong>Gamoc</strong>. He’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. The review embargo isn’t up until Monday at 2PM, so keep an eye out for something around about then!</p>
<p><em>Now, what have you been playing this week?</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Developers Confirm 30 FPS Was The Target In Development]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target-in-development.962085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview with members of the Iron Lords Podcast, Matt Hansen, Art Director, and Ryan Warden, Production Director, sat down to talk about Avowed and what players can expect from the game. One of the most surprising things from <a href="https://x.com/GPTGamingNews/status/1826920564700631363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the interview</a> was that their target during development for Avowed was 30 FPS across the board. Considering Avowed is a first-person action RPG, this number surprises quite a few people. While many are defending their statement, saying that you don't necessarily need 60 FPS for a game like this, some wholeheartedly believe that 60 FPS should be the bare minimum.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exclusive Avowed Interview Ft @MrMattyPlays | Gameplay Q&amp;A | Xbox Consoles 30FPS? | Gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AxBL4jTHs5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, they haven't explicitly said whether the game will be able to run at 60 FPS or not, but they have expressed that Avowed will hit 30 FPS with plenty of flashy effects in place to make the game more desirable.</p>
<p>Much like in <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-possible-endings-now-reach-into-double-digits/">another post</a> we wrote about Avowed, there are macro and micro endings for players to achieve. Those excited to get into the game now know that the ending slides have reached double digits. However, how many are macro endings remains to be confirmed, with multiple variations. According to the interview, though, there are well over 50 variations for players to encounter.</p>
<p>In Avowed, players will play as the Envoy from the Aedyrian Empire, where they are then sent on a mission to the Living Lands to investigate the Soul Plague. While this game does take place in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, the two stories are not directly connected. However, playing Pillars of Eternity does offer the opportunity to get some additional context for Avowed.</p>
<p>The interview with the developers dove into some other essential details for Avowed, such as the lack of a traditional class system. Instead, players are given full authority to explore abilities as they wish, mixing and matching abilities from classes to create the hybrid class that works for them. This helps contribute to the many different ways players can play the game, allowing them as much freedom as they want to create their playstyle that suits them for the journey through Avowed.</p>
<p>The full interview is over thirty minutes long, and they break down plenty of important factors of Avowed, such as the delays that the game experienced, the world-building, and trying to make it seem as dense and populated as possible.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the developers of Avowed will see the mixed opinions on the 30 FPS choice for the game or not, but there is the possibility that they will later make a statement about it or begin to tailor the game to run at a higher FPS for those who want a smoother experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a frankly insane milestone just three days after the game's release, developer and publisher GameScience has announced.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has sold 10 million copies since launch. As a reminder, the game was released on August 20th, which was just three days ago.</p>
<p>GameScience thanks players for their "support and love" for the game, wishing everyone a "great gaming weekend" in the post. The developer also includes some artwork of the player character clutching his healing gourd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=O4uKjVkD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=bioaCDcX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has done some serious numbers.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has the game reached 10 million sales, but it's also managed to achieve a total of three million concurrent players across both platforms on which it's currently available (PC and PlayStation 5, in case you're wondering).</p>
<p>It's fair to say the rise of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has been meteoric, to say the least. Since being announced back in 2020, hype for the game has built and built, resulting in&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>being the most-wishlisted game on Steam prior to its release.</p>
<p>After its launch, the game quickly began to climb the Steam charts, topping the 24-hour concurrent player count list <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count">within just a handful of hours</a>. Further success seemed inevitable, and, indeed, so it has proven.</p>
<p>The rapidity of&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s rise can, it seems, largely be attributed to Chinese players. As <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/black-myth-wukong-behind-the-numbers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this (paywalled) article from GameDiscoverCo</a> points out, around 88% of the game's player base is based in China, and 94% of&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s Steam reviews are in simplified Chinese.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s developer is Chinese, it perhaps stands to reason that the majority of the game's players would be in the studio's native country. Still, it demonstrates the power of China as a demographic when it comes to gaming.</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, with an Xbox Series X|S version planned for later down the line. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business">read my review here</a> if you want to know why I think it deserves its immense success.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake launches in October, and many fans have wondered about game length and how long it’ll take to beat the game. Now, thanks to the game’s creative director, we have an answer.</p>



<p>In responding to <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1825636867900838162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">questions on Twitter</a>, creative director Mateusz Lenart says that Silent Hill 2 remake should take between 16-18 hours to beat on the first playthrough. He then added that it could taken even longer than that depending on how you play.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“If you like to spent your time searching for everything that we put into the game and things we’ve hidden for you, it will take you more than 20 [hours] for sure,” he said. “I’m not counting the new game plus and all endings of course. </p>



<p>“I’m curious how fast will you get all of them.”</p>



<p>As far as the time length goes, a 16- to 18-hour playthrough puts the remake ahead of <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/8523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">what the completionist time</a> is for the original Silent Hill 2 from 2001. And, for the most part, fans seem excited about the extended time to play the game.</p>



<p>“That is some very pleasantly surprising news,” <a href="https://x.com/Micahmakefunny/status/1826753846447894726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user said</a>.</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/LukeCastles1/status/1826699655495000315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>, “That’s a lot longer than the original, I’m very excited for this.”</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake releases October 8 for PlayStation 5 and PC. The game is a PS5 console exclusive for at least a year, according to reports. After which, it will be able to come to Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>We're big proponents of gaming headsets. They create a private, immersive listening experience that can make games more engrossing. Some games even encourage you to wear one to get the best audio experience. Gaming headsets are integral to the online multiplayer experience, not just for chatting with friends, but because it's often easier to pinpoint audio cues while wearing one. <span>While some may prefer the immediacy and simplicity of wired headsets, the freedom afforded by wireless headsets is unmatched. And thanks to low-latency 2.4GHz connections and modern Bluetooth technology, issues that plagued wireless headsets in the early gaming headset boom, like playback delay or lower audio quality, are virtually unheard of if you buy from a decent brand. Wireless headsets can sound as good and perform as reliably as their wired counterparts.</span></p><p>For anyone out there looking for a new gaming headset, we've put together this list of the best wireless gaming headsets you can buy in 2024. If you've read any of our other headset roundups, you won't be surprised to see the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a> in the top slot as the best wireless gaming headset in 2024. We simply haven't found any competitors that can match its blend of high quality audio, comfort, and price. That said, it's not our only recommendation. Some users will want something more affordable, while others may be able to splurge on higher-end models that offer even more features. So, we've made sure to include picks from a variety of price points, features, and styles--including a couple of wireless earbud options, led by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's Inzone Buds</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for more recommendations, including wired models, be sure to check out our lists of the best headsets for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-headset/1100-6482578/" data-ref-id="1100-6482578">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-headset/1100-6485694/" data-ref-id="1100-6485694">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-headset/1100-6486018/" data-ref-id="1100-6486018">PC</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-mic-headset/1100-6497491/" data-ref-id="1100-6497491">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><div title="6525389 - Best Wireless gaming headsets" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2534" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6525389 - Best Wireless gaming headsets" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset\/dp\/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Wireless Gaming Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset\/dp\/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life</strong>: 38 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz; Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio:</strong> Yes (Tempest 3D Audio, 360 Spatial Audio)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Retractable noise-canceling boom mic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices:</strong> PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Switch, Steam Deck, Mobile</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Arctis Nova 7 (and its console-specific variants the 7X and 7P) take the top slots in our best headsets lists for each console and PC, so its ranking as our favorite wireless headset overall should be no surprise. Every model in SteelSeries Arctis Nova line is an excellent choice, but the Nova 7 offers the best mix of sound quality, features, and comfort without pushing into luxury-tier prices.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova 7 shares its best feature with the rest of the Arctis Nova lineup: The ComfortMax system. This ingenious adjustable suspension design gently supports the lightweight--but durable--rubber-coated steel headband above your head rather than memory foam padding like other headsets. The headband design coupled with SteelSeries' breathable AirWeave ear cushions makes the Nova 7 comfortable for long gaming sessions. However, what makes the Nova 7 stand out among its Arctis peers is its sound quality, which is second only to the high-end--and much pricier--Nova Pro. It supports 3D spatial audio and works on a wide range of devices via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova 7 comes in three versions: The standard Nova 7 works on PC, Switch, and mobile. The 7P supports all those devices, plus PS5. Meanwhile, the 7X works on Xbox and all the aforementioned devices, including PS5 with Tempest 3D Audio. The lone difference in features between the headsets is the wheel on the right earcup: The Nova 7 and 7P are equipped with a sidetone dial for microphone monitoring, while the 7X has a Chatmix dial for party chat. PC users get the most customization features thanks to the SteelSeries desktop app.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth mentioning that SteelSeries sells accessories to help you <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fheadset-accessories%3Fin_stock%3Don&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-wireless-gaming-headset%2F1100-6525389%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">customize your Nova 7 headset</a>, should you ever want to switch up its look, The earcup faceplates and elastic headband are swappable.

The Nova Pro looks like the other headsets in SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line and shares the same super-comfortable headband design, but there are some major differences that justify its higher price tag. It has a better build quality with a more robust steel-reinforced design and leatherette earcups.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova Pro connects to your PC or console wirelessly via the included base station that can be linked to two devices at once. The base station includes an OLED and a simple dial-based controls you can use to navigate the Nova Pro's many settings, including EQ, mic mix, active noise canceling, and more. Normally, features like EQ balancing would require a PC or mobile app, but since everything is handled within the base station, all of those features are available regardless of the device you're connected to. That said, PC players can use SteelSeries' Sonar software to access even more granular controls and pre-made audio profiles for specific games.</p><p dir="ltr">Another great feature of the Nova Pro is its dual-audio input support. This means you can connect to one device through the base station and another via Bluetooth and listen to both at the same time. This is great for anyone who likes to listen to podcasts or music on their mobile devices while they game on their consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">To top it all off, the Nova Pro comes with two rechargeable, hot-swappable batteries that you charge in the base station. That means you essentially have endless battery life as long as you make sure one pack is always charging. That said, the headset does allow for wired 3.5mm connections if you're in a pinch. It's also worth noting there's a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWF9BCJ?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superb wired model</a> that will save you a decent amount of cash, but you'll be missing out on some of the wireless features. Additionally, the wired version connects to SteelSeries' GameDAC, which makes it better for those who play at their desk as opposed to on the couch.</p><p>Just like with the Nova 7 series, you'll need the Xbox version of the Nova Pro for support across all consoles and PC. The Nova 7 and 7P will work with all of your consoles and PC except for Xbox.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X\/dp\/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Premium Wireless Gaming Headset (Runner-up)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X\/dp\/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Turtle Beach Stealth Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life:</strong> 12+ hours (per swappable battery pack)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz; Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes (Windows Sonic, PS5 3D Audio, Dolby Atmos, DTS Headphone: X)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling:</strong> Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Removable noise-canceling boom, plus integrated mics</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>Xbox, PlayStation, PC, Switch, Steam Deck, Mobile</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is another high-end alternative to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. One of its coolest feature is an integrated DAC (digital audio converter), which can enhance the audio quality beyond what its already excellent 50mm Nanoclear drivers would normally achieve. The only drawback to this is that it adds more internal hardware, making for a bulkier design, especially the earcups.</p><p dir="ltr">The larger design is one of the Stealth Pro's few downsides, and the rest of the headset is excellent. It features multiple mics for clear audio pickup, supports various spatial audio formats, and connects to a wide range of devices via 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth 5.1. Its active noise-canceling tech is fantastic for a gaming headset--perhaps even slightly better than what's found in the Nova Pro.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the Nova Pro, the Turtle beach also uses dual, hot-swappable battery packs. Each pack holds up to 12 hours of battery life, and features quick charging, so you can effectively keep playing indefinitely as long as you keep the extra pack charged up so you can swap them out when needed.</p><p dir="ltr">The Xbox version of the Stealth Pro works wirelessly on all platforms, whereas the PlayStation edition is compatible with everything except Xbox.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Budget Wireless Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li><strong>Battery life: </strong>60 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz, Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style: </strong>Retractable noise-canceling boom mic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices:</strong> PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC, Steam Deck, Mobile</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Yep, we've got one more Arctis Nova model for this list. If the Nova 7 and Pro are out of your price range, the Nova 5 is the option for you. It's more affordable than its siblings but still sounds great. The Nova 5 uses the ingenious headband strap design we love about the other models. It's also a touch lighter than the rest, making it even more comfortable for long-term use.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nova 5 isn't just a lighter and more affordable version of the other Arctis models, however. It also has its own unique capabilities, namely an exclusive mobile companion app available for iOS and Android that includes over 100 EQ presets for popular games like Call of Duty, Destiny, and Minecraft. The headset lets you connect to your phone via Bluetooth while also connected to a console or PC over 2.4GHz so you can swap EQs in the app on the fly. Unfortunately, you cannot listen to both sources with simultaneous connection, but that's one of our few misgivings about the Nova 5.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the app and multiple connection options, the Nova 5 also has a noise-canceling microphone that fully retracts into the left earcup, sports up to 60 hours of battery life, and has fast charging via the included USB-C cable.</p><p dir="ltr">The Arctis Nova 5 headset is available in three different models: the all-black Nova 5, the blue and black Nova 5P, and green and black Nova 5X. All three models support PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, but only the 5X supports Xbox consoles. They also support spatial audio on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Wireless Headset (Runner-Up)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset\/dp\/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Xbox-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0CXGL6G6N?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life: </strong>70 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4GHz; Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style: </strong>Detachable wideband boom mic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC, Mobile, Steam Deck</li></ul><p dir="ltr">While we might prefer the look and feel of the Nova headsets, the BlackShark V2 Pro puts up strong competition and easily ranks as one of the most comfortable headsets out there.

It supports wireless connections via Bluetooth or Razer's low-latency 2.4GHz HyperSpeed tech. The only real downside is that it lacks true active noise-canceling tech, but otherwise, this is one of the best headsets out there, and a great alternative to SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a theme on this list, but yet again, you'll need the Xbox edition for wireless support across all devices, while the PlayStation and PC editions support everything besides Xbox consoles.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N\/dp\/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Wireless Gaming Earbuds</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N\/dp\/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Sony Inzone Buds</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life: </strong>12 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>2.4 GHz; Bluetooth LE</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>Yes (Tempest 3D Audio, 360 Spatial Audio)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Multiple integrated mics</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>PS5, PC, Switch, Steam Deck, Android, iPhone 15 (older iPhones with adapter)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">So far, we've covered standard gaming headsets, but wireless earbuds are another great option for cordless audio while gaming, and the best choice is Sony's Inzone Buds. These true wireless earbuds were designed with gaming in mind with support for 360 Spatial Audio on PC and Tempest 3D Audio on PS5. The Inzone Buds also implement some of the audio giant's best tech to help them thrive beyond gaming, too.</p><p dir="ltr">From a noise-canceling standpoint, the Inzone Buds are the best option on this list. Sony is well-known as one of the best in the business for ANC, and that is on display with the manufacturer's first pair of gaming earbuds. The Inzone Buds also utilize the same drivers found in Sony's flagship <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WF-1000XM5 Bluetooth earbuds</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sony Inzone Buds last up to 12 hours on a single charge, which is pretty decent for a pair of wireless earbuds. Their design minimizes ear contact, which makes for a more comfortable wear.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Inzone gaming gear--Sony also has over-ear headphones, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Wireless-Canceling-Over-ear-Headphones/dp/B0B1TDHLPT?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">high-end Inzone H9</a> that <em>just </em>missed the cut on this list--the Inzone Buds were designed with PC gaming in mind. With the Inzone Hub Windows app, you can customize your audio experience and save your settings to the earbuds.</p><p dir="ltr">Though best suited for PC gamers, these earbuds fully support the PS5's suite of audio features. It connects to both PC and PS5 via the included USB-C dongle. You can also use the Inzone Buds on other devices with audio-supported USB-C ports, including Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">On mobile, however, things are a bit different than usual for wireless earbuds. Android users with a newer phone equipped with Bluetooth LE can ditch the dongle if they so choose, but since Apple hasn't implemented Bluetooth LE in its devices, you'll need to use the dongle. For iPhone 15 users, this isn't a big issue--unless you have a bulky case, which may require a USB-C extender to attach the dongle. Those with iPhones with legacy Lightning ports will need a Lightning to USB-C adapter that supports audio output.</p><p dir="ltr">To clear up any confusion: Inzone Buds are manufactured by Sony Electronics and released before <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PULSE-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CMDFSB89?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's Pulse Explore earbuds</a>. Sony Inzone Buds cost the same and have noise-canceling tech as well as better audio and overall design. Pulse Explore earbuds do, however, support standard Bluetooth.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized\/dp\/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Best Bluetooth Gaming Earbuds</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized\/dp\/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20">Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery life: </strong>24-30 hours with charging case (varies by model)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Bluetooth</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Noise-canceling: </strong>AirPods Pro only</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mic style:</strong> Multiple hidden noise-cancelling mics</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported Devices: </strong>PS5, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Mobile, PC, Xbox with Bluetooth adapter.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">While not traditionally thought of as a gaming peripheral, Apple's AirPods are great for gaming simply because of their ubiquity. Chances are, if you own an iPhone, you have a pair of these lying around <em>or </em>you have thought about buying a pair. Since they can pair up with any Bluetooth-supported device, you can quickly sync them to PS5, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or any other mobile device you're using for games. They work on PCs, too, provided you have integrated Bluetooth or a USB Bluetooth dongle. And for Xbox, you'll need to pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skull-Co-AudioBox-Transmitter-Controllers/dp/B09NMP462M?tag=gamespot-wirelessheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox-specific Bluetooth converter</a> like this one from Skull &amp; Co.</p><p dir="ltr">AirPods won't outclass a gaming headset or a pair of good headphones, but they sound pretty good, and their integrated mics mean they can work like a headset in a pinch. We recommend going with the AirPods Pro since they have better overall sound quality and active noise cancellation. For a cheaper but still solid option, the 3rd Gen standard AirPods are worth a look, but the 2nd Gen AirPods are still available and work great, too--especially for the price.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-two-get-one-free-nintendo-switch-games-and-preorders-my-best-buy-members/1100-6525928/">B2G1 Free All Nintendo Switch Games - Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi, And More Preorders</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

            <p>Obsidian is targeting 30fps on Xbox consoles for its fantasy RPG, Avowed.</p>
<p>In conversation with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w">Iron Lords podcast</a>, Obsidian art director Matt Hansen said the studio is "core targeting 30 frames per second, bare minimum" for the upcoming release, adding since "it's a first-person, single-player game, you don't necessarily need that 60 frames".</p>
<p>Explaining further, Hansen said this will allow the Avowed team to "get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff".</p>

<p>"It's a trade-off we opted to make relatively early, and we're really happy with that," the art director continued. "The game's running pretty smooth for, you know, how visually dense it is, and that was always our goal."</p>
<p>He did note, however, the team is still hashing out some of the final performance bits and pieces. "It's one of the last things you do," Hansen said.</p>
<p>(As a general point, earlier this year the game's director confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-can-be-played-in-third-person-obsidian-confirms">Avowed could also be played in third-person</a>, however Hansen did not mention this during the podcast.)</p>
<p>Avowed is currently set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-avowed-reportedly-delayed-from-2024-to-early-next-year">release across Xbox and PC on 18th February next year</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom went hands on with the fantasy RPG earlier this week. "I'm more intrigued than I was, certainly, now I have a novice understanding of its playstyle and story," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-plays-like-a-funny-obsidian-role-player-where-you-buddy-up-with-the-voice-of-mass-effects-garrus">Eurogamer's Avowed preview</a>.

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle was previously slated to be an Xbox exclusive. However, that idea has since been scrapped, and the game will also be coming to PlayStation 5. Xbox confirmed this on Tuesday at Gamescom Opening Night Live, where it was revealed that the game will be swinging onto PS5 in early 2025. However, those on PC and Xbox Series X|S will experience the adventure on 9 December, 2024. Today, Phil Spencer spoke about upcoming changes for Microsoft.</p>
<p>This announcement spells out a huge change happening at Xbox, as this is the latest first-party Xbox game to be announced on PS5. This year has already seen some significant announcements for Xbox, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Sea of Thieves, and Pentiment, which will also be coming to alternative platforms, such as PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>During an<a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1826246589977153723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1826246589977153723%7Ctwgr%5Efee93a41b2c89426528ec32cc9492cfb3045d0a1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Ftheres-going-to-be-more-change-phil-spencer-speaks-on-indy-ps5-news%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> interview today</a> at Gamescom, Phil Spencer was asked to comment on Xbox's latest announcement and the stark change from their previous statement regarding Indiana Jones in February.</p>
<p>"Going to the PlayStation announcement, obviously, last spring we launched four games- two of them on the Switch, four on PlayStation - and we said we are going to learn." Looking at the statistics side, having the games launch on multiple platforms other than being an Xbox exclusive greatly benefits Microsoft.</p>
<p>"What I see when I look is that our franchise are getting stronger, our Xbox console players this year are as high as they've ever been, so I look at it and I say, our player numbers are going up for the console platform, our franchise are as strong as they've ever been... and we run a business," says Phil Spencer at Gamescom.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, Phil Spencer spoke up about the changes in the gaming industry and the pressure it's facing as a whole. This year alone has seen thousands of layoffs across all types of companies in the games industry, with Microsoft included in that statistic. Spencer claimed that traditional ways of distributing games would continue to change.</p>
<p>"The last thing that I'll say is I think as an industry right now, there's a lot of pressure on the industry. It's been growing for a long time and now people are looking for ways to grow." Which, when looking at the statistics of all major gaming consoles and sales, that doesn't strictly feel true. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-sales-down-52-year-on-year-in-europe-while-ps5-sales-are-up-143/">Xbox in particular</a> has sold the least amount of units, particularly in Europe. In addition, they've also been dealing with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">complaint filed by the FTC</a> regarding their Game Pass price hike, which doesn't exactly spell good news for Microsoft.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-will-run-at-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-s.962004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian has revealed that upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will target a 30fps frame rate on Xbox Series X|S, so if you're a frame rate fanatic, you might want to pick this one up on PC.</p>
<p>This information comes via Obsidian's Matt Hansen, who's serving as art director on the RPG (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-runs-at-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-and-s-obsidian-confirms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thanks, IGN</a>). In a recent podcast interview, Hansen told the hosts that Obsidian would target a "baseline" of 30fps, and he doesn't draw any kind of distinction between the Series S and the Series X on that front.</p>
<p>Hansen says that 60fps isn't necessary for a "first-person, single-player game", and that dropping the frame rate target allows him and his studio to "get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-lizard.jpg?itok=-dmqQUaJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-lizard.jpg?itok=-G_4I7KK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Avowed won't have a high frame rate, but it will have some fancy visual effects.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Hansen, the trade-off that sacrifices a higher frame rate for nicer graphics is one he and the team decided to make "relatively early", and Obsidian is "really happy" with the call it's made.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively low frame rate target, Hansen says that&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is "running pretty smooth" considering its visual density, and that the finer points of performance are still being worked out, as they're "one of the last things" developers address.</p>
<p>As IGN points out, there's a history of developers targeting 30fps on launch, only to introduce a 60fps performance mode later. Games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-will-launch-with-30-fps-quality-mode-only-on-xbox-series-xs"><em>Redfall</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plague-tale-requiem-60-fps-mode-added-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-in-new-patch"><em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>all launched without 60fps modes, only to have performance-based options added in later.</p>
<p>There's every chance&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will go through the same process, but for now, if you're picking the game up on Xbox, you're going to have to cope with a lower frame rate.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-bear.jpg?itok=EUzQkdsy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-30fps-console-bear.jpg?itok=SSijJxgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This bear won't be moving at a silky-smooth 60fps, at least at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is, it's an upcoming fantasy RPG from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Obsidian.</p>
<p>Set in the same world as the developer's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pillars-of-eternity"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is a first-person action RPG akin to something like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, albeit hopefully with less bugs and jank on launch. It's heading to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/avowed/9nhrdqvfpq34" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 18th.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>Everything I know about the French Revolution has hitherto come from two literary works: Hilary Mantel's excellent doorstopper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_of_Greater_Safety">A Place Of Greater Safety</a>, and <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=321">Kate Beaton's webcomics</a>. Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bonaparte-a-mechanized-revolution">Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution</a>. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.</p><!--more-->
<p>Studio Imugi are made up of veterans of prolific Canadian indie publisher Kitfox Games and Sea Of Stars devs Sabotage. This is their debut game, and it very much looks like a Kitfox production - a nerdy, narrative-led alt-historical sandbox. Here's the announcement trailer...</p>

<p>...and here's some background from the press release. The game begins in 1789, and casts you as either Céline or César Bonaparte - two seemingly fictional variations upon noted megalomaniac Napoleon. The game keeps some foothold in historical record, but lets you pick your own path through the events of the Revolution. There doesn't have to be a Revolution, for starters. Guillotines are so <em>gauche</em>, after all.  You might choose to defend Marie Antoinette and her ilk against the mob, sending your troops to force-feed the peasants rhetorical cake. Or you could side with the moderates and try to reform the system somehow. Hey, it worked out so well for us British!</p>
<p>Apparently, players will be able to "see policy play out in real time on the battlefield", but it's not really clear what that amounts to from the trailer. It looks like a game of two halves: hex and turn-based battles featuring the aforesaid mechanical Colossi, and tense branching dialogue with period luminaries such as Robespierre. There's also a papery world map with army figurines which looks very Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>It's out in early 2025, and has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560340/Bonaparte__A_Mechanized_Revolution/">a Steam page</a>. I get a faint whiff of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suzerain">Suzerain</a> from the presentation, which is promising, but I'm a little concerned about the mechs, who do feel like an afterthought, skulking furtively behind the colon in the title. Or worse, a publicity gimmick. This doesn't seem to be a steampunk world in other respects. Perhaps Mantel and Beaton were in the right of things, after all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While many players have defeated the Stone Vanguard, a required boss near the Fright Cliff area, fewer have discovered Shigandang, an optional boss fight that first requires finding the six Buddha’s Eyeballs.

As one player points out, in order to do that, it seems like you need to arrive in the Fright Cliffs through the Squall Hideout rather than the bridge and cave most players are likely to enter from.  you need to have not come into this area via the bridge and cave.

But it’s neat that the required boss fight is finished for you and a cool scene to watch given how one of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s strong points are its visual designs and cinematic animations. </p><p>You can read more about the game’s strengths and weaknesses in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-steam-game-pass-cyberpunk-elden-ring-1851626674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-steam-game-pass-cyberpunk-elden-ring-1851626674">flew to the top of the Steam Charts</a></span> hours after coming out this week, beating out records set by other single-player games like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.

<p>Game Science has just confirmed that Black Myth: Wukong has sold 10 million copies since its release on August 20. That makes it one of the fastest-selling games in years, and the numbers outside of the overall sales figure represent the rampant popularity of this title. It has topped streaming charts and the player count is breaking records on some platforms.</p>



<p>With 10 million copies old and no sign of slowing down, this monumental title is shaping up to be the talk of the town for quite some time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-10-million-and-counting">10 Million and Counting</h2>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong broke peak player count records on Steam, storming above Counter-Strike and securing the top spot as the most-played single-player game in the platform’s history. It hit almost half a million concurrent viewers on Twitch, but it likely dominated Chinese streaming platforms much more effectively – we just don’t have the numbers at present.</p>



<p>For a while, the game was shaken by a slight scandal that surfaced. It was revealed that Game Science issued ‘guidelines’ to influencers that prohibited them from streaming the game and talking about topics like feminism and COVID-19. This was enough to rile some in the gaming community, but it did nothing to slow down the overall impact of the game. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Some players have reported difficulties beating certain bosses, but that’s the nature of the game. It’s another entry in a long line of ‘soulslike’ games that many refer to as ‘Boss Simulators’. However, the enemies in Black Myth: Wukong are innovative and unique enough to stand apart from the competition, even if the general vibe isn’t too dissimilar from top titles like Elden Ring.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> boss Holly Longdale says Blizzard has learned from its controversial Shadowlands launch, acknowledging the expansion "wasn't enough" and "wasn't the right stuff", admitting the team should have "listened more" to its community.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/warcraft-vp-on-what-blizzard-should-have-done-differently-over-the-game-s-20-years-we-should-have-listened-more/">PC Gamer</a>, Longdale reflected back over World of Warcraft's storied 20 years, partly as a player, and "as a very humble and lucky leader on this team".</p>

<p>"I think we should have listened more to the player base," Longdale said. "I think quite often in earlier times, game design wasn't even a job, really," she said. "It was a bunch of super incredibly passionate geeks figuring out how to make tabletop gaming into 3D. So, I think there was a lot of going on their best instincts."</p>
<p>Acknowledging the changing shape of social media and community management, Longdale said the development team at the time "wasn't really reflective", so the team has learned to "listen more and observe".</p>
<p>"So listening to the community, and being able to verify the discussions - now we have the technology and the data to be able to map those two, "Longdale explained. "Like, whoa, did we really miss something? And then checking to verify that, oh yeah, this is an issue."</p>
<p>Talking specifically about class balancing, she said: "Like, oh, my class is a disaster. And you get a wealth of commentary and support for those ideas, and then you make a change and then it breaks everything else. Balance is a big example.</p>
<p>"It took longer to make [Shadowlands] content than we would've liked. We remained committed to get it out there, but it wasn't enough, and it wasn't the right stuff. And we looked at that very deeply and we still do to use it as guidance for where we're going."</p>
<p>World of Warcraft's new expansion, The War Within, is now available in early access. For everyone else, the long-running MMORPG will launch soon, on 26th August.</p>
<p>Did you know that the entirety of Blizzard's 500-strong World of Warcraft development team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-team-forms-500-stong-union">have unionised</a>, making it the largest group within Microsoft's gaming teams to do so thus far?</p>
<p>Around 1750 employees within Microsoft's gaming teams are now unionised, including those working on Blizzard's veteran MMO.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Valve asks that patrons look out for the Deck icon, to "see how these players reviewed the game". It shared an example of how this icon looks on a review, with a little Deck outline displayed in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Response to this update has been positive, with many other X users sharing their appreciation. Several messages such as "fantastic idea" and "that'll be extremely helpful" have popped up in the replies since Valve made the announcement. </p>
<p>What do you think of this new Steam update?</p>

<p>As for the Steam Deck itself, back in May, Digital Foundry said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-steam-deck-rt-tested-vs-rog-ally">Valve's portable PC had "quietly become a reasonably capable ray tracing handheld"</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Valve-related news, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">hero shooter known as Deadlock</a> and which the company still hasn't actually announced has welcomed quite the number of players over the last few weeks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-mena-hero-project<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced the PlayStation MENA Hero Project, a new incubator program aimed at finding and supporting developers based in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Previous Hero Projects have focused on areas like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-china-hero-project-shows-off-five-upcoming-chinese-indie-games">China</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-india-hero-project">India</a>, but this one focuses on eleven specific countries within the MENA regions, aiming to support companies through "mentorship, training, and project-based investment".</p>
<p>According to Sony, the MENA Hero Project is part of "identifying new and diverse developers worldwide" and showcasing "the most incredible talents" the region has to offer. Looks like we might be about to see a whole lot more games from Middle Eastern and North African developers.</p>

<ul><li>Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>United Arab Emirates</li>
<li>Bahrain</li>
<li>Iraq</li>
<li>Kuwait</li>
<li>Oman</li>
<li>Qatar</li>
<li>Jordan</li>
<li>Egypt</li>
<li>Morocco</li>
<li>Tunisia</li>
</ul><p>If you happen to belong to a studio that's from one of these countries and you want to apply for the PlayStation MENA Hero Project, then you can apparently <a href="https://www.playstation.com/global/mena-hero-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do so via this link</a>.</p>
<p>I should point out that the link doesn't appear to work for me, but that might be because I'm based in the UK, and the link only works for those who are operating from one of the above countries.</p>

<p>Of course, it's also possible that the link is just broken right now and that the page will go live at some point in the near future. If that's the case, you might want to bookmark it so that you can check whether it's working later down the line. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things PlayStation.</p>
