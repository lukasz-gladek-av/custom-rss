            <link>https://kotaku.com/roblox-fall-guys-speedrun-world-record-fraud-2000657154</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A player who goes by Quinten was on their way to securing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174">Guinness World Record in Roblox</a> when they were beat out at the last moment by multiple speedruns that were so good, they seemed humanly impossible. A lesser player might have gone back to gambling on the Roblox ponies, but Quinten instead set out to prove that the new records were bogus. It worked.</p> <p>As <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/roblox/guiness-world-record-cheat">PCGamesN</a></em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/roblox/guiness-world-record-cheat"> reports,</a>&nbsp;Quinten was competing for the world record in a Roblox game called <em>Ultimate Easy Obby</em> that has <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/10760024537/Ultimate-Easy-Obby">over 100,000 reviews</a>. It’s a zany, single-player obstacle course similar to something you might find in <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-s-a-new-type-of-fall-guys-jackass-1846537028"><em>Fall Guys</em></a> and was published by Roblox in partnership with the Guinness World Record company. Last month, Quinten secured a time of 05:48:96 following an “insane back-and-forth battle” with another Roblox speedrunner. It was the result of tons of time spent “optimizing every corner and jump,” the 18-year-old Belgian wrote on Reddit.</p>

 <p>But then something bizarre happened. Quinten’s speedrun record was quickly beaten by three other random Roblox accounts. And not just by a little bit but six whole seconds. “For context: a 6-second gap on a speedrun this optimized is physically impossible,” they wrote. “It was heartbreaking to see a week of grinding ruined by scripts.” Undeterred, Quinten decided to speedrun an investigation into the mysterious rivals to find proof of the suspected cheating.</p>

  <p>This evidence fell into three main buckets. The first was bogus time stamps. <em>Ultimate Easy Obby</em> features a linear obstacle course consisting of 50 stages, but some of the mystery accounts’ timestamps were out of order. The new world record holder was also missing a “digital receipt” of ever having actually completed the race. “This proved he never actually touched the finish line trigger; he likely teleported a coordinate script to the end-game lobby, bypassing the verification check,” Quinten wrote.</p>

 <p>But the real nail in the coffin was painstaking frame-by-frame analysis of Quinten’s own best recorded time to show that shaving six seconds off it would be impossible. “I took my best run and calculated the theoretical maximum time save possible (perfect pixels, zero drag),” they wrote. “Even with a TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) level of perfection, the times the cheaters posted were mathematically impossible within the game’s physics engine.”</p>

 <p>Surprisingly, it all worked. The evidence was submitted to Guinness which then went back, reviewed the records, and re-validated Quinten’s as the true World Record. “It felt amazing to successfully lobby a major organization to reverse verified records based on user-submitted digital forensics,” they wrote. The king of <em>Ultimate Easy Obby&nbsp;</em>can once again rest easy knowing at least one more small sliver of fraud has been carved out of Roblox.</p>

<p>That gives those individual pixels time to fully transition from one color to the next before they’re illuminated, meaning viewers don’t perceive those pixels fading from one color as they do on a traditional G-Sync monitor. It also means those old pixels don’t persist as long on the viewer’s retina, increasing the “apparent refresh rate” above the monitor’s actual refresh rate, according to Nvidia.</p>

<p>Similar “Ultra Low Motion Blur” features on other pulsing backlight monitors <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-sync-ultra-low-motion-blur-2/">have existed for a while</a>, but they only worked at fixed refresh rates. Pulsar monitors differentiate themselves by syncing the pulses with the variable refresh rate of a G-Sync monitor, offering what Nvidia calls a combination of “tear free frames and incredible motion clarity.”</p>
<p>Independent testers have had more varied impressions of the visual impact of the Pulsar. The Monitors Unboxed YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXwXGYhi8_I">called it</a> “clearly the best solution currently available” for limiting motion blur and “the first version of this technology that I would genuinely consider using on a regular basis.” PC Magazine, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-hopes-to-banish-a-form-of-motion-blur-thats-plague-pc-gaming-for-years/">said</a> the Pulsar improvements are “minor in the grand scheme of things” and would be hard to notice for a casual viewer.</p>

                <p>Highlighting an ongoing trend, the most popular games on PlayStation and Xbox are multiplayer, online, live-service titles that aren't necessarily "new," at least not in the traditional sense.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that 2025's top five most-played games for PlayStation and Xbox in the US were the same as 2024's, and in the case of PS5, the ranking was exactly the same.</p><p>On PS5, the top five most-played games in the US were Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA V, Roblox, and Minecraft, ranked in that order. That was the same as 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, which is ranked by an "active panel" of players.</p><p>On Xbox, the top five most-played games for 2025 in the US in order were Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA V, Minecraft, and Roblox. For 2024, the ranking went Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, GTA V, and then Roblox.</p><p>Call of Duty's inclusion in the ranking is buoyed by the fact that multiple games are lumped into one single launcher. Currently, the launcher--COD HQ--includes the newest game, Black Ops 7, as well as last year's Black Ops 6, along with the free-to-play juggernaut Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Piscatella said the takeaway here is that, "Things are a bit established at the top."</p><p>This report followed on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/60-of-all-playtime-in-2023-was-spent-on-live-service-games-more-than-six-years-old/1100-6522366/" data-ref-id="1100-6522366">Newzoo study from 2024</a> that showed how 60% of playtime in games for games in 2023 were attributable to games more than five years old, including Fortnite, GTA V, Call of Duty, Roblox, and Minecraft.</p><p>Some have referred to these titles as "black hole" games because they suck up time, attention, and money to a significant degree, making it challenging for newcomers to find success.</p><p>Games like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox may not be "new," but they are live-service games that receive new content on a regular basis, creating opportunities for people to keep coming back to play and spend money.

            <p>The Duffer brothers, creators of Stranger Things, have said the final battle of the TV series was partially inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. Matt Duffer was apparently playing the game while devising the showdown.</p>
<p>Note: there are spoilers for the final battle ahead.</p>
<p>"We were thinking about D&amp;D and I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 at the time," <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/">Duffer told Variety</a>, "and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat [the mind flayer] was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realised — either through self-acceptance or they've resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they're absolutely primed. They're the ultimate team, and it's the party working all together to defeat this thing.</p>
<p>"And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that's where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons and something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>. Because that's how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle."</p><p>The final battle of Stranger Things pits nearly the entire cast of goodies against a colossal spidery crab monster in the wasteland of Dimension X. This is the physical manifestation of the shadowy mind flayer we see repeatedly through the series, and which Henry Creel, AKA Vecna, partners with - he takes up residence literally inside the beast.</p>
<p>Links to Baldur's Gate 3 are to be expected of course, with both entertainment properties being heavily rooted in, or based upon, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and both revolving around a mind flayer plot. In Stranger Things it's more euphemistic, however, used as a kind of lingo the central characters - the kids - apply to strange enemies they face. In BG3 you face an actual mind flayer threat, coincidentally also having to destroy the mega-mind controlling it (which isn't a giant spidery crab).</p>
<p>Whether Matt Duffer played Baldur's Gate 3 for inspiration or for entertainment purposes is unclear - the interview doesn't touch upon it - but I expect it's a bit of both. The Duffer brothers have said before that they aren't, despite appearances, long-serving D&amp;D fans - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXSsXbFfwXU">they didn't grow up playing it</a>. Perhaps BG3 was a more approachable way into learning the game.</p>
<p>Matt Duffer also didn't clarify which other video game references were in the final Stranger Things battle, though if you ask me, that mind flayer spider crab thing looks a lot like a corpser from the Gears of War series. It being a giant enemy crab also brings to mind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-genjidaysofblade-ps3">Sony's infamous 'giant enemy crab' meme from Genji: Days of the Blade</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, on <strong>9th January 2025</strong> (this Friday), <strong>South Park</strong> will enter the fray, though no specific details as to what this might entail have been shared at the time of writing.</p>
<p>All we've got for the time being is a small teaser via social media:</p>

<p>It wouldn't be a new Fortnite drop without a few leaks, mind you, and word on the street is that the content will include skins for Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, along with items relating to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/south_park_the_stick_of_truth">The Stick of Truth</a>. There may also be some South Park-themed environments, which would honestly be awesome.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if the leaks are accurate, but we're intrigued to see exactly how this pans out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jtzvkm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

			<p>The air at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/">CES 2026</a></strong> is sure to feel a lot different from that in previous years. <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-sparks-backlash-after-firing-hundreds-of-ai-workers-amid-disputes-over-poor-pay-stressful-work-and-labor-rights/">Not just because of mass layoffs</a>, or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/satya-nadella-admits-transition-into-the-ai-era-could-be-messy-but-does-not-want-microsoft-to-be-left-behind-in-the-tech-race/">continued GenAI/AI push</a> from nearly every major tech company. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wd_black-sn850x-8tb-ssd-heatsink-version-14-percent-off-on-amazon-available-for-829-99/">The memory shortage looms over everything</a>, and its impact will continue to be felt worldwide, with prices likely to rise on all the products showcased in Las Vegas this year. It was pretty much all I could think about back on December 9, 2025, when ASUS invited Wccftech and other members of the media to a preview of what the company would be showing at CES 2026 in downtown Toronto.</p>



<p>There was a lot I got to see that day, and a few things that stood out. If you want to see what those were, you can check out my highlights round-up, which will be live soon.</p>



<p>It was intriguing to see what ASUS was putting forward for the new year, but it was difficult to look at anything with a significant level of excitement. With the way prices are going, when buying anything from the latest 2026 lineup of tech products, you're either getting burned by overpaying now at launch, or you're burned even more by overpaying later if the shortage issues don't improve soon. Pricing was such a significant factor that when I got the chance to sit down and talk with Sascha Krohn, global director of technical marketing at ASUS, it was the first thing I wanted to address.</p>



<p>This was the second time this year I got to speak with Mr. Krohn, after first meeting him in October ahead of the launch for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">You can check out that conversation if you like here</a>, and while we did get to the new handheld, and other elements of ASUS's CES 2026 lineup, the company's AI messaging, and more, we began with what was, and what continues to be the topic of the day.</p>



<p><strong>We're hearing a lot about memory shortages lately. How much is this affecting ASUS on the manufacturing side, and are there certain products where you're feeling the pressure more than others?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sascha Krohn</strong>: <em>Yeah, I don't actually have any detailed insights into how we deal with our suppliers and how we allocate memory, but basically the way it happens is when you plan out a new product, whether it's a laptop or a handheld, you do have a forecast for how many you think you're going to sell over the lifetime of this product and how much per month, and then you do deals with suppliers. 'I'm going to need this many panels in this month and this month and this quarter,' and so on, and you kind of come to an agreement and make a deal about how much memory, how many panels you're going to buy.</em></p>



<p><em>So to some degree, that helps to shield vendors from sudden changes in prices for components, but there's always wiggle room, right? You never know exactly how many you're going to sell, and you usually make like a deal for a certain quantity, but you're probably going to need more, and then you just buy it, make additional deals later. I'm not really an expert in this, so I don't want to go into too much detail, but I do know that we usually make these kinds of plans ahead of time, which kind of shields us to some degree, but yeah, it is going to affect us for sure. And I know that some of our competitors have already announced that they're increasing prices.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-Zephyrus-DUO-2026-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><em>I believe everybody's going to have to increase prices</em></strong>.<em> I think everything that has memory chips in it and flash memory chips in it is going to go up in price to some degree. How much is going to vary, but everything is going to increase in price, like consoles, phones, tablets. I think that's just inevitable, and I think most people haven't realized it because we all saw the news that memory chips went up in price, but then you see, 'oh, but there's still really good deals on laptops and gaming consoles and everything, and it hasn't really changed all that much.' That's because it takes several months until that shockwave travels through the supply chain and hits all the manufacturers and hits all the retailers and e-tailers. So that is probably still going to happen.</em></p>



<p><em>So yeah, I think it's going to affect everyone, but most companies are not talking about it for obvious reasons. I'm actually surprised that some of our competitors went out and announced it. I don't know why they did that.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is ASUS going to announce price increases soon? Are you expecting price changes on GPUs, laptops, or any of your product line?</strong></p>



<p><em>I haven't heard anything about this internally, so that would be something that would be, like, an official statement that travels through the company, and then we hear about it, and then we communicate it. I haven't heard anything about that, but me personally, yes, I do expect that to happen.</em></p>

</blockquote>



<p><strong>Have you been given a potential warning from other companies like NVIDIA that prices are going to go up for products that you collaborate on?</strong></p>



<p><em>I haven't heard anything about that, but if that happened, it would not be something that I would hear about right away, so, yeah, I haven't heard anything about that.</em></p>



<p><strong>Okay, but prices will be rising across the board?</strong></p>



<p><em>That's what I personally think. That's not, like, an official company statement, but me personally, yes, based on my experience, you know, in the tech industry and based on what's happening right now, that's what I assume, yeah.</em></p>



<p><strong>Do you think prices will stabilize soon? How long do you think it will take for them to stabilize?</strong></p>



<p><em>I've been telling all my friends all the really good deals that happened lately for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that's probably the best deals that they'll be able to get for a while. I don't know how long it's going to take. Like, I'm not an expert in this kind of stuff, but I do think it's going to take a while until prices stabilize overall.</em></p>



<p><em>I mean, just like geopolitics, right? The world is overall, you know, going in a certain direction, and, yeah, I expect that prices are going to at least stay elevated.</em></p>



<p><strong>What's 'a while?'</strong></p>



<p><em>I really don't know. I mean, I could only guess, and I don't want to get into trouble for guessing something.</em></p>



<p><strong>How has the launch of the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X been? Are you meeting expectations sales-wise, and can you share a global estimate of how many units of the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X have been sold?</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ROG-Xbox-Ally.Ally-X.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. Image credit: Xbox</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>That's an easy question for me because I don't have sales figures, so I don't know. But I can tell you that the reception has been overwhelmingly positive. People really love the ROG Xbox Ally X in particular, which I expected, and I'm not surprised about it at all. I actually think it was a really good and still is a really good price.</em></p>



<p><em>And I think the ROG Xbox Ally X even sold out in a couple of places, yeah? The demand for the ROG Xbox Ally X is much higher than we as a company anticipated. I personally, from the beginning, was like, this one is going to sell really well because there are a lot of people from the original Ally X who want to upgrade, and they're going to upgrade to the ROG Xbox Ally X.</em></p>



<p><strong>I wanted to ask about this tagline here, 'AI: Always Incredible.' What made you land on this for your new line of AI products?</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ASUS-Always-Incredible.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Well, 'Incredible' is kind of like a word that our top management likes to use and we've used a lot over the years. We picked that because it's, you know, together, when you use the two letters, it's AI, always incredible. And that's kind of like our strategy for AI. We want to get to the point that no matter what you're doing, whether it's on device or cloud or on the edge, like in between, you have a great AI experience no matter what you're doing.</em></p>



<p><em>And we want to make it as seamless and as convenient as possible. The ultimate goal is very much like our Zen book. The idea is that technology just gets out of the way.</em> <em>There are a lot of concerns about AI and some people are really worried about AI and don't like AI. </em></p>



<p><em>And there's a lot of annoying stuff that is related to AI, but we also see it as a great enabler to make that happen, right? To get technology out of the way. Like this whole thing, I think there's this saying that magic is technology that you don't even notice that you're interacting with</em>,<em> or something like that, you know? And that's kind of, it feels like magic.</em></p>



<p><em>When technology works the way it should, it feels like magic. It just works, and it's seamless. You don't have to think about it, and you don't have to figure out how to do it. You don't have to learn how to tell your technology what you want, but your technology figures out what you want and does what you want. And AI has the biggest potential to make that a reality for a lot of cool features. So we are very excited about that as a company, and we're leaning very heavily into that, into trying to work on as many AI solutions as possible and use AI to make everything as seamless as possible.</em></p>



<p><strong>What do you think people should be taking away from the 2026 lineup of ASUS products? What is the best thing that ASUS is bringing to the market this year?</strong></p>



<p><em>Oof, only one? I would say the ZenBook Duo. I think the ZenBook Duo 2026. I would pick the ZenBook Duo 2026 because it's so refined, it's so much better than the ZenBook Duo 2025, which is an awesome laptop and we're still gonna sell it throughout the whole year. But the 2026 is so much more refined, lighter, longer battery life, more performance, better displays. It's so much easier to set up.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Shot_019_Zenbook_DUO_Theme_Photo_AC_101-group-1-kopie_72dpi-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>You have the two displays so close to each other now. Yeah, I think that's very refined, and it's also very ASUS. I'm a big fan of the ZenBook Duo because I think for us as a company, what separates us from other brands is that we don't have such a big risk aversion.</em></p>



<p><em>We're willing to try out things even if there's a high chance that it's not going to work out. And ZenBook Duo is a perfect example. Every once in a while, or there's a pretty big number, a pretty high percentage, it does work out, and we end up with something really cool, and then we keep refining it, and it ends up being this really unique product, and there's nothing else like it on the market.</em></p>



<p><em>And we kind of created the Duo segment, and we own that segment, and there are other companies trying to enter that segment, and they're failing; it doesn't really work. So I think, yeah, the ZenBook Duo 2026 is like a perfect example of ASUS doing new things, being innovative, refining things and listening to customer feedback and creating products that people want that are maybe not for everyone but there are a lot of people who really want a product like this and they benefit from a product like this and most companies wouldn't do it because it's not something that everybody's going to buy. You're not going to sell the highest number of devices.</em></p>



<p><em>It's not going to be a device like that. So if you only care about profits and you only care about market share, this is not necessarily something you do, but it's something that ASUS does, and I think, yeah, ZenBook Duo 2026.</em></p>



<p><strong>I would definitely agree that there are more than a few products ASUS make that are not things that everyone would do. The G1000, I think, falls into that same category. I heard outside that you can't buy the chassis separately and then build your own PC inside?</strong></p>



<p><em>Yes.</em></p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p><em>Well, the way we created this desktop was, okay, we want to make ready-made gaming desktops that are appealing to people, which is challenging because we are working with some awesome partners who are building systems like that already using our components, because we also have motherboards, VGAs and all these components. You can already build that.</em></p>



<p><em>Either there's a big community of just end users who build those systems themselves, PC DIY, and there are system integrators, great partners we have, that build systems for people who just want to buy a ready-made system. So how do we compete with that? We don't really want to compete with it. We want to add something else to it.</em></p>



<p><em>We want to bring something new to the market that is different, right? So we were thinking about how we can make a ready-made desktop that isn't something that's directly competing with people building their own PC or people buying something from a system integrator. And that's what we came up with. We can do a different kind of case design that has a new way of doing system cooling, a better way of doing system cooling, and we wanted to do something that allows people to customize in a way that isn't possible right now. And that's kind of how we came up with the G1000 with the NME Holo and with the thermal atrium at the top for the all-in-one water cooler for the CPU.</em></p>

<p><em>So that's kind of the whole idea behind it. If we were to sell that as a case, it would kind of defeat the purpose. I'm not saying we would never do it, but I don't think that's the plan right now.</em></p>



<p><strong>For the Zephyrus line, ASUS has two 2026 models. They're both on Intel now and not AMD, save for the third, hybrid 2025-2026 model. Where did the idea for the hybrid come from? Why keep the 2025 chassis and stick with AMD, and what prompted the move to Intel for the other two models?</strong></p>



<p><em>The switch to Intel for 2026, it's basically every time we come up with new devices, we think about 'what's our strategy,' what's our direction, what do we want to do with this device and in which direction do we want to go? Do we want to go for more performance, or longer battery life? What's our strategy? And then we look at our silicon partners, what is their strategy, and what chips do they have available, right? Then, usually, stuff just very naturally evolves in, 'okay, there's going to be a chip that has this certain power envelope and certain performance and battery life focus, and this pretty much aligns with what we want to do for this chassis or for this device.'</em></p>



<p><em>And then we naturally just work together on having this silicon in this kind of device. But there is also a part of just strategy, where you also have to look into what's the supply situation and who's giving us a good deal and who's maybe easy to work with and can guarantee us a certain supply or a certain price point or something like that. It all plays into it together. I think in the end, it was a decision made by both sides that it just makes sense to go for Panzer Lake with G14 and G16.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Zephyrus-G14-GA403-Scenario-Rendering_01-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>For the 2025 chassis refresh with an AMD 2026 CPU, I don't know the story behind it, to be honest. I suspect that there was a demand for it, that there was interest from our sales to have that configuration for that price point.</em></p>



<p><em>I know that people are into conspiracy theories, and it's crazy the kind of mind gymnastics some people do to come up with super complex theory to explain something that is pretty straightforward. Most of the time, it is boring, but the pretty straightforward part is: why are we doing something? It's usually because people want to buy it. It's boring, but that's usually the answer.</em></p>



<p><strong>How did the collaboration with Kojima Productions come about? How did that process go, did you work directly with Hideo Kojima and Yoji Shinkawa?</strong></p>



<p><em>I wish I knew more about it, I don't know all the backstory and all the details. Yes we worked on them directly with this, and yes the design is by both Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima. This is not something we did and proposed, and then they approved it like, 'Yeah this kind of looks like what we do.' This is a design from them and we worked very closely with them, but the exact process...I think that we approached them, but I don't actually know for sure. For these kind of collaborations, it's usually us approaching different artists we would like to collaborate with, and then we see how we could work together.</em></p>

As the Bob Dylan song goes, how many lush alien planets must a Man presumptuously land on and turn into poorly optimised Toyota plants before he finally decides he’s sick of being an extractivist piece of shit? Dylan was being rhetorical, but I studied at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY3fqF6-jyE">the school of Homer Simpson</a>, and want you to give me an actual figure. I’m going to say: four and a half. If you’ve yet to hit your personal quota, well, here’s StarRupture <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">out now in early access</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a> with more of a four-player shoot-me-do element, and scenes from the battlements that recall Michael Ironside’s last stand in Starship Troopers. It’s from the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/green-hell">Green Hell</a>, of which Nic (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/green-hell-review">wrote the following</a> back in 2019: “most of what held my attention about Green Hell was how dazzlingly beautiful and technically impressive it was, but the more traditional survival elements are all solid enough that I look forward to playing more”. History is silent as to whether Nic did, in fact, play more. That’s the last thing RPS ever published about Green Hell, actually. Ominous.
</p>
<p>
The pitch for StarRupture: you and your scalliwag convict friends have been sent to a strange new world racked by violent changes of temperature. You owe intergalactic society a debt of exotic ore, and naturally, you have a feminine chatbot overseer who is given to snarky corporate slogans. And That’s The Approximately Satirical Sci-Fi Survival Base Builder Guarantee!

Local organisms include many, many skittering bug creatures, who swarm your outposts periodically to have a conversation with your turrets about where best to explode into goo. Fortress aside, you’ll be covering your surroundings with solar panels, conveyor belts and 3D printers. Deeper in, there are narrative mysteries to uncover by, one assumes, going into the caves or ruins or whatever and blasting more/larger insects.
</p><p>
The early access build includes “the majority of gameplay mechanics we’re planning for the full release to be polished and ready to enjoy,” devs Creepy Jar observe, including “an up-to-4-player co-operation mode in which you will be able to build, fight and explore a vast part of our rich open world”. The full release “is planned to contain more biomes, enemies, buildings and mechanics, along with a compelling endgame”.

I realise I sound vaguely like this game ran over my toe while riding one of those heavier, vintage tricycles - the kind with proper metal frames. Some sugar: within its carefully delimited and soulless horizons, this seems promising enough. It makes me want Arrowhead to put base-building in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. If you’d rather learn the ultimate fate of Green Hell, it’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/815370/Green_Hell/">90% off on Steam</a> at the time of writing.

              <p>While the first two games added to Xbox Game Pass in January might not knock your socks off, it’s what’s coming later this month that should bring some New Year cheer. By January 13, Game Pass subscribers will have access to Ubisoft’s enormously underrated <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and just a week later the stunning&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em> brings our favorite tall lady to the service.</p> <p>Added today, January 6, are drunken twin-stick shooter <em>Brews &amp; Bastards&nbsp;</em>(no, me neither, but I’ll be installing it this evening) and <em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition.&nbsp;</em>Then as soon as tomorrow, last year’s underdog first-person action game <em>Atomfall</em> will be added to the subscription platform, alongside 2025 roguelite sequel <em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, online multiplayer soccer sim&nbsp;<em>Rematch</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Master Crafted Edition</em>, hopefully now fixed <a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318">from all its many issues on launch</a>.</p>

 <p>Then, but another day later, we get the original&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em> in its 2024 “remodeled” version, seemingly plucked from the&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-xbox-tokyo-game-show-1851658451"><em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-xbox-tokyo-game-show-1851658451"> bundle</a>.</p> <p>You’ll have to somehow wait another five days, until January 13, before the next update, when <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> arrives, and hopefully a whole new raft of people can discover this fantastic open-galaxy criminal ’em up, after it suffered from both a buggy launch and a concerted anti-woke campaign from the worst people on the internet. Seriously, if you were put off by any of the noise during its 2024 release, this is a great chance to put that right. The stealth is&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>much better now.</p>

 <p>After&nbsp;<em>My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery</em> shows up Jan 15, on the 20th arrives <a href="https://kotaku.com/ikumi-nakamura-sentenced-to-horny-jail-for-lady-dimit-1846919932">Lady Dimitrescu</a> in her size 25s via 2021’s <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, alongside metroidvania platformer <em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em>, a day-one release.</p> <p>Microsoft giveth, but Microsoft taketh away, so to get all these new games we must sacrifice a bunch too. I don’t imagine too many tears will be shed over the five titles going away on January 15, however, all listed below. Here’s everything in one handy, bullet-pointed list:</p> <h2>January 6</h2> <ul> <li><em>Brews &amp; Bastards</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</em> (Cloud, Handheld, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 7</h2> <ul> <li><em>Atomfall</em> (Cloud, Console, Handheld, PC)</li> <li><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em> (Cloud, Xbox Series, Handheld, PC)</li> <li><em>Rematch</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 8</h2> <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy</em> (Cloud, Xbox Series, PC)</li> </ul> <h2>January 15</h2> <ul> <li><em>My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, PC)</li> </ul> <h2>January 20</h2> <p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> (Cloud, Console, PC)</p> <p><em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em> (Cloud, Handheld, PC, Xbox Series)</p> <h2>Leaving January 15</h2> <ul> <li><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn </em>(Cloud, Handheld, PC, and Xbox Series X|S)</li> <li><em>Neon White&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>The Ascent&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>The Grinch Christmas Adventures&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> </ul>

<p>From <strong>Tarsier Studios</strong>, the twisted minds behind the first two <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ship-of-horrors/">Little Nightmares</a></em></strong> titles, comes <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong>, a spiritual successor to the series, sporting a new setting and a <strong>co-op focus</strong> that aims to make the experience more engaging.</p>



<p>This horror adventure follows a brother and sister on a harrowing journey through a <strong>hellish, grotesque landscape</strong> to rescue their missing friends. <a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/"><strong>Retaining the signature "grotesque beauty" of Tarsier’s previous work</strong></a>, <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong> takes everything up to eleven in terms of scale and creature designs, offering an experience that promises to be as <strong>unnerving</strong> as it will be to play.</p>

<p>Although fairly niche compared to series like <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> and <strong><em>Silent Hill</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Fatal Frame</em></strong> franchise is widely appreciated by survival horror fans thanks to its <strong>marked Japanese feel</strong>. And in <strong>2026</strong>, both newcomers and veterans of the franchise will be able to experience the <strong>second entry in the series like never before</strong>.</p>



<p>Developed with involvement from <strong>Team NINJA</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><strong>which is also launching <em>Nioh 3</em> this year</strong></a>), <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> brings the tragic story of twin sisters <strong>Mio and Mayu</strong> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake-release-date-march-2026-ps5/"><strong>modern hardware</strong></a> with <strong>improved visuals</strong>, <strong>overhauled lighting</strong> and <strong>new gameplay features</strong>, such as the <strong>"Hold Hands"</strong> mechanics that use the sisters' bond to restore health and spirit power, adding a <strong>tactile layer</strong> to the exploration of the cursed <strong>Minakami Village</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Are you looking forward to first-party PlayStation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>? Ever wanted a game to just play itself, while you put the controller down and just watch the trophies roll in? If you hear that and wonder, 'Well, what's the point of playing the game in the first place?' then you're having the same reaction to Sony's new 'AI-generated Ghost Player' patent that most of the internet seems to be having. If you think that sounds like a great way to enjoy a game, then this patent seems to be made specifically for you.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">published the filing publicly this week</a> after it was initially filed by Sony back in September 2024. The patent describes a "<em>ghost player</em>" appearing as an "<em>overlay</em>" to show the player how to complete a section of the game they're having trouble with. </p>



<p>"<em>During live gameplay by a player, game state data is analyzed in order to identify a scenario occurring in the context of the gameplay of the player. The scenario occurring during the live gameplay can then be processed by the Al model and an assistance Al engine in order to provide a ghost character with control inputs for animation/control to guiding the player in relevant interactivity of the game</em>," the filing reads. "<em>The relevant interactivity is for the context of the gameplay of the player, not just some prior gameplay of another player. The ghost character can therefore be controlled by the assistance Al engine during gameplay and provide the player with visual illustrations of how certain game scenarios are played in order for the character controlled by the player to be able to achieve progress in the game.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sony-AI-Generated-Ghost-Player-Patent.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: WIPO</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The filing also describes different modes for players to pick from. The 'Guide Mode' would show you the solution to whatever is troubling you in the game you're playing, like a puzzle in Uncharted or God of War. Whereas 'Complete Mode' would just do it for you, so you can move progress further in the game and not have to deal with that section.</p>



<p>Sony already has help systems built into the PS5's console software, with its Tips and Game Help system that lets players get increasingly more detailed hints as to how they complete a section of the game, with the most detailed hint simply telling the player what they need to do. It only works when developers opt into including those hints, but when they're there, they can be helpful to players who don't want to reach for their phone or laptop to look up a guide.</p>



<p>Players already complain when NPC allies give you the answer to a puzzle before you've had the chance to solve it yourself. It doesn't sound like this AI-generated Ghost Player would jump the gun and show you a solution before you ask for one, but going as far as to beat the section for you seems like a stretch too far for anyone who actually wants to enjoy the games they buy.</p>



<p>Of course, it is just a patent, so we may never see this actually implemented. But based on the reaction players had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Microsoft's Gaming Copilot</a> introduction last year, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">even the idea that an AI is helping you and watching you play</a>, this doesn't seem like the kind of thing players want to have available to them.</p>



<p>You can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/">look up a handy guide</a>, or, of course, just try and figure it out for yourself. No one likes getting frustrated when playing a game, and getting stuck is not a good feeling. Sometimes that frustration is what makes you stop playing a game entirely. But where's the fun in watching the game play itself?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced what kind of PC specs you're going to need if you want to run the upcoming <em>007 First Light</em>, but there's something pretty obvious missing from its rundown.</p><p>You can see the official PC specs <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/news?panel=https%3A%2F%2Fioi.dk%2F007firstlightgame%2Fnews%2F2026%2F007-first-light-unveils-pc-specs-and-nvidia-collaboration" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">over on IO's website</a>, where you'll find a measly two presets, namely Minimum and Recommended. Notably, both appear to be targeting 1080p as their resolution and don't feature any tips on what you might need to get stable performance at 1440p or 4K.</p><p>Naturally, that doesn't mean your rig won't be able to handle <em>007 First Light </em>at higher resolutions (or, indeed, higher frame rates than 60fps), but it is a little strange that IO Interactive wouldn't include this information in its infographic.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Thankfully, it looks like if you do want to run <em>007 First Light </em>at 1080p and maintain a stable 60fps, you won't need too beefy a rig to do so. Here are the two presets IO has announced for the game. Both require 64-bit installations of either Windows 10 or 11.</p><h3>Minimum (1080p at 30fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660, AMD Radeon RX 5700, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 16GB</li><li>VRAM: 8GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul><h3>Recommended (1080p at 60fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-13500 or AMD Ryzen 5 7600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 32GB</li><li>VRAM: 12GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>007 First Light</em>, it's a stealthy action-adventure game from IO Interactive, the folks behind the <em>Hitman </em>series, and you can expect a similar blend of sneaking and high-octane thrills from the game.</p><p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2642ca01-5e15-44ba-9ed9-26d9d752f67a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">slated for a March launch</a>, <em>007 First Light </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed to May</a> just before Christmas, possibly in response to Rockstar revealing that industry powerhouse <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">would be moved from May to November</a>.</p><p>When it does arrive, <em>007 First Light </em>will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768760/007_First_Light/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/007-first-light/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/007-first-light/9PN198B459VB" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/007-First-Light-2792136.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

                <p>A lot of interesting technology has been revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week, but one of the strangest might be Razer's Project Ava, an AI-powered desktop companion. Razer envisions the device as a "dynamic personality" that can interact with its owners as a 3D hologram, and it'll have several animated personalities to choose from, including one based on the prominent League of Legends esports player, Faker.</p><p>Razer claims that Ava uses human-like vision and audio-sensing for full contextual awareness, and that it can converse with people, consult on work tasks, and motivate you to engage in self-care routines. The company says it can also assist you in your work with "two-way conversation" features, and for gaming, it can fulfill multiple roles and deliver real-time hype.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QDthx_WjwE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_QDthx_WjwE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for the other personalities, Ava's default personality is a fusion of HAL 9000 and the original Xbox boot-up screen, Kira is an anime waifu, Zane is designed to be your gaming wingman, and Sao looks like she's ready for a day at the office. Razer says these characters are rendered in real time on a 5.5-inch holographic display and feature "high-fidelity motion, eye-tracking, and facial expressions" to help them engage with users.</p><p>Project Ava currently uses xAI's controversial Grok engine, but Razer says it will be compatible with other leading AI platforms in the future. The physical design incorporates multiple technologies, such as dual Far-Field array mics, an HD camera with an ambient light sensor, and RGB lighting, since this is a Razer product.</p><p>Project Ava is designed for Windows users and requires a direct connection to a PC via a USB-C cable to ensure high-bandwidth data transfers. Razer is aiming to launch Project Ava in the second half of 2026, but pricing has not yet been revealed.</p><p>For more from CES 2026, you can also check out the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-enters-extended-reality-with-240hz-gaming-glasses/1100-6537195/">240Hz XR gaming glasses from Asus</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyperx-reveals-non-invasive-neurotech-gaming-headset-whatever-that-means/1100-6537201/">"non-invasive" brain-scanning headset concept</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-modular-xbox-pc-controller-revealed-releases-this-summer/1100-6537181/">8BitDo's high-end Ultimate 3E gaming controller</a>.</p>

                <p>CES 2026 has officially begun, and Razer is using this year's showcase to reveal a slew of AI-powered gadgets. One of the most intriguing debuts is <a href="https://www.razer.com/concepts/project-motoko" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Motoko</a>, an AI headset powered by Snapdragon. Equipped with a pair of cameras near each earcup, it's capable of analyzing your surroundings and giving you audio feedback on what it sees.</p><p>Razer says Project Motoko can provide all sorts of feedback to users. For example, it can be used while gaming to get feedback about a boss fight, detecting what's on the screen and giving you immediate tips. It can translate street signs when traveling abroad, summarize documents, or handle tasks as simple as counting your reps at the gym. Equipped with dual far- and near-field microphones, it can both pick up your voice commands and listen to your surroundings for environmental cues, ensuring it gives you as accurate a response as possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630479"></a><figcaption>Razer Motoko Headset</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Motoko is built to connect seamlessly with most AI platforms, including OpenAI, Grok, and Gemini. It can also be used for machine learning, passively gathering data to improve the technology as the device is worn.</p><p>It's worth noting, however, that this is a fully auditory system for the user. Unlike smart glasses, which sometimes offer in-lens visual feedback, Motoko looks like your standard headset. So while it has the size to pack in impressive audio and could potentially offer a longer battery life, you won't get any visual responses from the AI.</p><p>Project Motoko does not yet have a release date. Razer says this is currently a "concept," offering folks a "glimpse into the future of AI-driven wearables."

            <p>The top five games played on the PlayStation in 2025 by US players were exactly the same as in 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker.</p>
<p>This information, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">published on social media by senior director at Circana Mat Piscatella</a>, states that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> took the top spot in 2025, followed by Call of Duty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, then Minecraft. This is interesting as this list is an exact replication of the top five games played on US PlayStations in 2024.</p>
<p>Looking at the top five games played on US Xbox's in 2025, there's a slight different in the order of the games which take the top five spots, but the games themselves remain the same. In 2025, Fortnite took the number one spot, followed by Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, and Roblox. Whereas in 2024, Call of Duty was number one, followed by Fortnite, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, then Roblox at number five.</p>

<p>It's safe to say that, judging by these stats, the upper echelon of popular games right now are somewhat cemented in place right now. With the biggest live service games bringing in absurd profit and player engagement metrics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">it's a tricky task to break into the space and survive</a> let alone thrive. A year after its launch, <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20696836/epic-apple-trial-epic-games-exhibit.pdf">Fortnite made over $5bn,</a> and has shown little sign of slowing down ever since.</p><p>That should provide some context as to why developers keep attempting to make big live service hits, as if they can catch on the potential profits are staggering. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders would be an example of this going well</a>, while examples of these sorts of games not catching on are far more numerous. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-big-team-pvp-warhaven-announces-closure-just-4-months-after-its-early-access-launch">Just look at Warhaven</a>, which shut down only four months after its early access release.</p><p>

Will 2026's top five list be different? Even with Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">having hit a bit of a roadbump with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> performing exceptionally well, it's likely the top five list itself will stay very similar. If <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Grand Theft Auto VI wasn't delayed to November</a> perhaps we'd have seen a passing of the torch to the sequel, but oh well.

<p>Pre-orders open this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d9f185e3e0605"><a title="Capcom Arcade Stadium LRG Physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9f185e3e0605/capcom-arcade-stadium-lrg-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/round-up-limited-run-games-10th-anniversary-special-every-switch-announcement-and-physical">10th anniversary special presentation</a>, Limited Run Games announced that it was teaming up with Capcom on a line of physical releases. One of the titles falling in this physical line-up was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">Capcom Arcade Stadium</a>, which had a vague '2026' release date attached. Well, with the new year finally upon us, we've got some more information on what the physical will have in store.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the collection will go live on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/switch-limited-run-300-capcom-arcade-stadium-vol-1">Limited Run website</a> on <strong>9th January 2026</strong> for <strong>$59.99</strong>, but all those who want to get their hands on a copy will have a big decision to make: which cover do you want to see on your shelf?</p>
<p>Limited Run Games is showcasing a whopping <em>five</em> different covers for this physical release. There's one with all of the standard collection key art, but the other four feature new pieces of artwork for individual games featured in the collection: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/ghouls_n_ghosts">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/captain_commando">Captain Commando</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/final_fight">Final Fight</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/strider">Strider</a>.</p>
<p>The actual boxed contents remain the same, obviously, and each cover will sell for the same price, but it's a pretty tough decision. Here's a closer look at each design, so you can see for yourself:</p>


<p>Pre-orders will be sticking around until 8th February at 11:59pm PT / 2:59am ET (9th Feb) / 7:59am GMT (9th Feb), with copies expected to ship between 1st July and 30th September.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Capcom Arcade Stadium when it first launched on the Switch eShop back in 2021, and while the emulation wasn't always up to scratch, we called it "well worth the price, warts and all" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed more cast members for the upcoming <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, and there are more than a few legendary faces joining the series, including celebrated British actors like Jason Isaacs and Bill Paterson.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">by Amazon</a>, the show will include iconic <em>Tomb Raider </em>characters like Lara Croft's butler Winston, her uncle Atlas DeMornay (who you can meet as part of the so-called <em>Survivor Trilogy</em>), and Zip, who made his debut as part of the <em>Legend </em>sub-series.</p><p>DeMornay will be portrayed by Jason Isaacs, best known for roles like Lucius Malfoy in the <em>Harry Potter </em>movies and General Zhukov in <em>The Death of Stalin</em>. Winston, meanwhile, will be played by Bill Paterson, who you may know as <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Lyman Beesbury or the father in <em>Fleabag</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>A plethora of famous faces will be joining Amazon's <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They're joined by screen legend Sigourney Weaver, who will be portraying "mysterious, high-flying woman" Evelyn Wallis, ostensibly a new character created for the show. Since Weaver is playing her, though, you can expect her to be a major player, and I'd be shocked if she wasn't the main antagonist of the series.</p><p>Another British icon joining <em>Tomb Raider </em>is Celia Imrie, who will play the British Museum's "Head of Advancement" Francine. She, according to Amazon, is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne".</p><p>Sadly, we still don't have a release date for the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, but we do know it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3656d82-1a10-44f8-b35b-c2f90b2993db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">headed up by <em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> and that <em>Game of Thrones </em>star Sophie Turner <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8353268c-a5b7-45ad-b3ba-18b83eaad069" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will be portraying Lara Croft</a>. Production for the show will begin on January 19th.</p><p>It's been all go in the world of <em>Tomb Raider </em>recently; not only is the show moving ahead at full pelt, but two - yes, two - new <em>Tomb Raider </em>games were announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">this year's Game Awards</a>. One's a remake of the original <em>Tomb Raider</em> and the other is an all-new title.</p>
<p>We'll likely get more information about the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, including a release date, later this year, and more details about the two aforementioned games will probably be forthcoming as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>Ah, hello, Prince Arthur. This is King Dutch. Long time no see. We thought today would be a good day for rolling. The katamari. The gunslinger suffering from tuberculosis. Where the first rolls the second follows. Roll, roll, roll.</p>
<p>That, essentially, is the ethos behind a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> mod which streamer Blurbs created late last year, and has since shown off in a video that's heavy on large masses of horses and pardners being rolled into rootin' tootin' chaos balls.</p>

<p>Arthur Morgan runs around and objects nearby suddenly stick to him, forming a growing mass of limbs and wagon wheels that rotates and floats as a big glitchy mass. While the mod doesn't stick stringently to the Katamari series' strictly enforced size rules which dictate that you must start by rolling little things your size and can only roll up buildings or giant kaiju once you're sufficiently girthy, it looks like great fun.</p><p>Great fun that'll totally wreck your playthrough, but as a lover of those videos in which someone's turned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-iv">GTA 4</a>'s NPC car speeds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn04UwfKk9o">up to a million miles per hour</a>, that's something I can get behind. So, I reached out to Blurbs via Discord to ask whether there are any plans to release this mod publicly in future.</p>
<p>Sadly, it's very much looking like I'll never get my hands on it. One member of the server was quick to reply that, while I should certainly wait for the streamer themselves to answer, to their knowledge the mod getting a public release is "highly unlikely", citing Blurbs going about making his mods in a way that's focused on ensuring they work for him specifically as one of the reasons that's the case. Blurbs himself then responded, pointing to that answer and saying "basically this".</p>
<p>It makes sense. After all, making mods in a form you're happy to mess around with on your own hardware and pulling them together into a tight and polished enough package you're comfortable letting others give them a go are vastly two different propositions. Especially when it's a creation as chaotic and likely with potential to cause crashes or otherwise mess things up as this Katamari mod.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/once-upon-a-katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> has a whole wild west themed zone, so I guess I'll head back there and blast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK2PyG-UZhw">this video</a> on repeat.</p>

              <p>It can be such a pain to run out of battery, whether that’s on your phone, computer, or otherwise. If you find yourself in that predicament more often than is practical, you should have a portable charger to help make sure you’re juiced up whenever you need to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">The Anker Prime Charger, 160W is up for grabs at Amazon for a limited time at a discounted price of $105.99 compared to its original retail price of $150.</a> That’s a discount of $44.01, or about 29% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful yet compact portable charger</h2>
<p>This is a powerful and compact portable charger that lets you charge several electronic devices simultaneously. That makes it a great pick for cell phones, tablets, game consoles, and more. It provides up to 160W of power through each of its USB-C ports, so it can safely and rapidly fast-charge a USB-C laptop while charging two additional devices (phone and/or tablet) at the same time.</p>
<p>The USB-C ports are ideal for providing high-power charging to newer laptops, tablets and smartphones, while the USB-A ports are ideal for charging older phones, Bluetooth speakers and/or other smaller electronic devices. Additionally, the Anker Prime Charger has Power Delivery (PD) capability, enabling it to supply power to your electronic devices at the fastest possible rate, allowing you to charge your devices quicker and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Although the Anker Prime Charger has the potential to deliver a significant amount of power, it’s still super small. You can put it on a desktop surface, nightstand, or kitchen counter without taking up too much valuable real estate. It’s also super lightweight and easily storable in a backpack or travel case, making it ideal for use during business trips, vacations, or work-from-home/coworking days, when users would prefer a single charger to replace a tangled mess of individual chargers and cables.</p>
<p>Built-in safety features enable you to feel confident when connecting expensive electronic devices. The Anker Prime Charger constantly monitors temperature and power consumption to ensure that it protects against heat damage (overheating), excessive voltage, and/or electrical shock due to short circuit conditions. Although these protective mechanisms operate transparently, they offer considerable peace-of-mind benefits when you need to charge multiple high-value devices at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">This Anker Prime Charger is absolutely perfect for its size, capacity, and performance.</a> It eliminates clutter, enables fast-charging capabilities for newer devices, and is compatible with both home and travel-based environments. Bottom line? You should get one and keep it in your bag, car, or somewhere else that you use often in case of emergencies. You never know when you might get struck with a charging emergency.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m Begging For A Sequel After Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Ships 1 Million Copies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-sales-sequel-2000657141</link>
            <guid>1398481</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How many more copies does <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> need to sell before Square Enix greenlights a new grid-based strategy RPG? Almost three years later, physical versions of<em> Hi-Fi Rush</em> are finally up for pre-order. And how long will it take for Netflix to turn <em>Arc Raiders</em> into its next streaming hit?</p> <p>It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Depending on what you’re into, January will probably feel like a slow month for big new game releases, at least compared to last year. But I’m getting lowkey hyped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><em>Code Vein 2</em></a>, the follow-up to the messy 2019 action-RPG anime soulslike. This one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJLfjZd78hw">has a motorcycle</a>.</p>

 <h2>Even<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ original director can’t believe how well the remaster is selling</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I underestimated the sales figures by too much.😂😂😂</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/2008464271731257715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Square Enix revealed that<em> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> has sold over 1 million copies. That might be “below expectations” for the infamously disappointed Japanese publisher, but it was enough to take Yasumi Matsuno by surprise. It also prompted a fresh message to fans from the remaster’s director.</p>

 <p>“The entire development team is not only grateful to you, but, in order to spread the joy, create a better experience, and encourage more people to play, we are looking at updating the game in the future!” Kazutoyo Maehiro wrote, according to a translation <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/og-final-fantasy-tactics-director-admits-he-underestimated-how-popular-the-ivalice-chronicles-would-be-as-it-passes-1-million-copies-sold-with-the-remakes-lead-teasing-future-updates/">from <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. What does updating the game in the future entail, exactly? Could the missing War of the Lions content be officially restored? Could we get fresh end-game modes?</p>

 <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">told<em>&nbsp;Wired</em></a> last year. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

 <p>Let the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics 2</em> summoning circle commence.</p> <h2>You can finally pre-order a physical copy of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></h2> <p>The 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks, a studio that Microsoft closed in 2024 but which was later re-opened under Krafton, is finally getting a physical version that you can start pre-ordering <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/2008192175138299918">from Limited Run Games on January 23</a>. That includes a PS5 version. This is one game everyone should have in their collection, even if it could still be a year before it actually starts shipping.</p>

 <h2>We could end up getting an<em> Arc Raiders</em> TV show</h2> <p>Embark studio head Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">told <em>GamesBeat</em></a> that Hollywood is interested and so is he. “We [wouldn’t] mind doing that. It would be fun, but it needs to be done in the right way. I hope that we will do that. I think the IP fits quite well with something like that.” Nothing is set in stone yet, however, and Embark doesn’t “have anyone working on a TV or film adaptation yet.” Maybe we’ll see it on Netflix in time for <em>Arc Raiders 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Game of Thrones</em> star Sophie Turner was fine with her ending</h2> <p>She acknowledges that the rest of the cast was disappointed with their characters’ fates. “But I feel that I was very happy with the way Sansa ended her story in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and no one else was really happy with their ending,” Turner <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/sophie-turner-game-of-thrones-sequel-return">told <em>The Direct</em></a><em>.</em> “I feel like I got a good one, and so I don’t know if I could revisit it.” Would she come back to do more <em>Game of Thrones</em>? “Show me the money,” she joked. She might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">too busy with</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> anyway.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy 9</em>‘s character artist says goodbye</h2> <p>Toshiyuki Itahana left Square Enix at the end of last year. “Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX,” he <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">wrote</a> in a message to fans. He’ll continue to produce art as a freelance illustrator.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736">The Korean <em>Splinter Cell</em> revealed at last year’s Xbox summer showcase could be in trouble</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/guy-behind-viral-focus-m-gaming-meme-never-expected-it-to-spread-so-fast-2000656706">The guy behind the viral AAA <em>Mario</em> meme is as surprised as you are</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><em>Stranger Things</em> fans need to let go</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
