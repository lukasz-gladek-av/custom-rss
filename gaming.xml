		<p>Starfield is getting two updates and the first is the free Rev-8 vehicle that will be available right about now. “Now is your chance to explore new frontiers (and reach new heights) in your very own land cruiser,” say Bethesda,</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Official REV-8 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rA1z1DbA_Io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We also got an release date for the Shattered Space DLC and that will be out on September 30th 2024.&nbsp; There’s some decidedly spooky vibes to the DLC and trailer, with a mysterious power stirring the city of Dazra on House Va-runn’s hidden homeworld – this will be a big new area to explore akin to the other capital planets in the base game. Here you’ll investigate a new cosmic threat, explore a brand new planet and find new weapons, spacesuits, and gear.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Shattered Space - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNM1HFzQC8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“The home planet of House Va’ruun remains a mystery to the vast majority of the citizens of the Settled Systems,” say Bethesda. “The religious zealots that make up this clandestine faction are known only by their dangerous reputation. When a distress signal originating from a derelict star station leads you on a path to Va’ruun’kai, you’ll begin to uncover the secrets surrounding the followers of the Great Serpent. Explore a new location, take on new enemies and experience the story of House Va’ruun when Shattered Space launches later this year.”</p>

<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/06/starfield-review-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a look </a>at Starfield when it was released and this is what Stefan had to say:</p>
<p>“Skyrim and Fallout 4 had a space baby and named it Starfield. As with every child, there’s the hope that it will better its parents as it grows into adulthood, and from the time spent with Starfield, I’d say it’s right up there with Bethesda’s best. I’ve certainly enjoyed what I’ve seen so far and the new setting, but there’s just no getting away from the fact that it has its mother’s eyes and its dad’s nose.”</p>

		<p>Capcom has shared a good long look at Monster Hunter Wilds for Gamescom Opening Night Live, featuring plenty of big beastie battling. Monster Hunter Wilds is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s coming out in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 3rd Trailer | Lala Barina &amp; Scarlet Forest Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp4gR1QEvVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The third trailer for the game revealed the new Scarlet Forest locale, introduced us to battles with the Lala Barina, as well as the apex predator, the Rey Dau. Oh, and of course there was some new ways to cook and camp on show. Everybody loves cooking in games.</p>
<p>Capcom recently ran through the gamut of weapons and abilities that you’ll have available to you with a series of short and pithy individual video trailers – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/05/monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-focus-mode-seikret-slinger-wirebug/">see the first of those here</a>.</p>
<p>Players will have access to new gadgets and companions like the Seikret, a new creature that you can mount and ride across the open world. The Seikret can also automatically follow the trail to get you to the target monster, and give you time to heal, sharpen your weapons and grab useful items and materials that you meander past. It also has a holster to let you swap between primary and secondary weapons.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Slinger, which is standard gear for hunters in Monster Hunter Wilds and will replace the Wirebug from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. It can shoot out ammo gathered in the environment, and can grapple to draw in distant items (even while riding the Seikret), or interact with certain parts of the environment.</p>
<p>And you have Focus Mode, a new mechanic and combat technique, letting you aim your attacks and guards more precisely. They will now go in the direction the camera is facing, giving you more manual control. Focus Mode will highlight wounds on monsters, which you’ll then want to directly target to deal extra damage. It also enables Focus Strikes, which are particular special attacks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september.958554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-adds-real-elevators-with-no-loading-screen/">Starfield</a> was Bethesda Softworks' most recent game. While critics approved the game, the audience's reception wasn't as great. Starfield had mixed reviews on Steam, predominantly due to the number of bugs that were apparent in the game at release.</p>
<p>Starfield Shattered Space's release date was officially revealed at Gamescom 2024, giving people a glimpse into the upcoming expansion for Starfield. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNM1HFzQC8c&amp;pp=ygUZc3RhcmZpZWxkIHNoYXR0ZXJlZCBzcGFjZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major expansion</a> will be released on September 30 for Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is still no news of whether Starfield will be coming to the PlayStation 5 in the future or if Bethesda is even planning on doing so. At Gamescom 2024, fans got a small glimpse into the expansion, with the short trailer showing off some of the atmospheres and darker tones they can expect.</p>
<p>Starfield Shattered Space's storyline revolves around the mysterious House Va'Ruun and its homeworld, where players will get to investigate the planet and be introduced to a new cosmic threat. At the same time, they uncover the secrets behind the galaxy's most enigmatic faction. You'll get to explore the city of Dazra, whole of abandoned facilities and ghost-like enemies to try and keep you from uncovering the secrets of the Starfield faction that worships the Great Serpent.</p>
<p>Despite Shattered Space getting a release date, the trailer predominantly focused on the free update coming to Starfield, which is a specific, highly requested feature: the land vehicle REV-8. The free update will launch later today, making exploring planets significantly easier.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield - Official REV-8 Trailer | gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrWUv9vPOY4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The DLC doesn't have any form of Steam page, but the base game of Starfield is currently on sale for 33% off, the biggest sale for Starfield yet. If you want to get your hands on the premium edition of Starfield, that is also discounted by 30%. However, if you want to buy the Creations add-on for Starfield, you'll have to pay full price.</p>
<p>This DLC story expansion was revealed as part of the Starfield Premium and Constellation editions, where those who have purchased it can gain access to the DLC as soon as it is released. It's uncertain where the DLC takes place in the grand scheme of Starfield's endings, but it may take place before any of the Starfield endings.</p>
<p>Starfield is Bethesda's first new franchise in a long time. The game, which was first announced in 2021, will be released in 2023. However, Bethesda have been focused on other endeavors, such as Fallout's top-rated TV show, while adding new updates to Fallout 4 and Fallout: 76.</p>

			<p>ARC Raiders was first announced at The Game Awards in 2021, but news of the game has been scarce until now. At Gamescom 2024, they announced that the game will be officially released in 2025, and PC play-testing will begin this fall.</p>
<p>If this <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">third-person PvPvE action survival shooter</a> is something you're interested in, you can sign up for PC playtesting on Steam, where you can be chosen to participate. The first public Tech Test is set for October 24 through October 27, 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders - Official Release Window Trailer | gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fl_0b9ZsbBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In ARC Raiders, you get to explore a vast, lethal world where people have fled to an underground colony of Speranza, where they are looking for supplies and shelter from the deadly ARC machines on the surface. The need for resources is at an all-time high in the colony, and it's your job to help. You enlist as a Raider, fighting for your survival and trying to defend the colony.</p>
<p>As a Raider, you must scavenge and hunt for resources and carefully extract them from the surface while trying to survive the dangerous world above it. In your way are the ARC machines, a lethal foe that not many know about. You also have to compete against other Raiders who are equally trying to get the same loot that you are.</p>
<p>To succeed and grow as a Raider, you must return to your colony alive, where you will meet the underground traders of Speranza, allowing you to trade loot and valuables. They also have the opportunity to give you quests to complete, while you can then upgrade, improve, and expand your living chambers.</p>
<p>If you are getting stuck into ARC Raiders, you will have the opportunity to play this single-player or team up with your friends in co-op. You have to be able to think ahead of your actions and observe the world around you to try and choose the most tactical path that will allow you to stay safe as a Raider.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders was initially announced as a free-to-play game, but the developers behind it have now decided to make it a $40 premium title.</p>
<p>"It became increasingly clear during development that a premium model is a better fit for the experience we're building with ARC Raiders. This shift allows us to focus on what truly matters for this game -- creating an engaging, balanced, and repayable action survival experience," said Aleksander Grøndal, the Executive Producer behind ARC Raiders.</p>
<p>If this is a game you want to get stuck into, make sure to wishlist it and sign up for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public playtest on PC</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I've played Civ, and there are a lot of Civs to remember, so I'm not confident in picking out What's New here, but I think the unit animations are more elaborate this time, with battalions of tanks and herds of spear-wielders that could almost have been lifted from Total War. There's also a lot of nasty weather about, with some continent sized whirlwinds and lightning storms.</p>
<p>All that said, this looks like business as usual up to a point. You'll found cities, harvest resources, colonise the land around them, send forth armies, build wonders, and celebrate finishing a playthrough with either a cathartic exchange of nukes or a trip to another planet. Maybe both.</p>
<p>Oh hang on! There's a heck of a lot more on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/">Steam page</a>, including details of the new leader selection ("one of Civilization's most diverse rosters yet"). In a series first, "you can choose your leader separately from your civilization, giving you the freedom to create all-new strategies by mixing and matching gameplay bonuses". We can also expect "a vast, diverse range of cultural styles, represented across building architecture and unit design". The civs in the trailer certainly seem quite varied.</p>
<p>"With more than 30 years of franchise legacy to draw from, Civilization VII features a vast wealth of gameplay improvements that will thrill series veterans and newcomers alike," the Steam page summarises. "The overhauled tutorial experience and refined gameplay systems make jumping into Civilization easier than ever, while returning players will appreciate a massive suite of gameplay improvements. Move your army as one under the leadership of a commander, unlock progression bonuses for your leaders across multiple gameplay sessions, traverse navigable rivers, and much, much more!"</p>
<p>Again, out in February. I wonder if Gandhi is still a comicbook supervillain in this one.</p>

            <p>ARPG (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, the comments inform me) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-everything-we-know">Path Of Exile 2</a> will release in early access November 15th, 2024.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games have been set on a November window for a while now, but this is the first time they’ve nailed down a date, and possibly clicked on it a bunch of times to show how serious they are. Do a game related verb I can’t accurately name because I never played past that beach at the beginning of the first game, and do it in the general direction of the trailer below. Watch it. Just watch it.</p>

<p>Again, I’m utterly lost with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile">Path Of Exile</a>. I know they once sent my brother some sort of upgrade constellation print because of how much he spent on microtransactions, which may or may not have been a nice gesture. I’m not sure how much he spent. Trailer looks nice, though. Very gloomy. Good amount of wolves with too many faces. Plants doing things no plant should do. All the classics.</p>
<p>Dominic Tarason had a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-hands-on-preview-demo-exilecon">hands-on preview</a> with the game back in….2019! He fought some bad mushrooms, and a very large worm. Imagine that’s quite an interesting read still. A time capsule of what six years of development adds to a project, if nothing else. </p>

It started development as a DLC for <em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em>, but a new game was eventually spun off into its own title. Owners of the Ultimate edition of <em>Dying Light 2 </em>will get <em>The Beast </em>for free. Otherwise, it’ll be available for $39.99. Interestingly, the new game picks back up with the protagonist of the original title, Kyle Crane, as he embarks on a journey for revenge.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,196626,195624" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The trailer begins by following a squad of decked-out soldiers clearly in pursuit of some monster. However, it continues to cut to the perspective of the very same monster, which seems to have lured the soldiers out and is hunting them instead. Eventually, the soldiers and the unseen monster come to blows, and quite predictably, things don’t seem to go well for the unnamed soldiers.</p><p>At this point, the trailer then flashes to a man observing a rural region known as the Castor Woods through binoculars before revealing that it is in fact Kyle Crane from the first <em>Dying Light</em>. Sporting a gnarly eye, he seems to be taking on a new standalone adventure after breaking free from “13 years of enduring experiments” following the conclusion of <em>Dying Light </em>and its expansion, <em>The Following. </em><br></p><p>Kyle’s original voice actor, Roger Craig Smith, will be returning to voice him, saying “Stepping back into Kyle Crane’s shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend.”</p><p>Following those years of experiments, Kyle’s DNA is now interwoven with that of the very same zombie threats that he’s fighting against. Now, he can use the abilities of the zombies against anyone who stands in his way and unleash a “beast-like” power. Y’know, in case you were still wondering what the titular beast was.<br></p><p> Billed as a “thrilling 18+ hours” adventure, <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>will also feature full four-player co-op multiplayer and the return of vehicles to the series, which were introduced in the first game’s expansion, <em>The Following</em>. The rest of <em>The Beast</em>’s trailer shows off familiar bits of gameplay for folks who may have played or seen <em>Dying Light </em>before. Kyle engages in a fair mix of stealth gameplay with a bow and arrow while also leaping across rooftops and wall-running, as has become standard for the parkour-centric series. As always, the game looks incredibly gorgeous, and the trailer does a great job of showcasing a great deal of moody atmospheres.</p><p>Though no release date was provided, Techland did assure that there will be news on that front later this year. When it does launch, <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>will be available on both PC, current-gen console, and last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the most requested features since the launch of Starfield was the addition of ground vehicles so that planetside exploration wasn’t too unbearable. Following multiple teasers, leaks, and promises from developer Bethesda, we knew that some type of ground-based vehicle was on its way. But here we are, at Gamescom, checking out a brand-new trailer for Starfield, and we’re finally getting vehicles!</p>



<p>The Rev-8, a land rover designed for the rugged terrain of Starfield’s planets, is off-road capable, first and foremost. You can drive up the side of a rocky hill, chase down rare wildlife, load your companion into the passenger seat or your robot pal into the back. </p>



<p>Oh, and if you encounter any hostiles, don’t worry about a thing. A roof-mounted rocket launcher appears to take down foes with ease!</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the Rev-8, the Gamescom trailer for Starfield included a quick look at the upcoming expansion, Shattered Space. It was a mere glimpse of the alien-like landscape we’ll explore, along with visions that may make us all mad.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t just a mere look at the landscape. We now know that Starfield’s Shattered Space launches on <strong>September 30</strong>!</p>



<hr>



<p>While we’re all gearing up for Shattered Space, did you know the title of the next expansion may have already leaked? Supposedly, it’s called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-starborn-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starborn</a>!</p>

        <ul><li><strong>New Hunting Ground</strong> – The Scarlet Forest, a newly revealed locale in the Forbidden Lands, is a lush setting with towering greenery contrasted by waters dyed a <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son hue. Like the other ecosystems in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the Scarlet Forest is a dynamic environment that undergoes periods of Plenty, Inclemency, and Fallow that transform the landscape and wildlife residing within it.</li><li><strong>New Monster</strong> – One creature that calls the Scarlet Forest home is Lala Barina. Part of the Temnoceran class of monsters rarely seen in the series, the Lala Barina possesses sharp, spindly limbs and can unfurl its thorax into a massive, rose-like form that is as treacherous as it is beautiful.</li><li><strong>Apex Spotlight</strong> – Each region in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is ruled by an apex monster. Downstream from the Scarlet Forest in the previously revealed Windward Plains, a monster known as Rey Dau reigns supreme. Initially glimpsed at Summer Game Fest, the Flying Wyvern was unveiled today in its full glory. The apex predator of the Windward Plains is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Sandtides that transform its dusty grassland and can unleash destructive electrical strikes that pose a threat to even the most experienced hunters.</li><li><strong>Support Hunters</strong> – Whether playing solo or online, Support Hunters can fill openings in players’ hunting parties. These helpful NPCs include Olivia, a hammer-wielding member of the Forbidden Lands Research Commission, who will also play a key role in the story along with her elite Palico, Athos.</li><li><strong>More Moves</strong> – In addition to new allies, hunters can also engage with adversaries in fresh ways. These include the Power Clash, where blocking certain attacks can lock hunters into a physical struggle, and Offset Attacks, where a well-timed hit can interrupt a monster. Succeeding with these new abilities can knock monsters off balance to provide critical openings or trigger powerful special attacks.</li><li><strong>Windsong Village</strong> – The latest trailer also introduced Kunafa, a settlement hunters will visit in the Windward Plains.

<p>Back in 2013, Nvidia introduced a new technology called G-Sync to eliminate screen tearing and stuttering effects and reduce input lag when playing PC games. The company accomplished this by tying your display's refresh rate to the actual frame rate of the game you were playing, and similar variable refresh-rate (VRR) technology has become a mainstay even in budget monitors and TVs today.</p>

<p>The issue for Nvidia is that G-Sync isn't what has been driving most of that adoption. G-Sync has always required extra dedicated hardware inside of displays, increasing the costs for both users and monitor manufacturers. The VRR technology in most low-end to midrange screens these days is usually some version of the royalty-free AMD FreeSync or the similar <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/new-adaptive-sync-tiers-crack-down-on-misleading-response-times-flicker/">VESA Adaptive-Sync</a> standard, both of which provide G-Sync's most important features without requiring extra hardware. Nvidia more or less acknowledged that the free-to-use, cheap-to-implement VRR technologies had won <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/nvidia-certifies-select-freesync-monitors-as-g-sync-compatible/">back in 2019</a> when it announced its "G-Sync Compatible" certification tier for FreeSync monitors. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/">The list of G-Sync Compatible screens</a> now vastly outnumbers the list of G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate screens.</p>
<p>Today Nvidia is announcing a change that's meant to keep G-Sync alive as its own separate technology, while eliminating the requirement for expensive additional hardware. Nvidia <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mediatek-g-sync-displays/">says</a> it's partnering with chipmaker MediaTek to build G-Sync capabilities directly into scaler chips that MediaTek is creating for upcoming monitors. G-Sync modules ordinarily replace these scaler chips, but they're <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/245463/nvidia-g-sync-hdr-module-adds-usd-500-to-monitor-pricing">entirely separate boards</a> with expensive FPGA chips and dedicated RAM.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>These new MediaTek scalers will support all the same features that current dedicated G-Sync modules do. Nvidia says that three G-Sync monitors with MediaTek scaler chips inside will launch "later this year": the Asus ROG Swift PG27AQNR, the Acer Predator XB273U F5, and the AOC AGON PRO AG276QSG2. These are all 27-inch 1440p displays with maximum refresh rates of 360 Hz.</p>
<p>As of this writing, none of these companies has announced pricing for these displays—the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asus-pg27aqn-27-wqhd-360-hz-ips/p/N82E16824281235?Item=9SIA0ZXJT00136">current Asus PG27AQN</a> has a traditional G-Sync module and a 360 Hz refresh rate and currently goes for around $800, so we'd hope for the new version to be significantly cheaper to make good on Nvidia's claim that the MediaTek chips will reduce costs (or, if they do reduce costs, whether monitor makers are willing to pass those savings on to consumers).</p>
<p>For most people most of the time, there won't be an appreciable difference between a "true" G-Sync monitor and one that uses FreeSync or Adaptive-Sync, but there are still a few fringe benefits. G-Sync monitors support a refresh rate between 1 and the maximum refresh rate of the monitor, whereas FreeSync and Adaptive-Sync stop working on most displays when the frame rate drops below 40 or 48 FPS. All G-Sync monitors also support "variable overdrive" technology to help eliminate display ghosting, and the new MediaTek-powered displays will support the recent "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-is-anti-blur-monitor-tech-aimed-squarely-at-your-eyeball/">G-Sync Pulsar</a>" feature to reduce blur.</p>

<p>Game Pass Standard is Microsoft's attempt to "give players more choice" when it comes to a subscription offering, the company said. As announced previously, Standard comes with all the benefits of Game Pass Core, including online multiplayer and a selection of games. One of the big distinctions is the Game Pass Standard library is substantially larger than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-xbox-game-pass-core-games/2900-5716/" data-ref-id="2900-5716">Game Pass Core, which has 40+ games.</a></p><p>Game Pass Standard does not, however, include what is perhaps the best part of Game Pass Ultimate--day-one new releases from Microsoft.

First announced for PC, Marvel Rivals will also be released for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xbox-series-x/" data-ref-id="5005-129">Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PS5</a> consoles. Heavily inspired by Overwatch, the game features three distinct roles--Vanguard, Duelist, and Strategist--destructible environments, and a "team-up" gameplay feature that encourages active teamwork between players.</p><p>The past betas have given many players the means to try the game for free, get a feel for this all-new PvP Marvel game, and the player feedback aids in balancing certain characters for the future. Thus far, players have made their frustrations for Venom known due to being an absolute powerhouse running amok.</p>

                <p>The new Dune Awakening trailer, debuted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, showed off its survival gameplay and announced a release window of early 2025. The trailer offers a peak into the general arc of the game. You'll start Dune: Awakening by creating your character and choosing their background, before crashing into the middle of the planet. Staying out in the desert is perilous. You can get sun stroke and heat exhaustion from standing in the sun, and sandworms will detect you if you run on open ground.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud3EW5aAUZ8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ud3EW5aAUZ8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer then showcases taking out an NPC encampment. The game offers multiple strategies and approaches: You can get in close with a blade, attack with guns, block ranged fire with a shield, and even deploy a hunter seeker drone to kill from afar. After the battle ends, you will loot equipment and resources from enemy corpses. For example, you can take enemies' blood to purify into water back at base.</p><p>Build up your base with friends to unlock ways to utilize or refine the resources you gather out in the desert. After you've built the stronghold of your dreams, you can make blueprints of your base to recreate elsewhere on Arrakis or to sell to other players.</p><p>An ornithopter will let you explore the desert world to fill out your map and discover abandoned space ships, testings sites, and landmarks. In the relative safety of Harko Village, meet up with other players and NPCs or join up with one of Dune's great houses such as the Harkonnens.</p><p>To get real power on Arrakis, however, you'll have to gather the spice melange: the psychedelic that enables safe space travel. Spice blows can erupt into battles as various factions attempt to take Dune's most valuable resource. The trailer teases here that you can summon sandworms with a thumper, just like in the movies.</p><p>Dune Awakening will launch in early 2025. Xbox and Playstation versions are coming, but have no release date yet.</p>

            <p>Those Xbox players among us who have been waiting to get their hands on open-world adventure RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, I have good news.</p>
<p>At this evening's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-time-where-to-watch">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live, the team revealed Genshin Impact will be making its way to Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on 20th November. It is available to wishlist now on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/genshin-impact/9n7tffrrzcc9?msockid=262bc4fef6fc69612a9bd740f7376848">Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>The news was shared along with a new Natlan gameplay trailer (below). Earlier this year, Genshin Impact was once again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-voice-actors-speak-out-over-lack-of-diversity-in-genshin-impact-natlan-character-designs">accused of cultural appropriation from fans and voice actors in response to the reveal of its new cast of Natlan characters</a>.</p>

<p>"Set forth on a journey across a fantasy world called Teyvat," reads the store page's description. "In this vast world, you can explore seven nations, meet a diverse cast of characters with unique personalities and abilities, and fight powerful enemies together with them, all on the way during your quest to find your lost sibling.</p>
<p>"You can also wander freely, immersing yourself in a world filled with life, and let your sense of wonder lead you to uncover all of its mysteries... Until you are at long last reunited with your lost sibling and bear witness to the culmination of all things at the end of your journey."</p>
<p>Genshin Impact was previously released across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, iOS, and Android. Despite being announced for Nintendo Switch, we are still to hear any more on that elusive release date - it was first revealed back in January 2020. Another one being held back for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, perhaps?</p>

First, players will customise their own prisoner who swiftly crash lands on Arrakis and is faced with heat stroke and thirst.
</p>
<p>
From there, they will battle the sandy elements and join forces with other players to form a guild.
</p>
<p>
This being Dune, players will be battling over control of spice. And of course, giant sand worms can be summoned.

		<p>Funcom have released a new trailer for Dune: Awakening&nbsp; explaining how the game will play, the different character types, multiplayer features, mining, and base building. There are also secrets, co-op missions, flight, and the in game radio will give you regular updates of key event.</p>
<p>You will also get to play politics and pledge yourself to one of the houses and best of all, deploy a thumper and summon a sandworm!</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening – Exclusive Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ud3EW5aAUZ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dune: Awakening unfolds in an alternate universe where Paul Atreides never existed, and House Atreides survives the attempt to destroy it. This setting grants Funcom the freedom to craft a unique narrative within the Dune universe, empowering players to make characters who can&nbsp; influence the world without Paul overshadowing everything. The war between House Atreides and its enemies does continue on the surface of Arrakis, yet the Emperor has decreed that the Spice must continue to flow without any hindrance.</p>
<p>One of the core mysteries of Dune: Awakening is the disappearance of the Fremen. They have left behind remnants of their society, and their disappearance also leaves a vacuum of power that different factions are trying to fill. It is not confirmed if the Fremen do still exist, or if they have been wiped out completely. The narrative diverges from the original books and movies, as certain characters who would have perished still live, and various factions are advancing their agendas without Paul’s influence.</p>

<p>In Dune: Awakening players will come into contact with different religious and spiritual beliefs, which differ from group to group. This feeds into the overall story of how the various groups and sects clash with each other for dominance of Arrakis. This influences the gameplay as players will experience the mystical trials of the Fremen and explore various belief systems. It’s important to understand that although Paul was on the Messiah’s journey in the original Dune story, the player’s character does not assume the same role of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening launches on PC early next year, you can pre-order the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">Steam via this link.</a></p>
