                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, May 12, 2024. Below, we look at how its playful sense of experimentation is still leading to new discoveries.</em></p><p dir="ltr">There is no single file for "wagon noise" within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. At no point in your travels throughout Hyrule will you hear a single track that was meant to replicate the sound of creaking wood moving along a dirt path. That's because Tears of the Kingdom's audio system is designed to operate just like its complex physics system. Sounds that happen naturally in the world--wheels turning and hooves stomping, for example--come together just like the wheels and cart themselves. They create a harmonious sound that is made up as you play.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a charming example that highlights what makes pretty much everything within Tears of the Kingdom fantastic. Major elements of the game, from moment-to-moment exploration to the clever physics-based crafting system, encourages player-experimentation and provides an amount of freedom that's literally sky-high. For much of their adventure, players make things up as they go.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, Tears of the Kingdom may have felt less impressive after its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, inspired awe from players. However, the ingenuity of Tears of the Kingdom's mechanics shined beyond that first impression and continues to show how deep the game's possibilities are a year after its release. It's something that even its developers have a hard time believing.</p><p dir="ltr">"When I first saw the prototype, I thought this was going to be a great game, but I also knew: This was going to be very, very difficult," said Tears of the Kingdom lead physics engineer Takahiro Takayama, speaking at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this year. "I said to myself: Are we really doing this? Development is going to be chaos. The more I thought, the more I worried. I realized that sometimes, it's important to have the courage to push forward." Takayama then showed a montage of chaotically buggy clips from Tears of the Kingdom's early development. "As expected, the world fell apart."</p><p dir="ltr">Players have tried to manipulate every aspect of Tears of the Kingdom, whether it be to solve a puzzle, defeat an enemy, or create something absolutely beautiful.</p><p dir="ltr">Take Link's customizable home near Tarrey Town, for example. Players have the freedom to place sections of the house, including water features, various rooms, and stairs, in whatever manner they please. People have created symmetrical masterpieces and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/1bqs3mk/here_is_my_house/" rel="nofollow ">modern marvels</a> that feel straight out of contemporary Los Angeles. That's just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZj7utSClLo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GZj7utSClLo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Attach a few stone slabs together to create makeshift scaffolding and suddenly you have a way to make one of Hyrule's only floating houses. After a bit of construction and plenty of Ascension use, Link's house will literally sit in the sky, giving you an unobscured view of everything Tarrey Town has to offer.</p><p dir="ltr">It's such a small segment of Tears of the Kingdom – all you do with your house is store weapons, horses, and take the occasional nap, anyways – but players have experimented with the entire Zonai device catalog in order to see what was possible with Link's abode.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the first methods involved using Zonai rockets and hover stones to shoot Link's house into the sky and then keep it in place by activating the stones. Players found that ending the construction phase of setting up your home left the house in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">It goes without saying that Zonai device experimentation is at the core of Tears of the Kingdom, but the structure of the shrine system puts those devices centerstage. And players' thirst for experimentation is still leading to new discoveries. It was only one month ago that a player used one of the tricks in the book: If all else fails, blow it up.</p><p dir="ltr">Standing on a floating island adjacent to the shrine they need to take the gem to, they attach a bomb, a rocket, and a prayer to the gem before using the Ultrahand to stand the contraption upright. They launched the rocket and activated the bomb's fuse at the same time, hoping it would change the trajectory of the gem mid-flight. It couldn't have worked better.</p><p dir="ltr">The gem flew up with the rocket before being thrown towards the shrine by the bomb's explosion. A moment passed before the game automatically transported them to the shrine after the gem landed exactly where it needed to, in front of the shrine's entrance. It was one of those moments that only feels possible in Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">"I swear, it was my first try," Redditor liftingrussian wrote. "I was just curious as to whether it would do anything."</p><p dir="ltr">That curiosity is what Nintendo's game so expertly engenders. While Tears of the Kingdom has a structured narrative, the meat of the experience is finding out what's possible. Can you make a massive bridge of ice blocks by combining this longsword with a Frost Gleeok Horn? Absolutely. Can you glue seven gliders together and still fly them across the sky? Hard to say, but it's worth a try.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo aimed to create multiplicative gameplay with Tears of the Kingdom, which it boils down to "sticking two things together to make something new." It doesn't matter what those two things are--or even if it's 12 things--you'll always find something entertaining that will push your experience forward when you're experimenting with Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Players were finding new ways to take out Guardians in Breath of the Wild with amazing trickshots years after it initially launched. We will surely see players come up with new contraptions, new discoveries, and, above all, new experiences long past this first year of Tears of the Kingdom.</p>

Over the years, games that exist only in audio have taken players into entirely new worlds in which there’s nothing to see and still everything to do. These games have huge accessibility implications, allowing people who can’t see to play an equally fun, equally immersive game with their other senses. And when all you have is sound, there’s actually even more you can do to make your game great.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em>,</em> we explore the history of audio-only games with <a href="https://www.paulbennun.com/">Paul Bennun</a>, who has been in this space longer than most. Years ago, Bennun and his team at Somethin’ Else made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/31/5048298/papa-sangre-ii-is-a-terrifying-world-made-of-sound">a series of games called <em>Papa Sangre</em></a> that were among the most innovative and most popular games of their kind. He explains what makes an audio game work, why the iPhone 4 was such a crucial technological achievement for these games, and more.</p><p>Bennun also makes the case that, right now, even in this ultra-visual time, is the perfect time for a rebirth of audio games. He points to AirPods and other spatial audio headphones along with devices like the Vision Pro, advances in location tracking, and improvements in multiplayer gaming as reasons to think that audio-first games could be a huge hit now. It even sounds a bit like Bennun might have a game in the works, but he won’t tell us about that.</p><p>If you want to know more about the topics we cover in this episode, here are a few links to get you started:</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153892/verizon-tmobile-att-unlimited-plan-free-phone-offers-fine"><h2>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile’s ‘unlimited’ plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153097/ipad-pro-2024-apple-max-disney-bundle-foxconn-vergecast"><h2>The beginning and end of the iPad</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/11/24152977/android-ai-google-io-2024-gemini"><h2>Android in the time of AI</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153897/dell-xps-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-leak"><h2>Gaze upon Dell’s leaked Qualcomm X Elite-powered laptops</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/11/24154219/google-i-o-2024-what-to-expect-where-watch-livestream-ai-android-search-gemini"><h2>Google I/O 2024 will be all about AI again</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="cUe8vi">“Cozy games” are a huge phenomenon right now, because at the end of the day, who doesn’t like being cozy? While some games focus on visceral combat or thrilling narratives, cozy games often focus on creating a comfortable or fulfilling place for players to hang out. Instead of swinging a sword or slaying foes, players can focus on creating the perfect flower bed, or befriending the kind golem next door.</p>
<p id="ovVWUn">Coziness is still a subjective experience, and the finer differences in a game can make or break immersion. Some people love to fish, whereas I find it to be one of the most stressful things a game can include. We’ve rounded up a list of the coziest games around beyond <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115870/stardew-valley-8-years-later-concernedape"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783019/animal-crossing-new-horizons-final-review"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a><em> </em>(we figured you’ve played those, if you’re here), so you can pick your particular flavor of comfort. If you’re looking to relax, unwinding with any of these games is a fine choice.</p>

<p id="VfsUQ9"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071913/a-little-to-the-left-xbox-game-pass-organization-game"><em>A Little to the Left</em></a> is a puzzle game about organizing household items. It’s inherently satisfying while also being low-stakes, making it a perfect game to play when you’re looking for something cozy. The puzzles are stuff like organizing tools, removing labels from fruits, and stacking books — all while keeping an eye on a mischievous cat doing cat things. —<em>Nicole Carpenter</em></p>

<p id="uV7PqO">Despite its name being an accurate description of its offering — it clocks in at just a few hours before the credits roll — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/14/20864555/a-short-hike-how-to-do-nothing-impressions"><em>A Short Hike</em></a> stands as tall as the mountain you’re summiting in the pantheon of cozy gaming classics. This 2017 charmer from developer Adam Robinson-Yu helped ignite the cozy game craze and, for me at least, really “peaked” (haha) my interest in shorter games as a format. You play as a young bird on summer vacation on an island, tasked with reaching the summit to take an important phone call. Over the course of your short hike, you’ll meet friends, take on quests, and generally just <em>hang out</em>. Rendered in big chunky pixels and viewed from an isometric camera, <em>A Short Hike</em> leaves a dreamlike impression of long summer days, childhood anxieties, and the thrill of autonomy. My only criticism is that, like all core memories, I can’t go back and experience it anew. —<em>Chris Grant</em></p>

<p id="SBcxEN">Cozy gaming always includes farming sims, and there are very many out there (most chasing the glory that is <em>Stardew Valley</em>). <em>Coral Island</em> doesn’t seek to reinvent the formula, but expands it. The basic gameplay mechanics are familiar: you farm, you fish, you mine. But you also explore an underwater kingdom full of merfolk and the town events all have a Southeast Asian flair to them, like mooncakes at the Harvest Festival. Also, there are so many gorgeous, datable characters. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="xLWTbE"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Nintendo Switch, Windows PC</p>
<p id="sZS6iM">“Dorfromantik” is a German word, expressing a kind of aching nostalgia for the countryside, and Toukana Interactive’s game is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23049119/dorfromantik-review-1-0-update">like a peaced-out <em>Catan</em></a> — a game about placing hexagonal tiles with no goal other than to make pretty maps of forests, winding rivers, jolly towns, and patchwork fields. There’s no economy or tech tree to worry about, no population making demands of you; it’s just you, searching for harmony in the growing landscape. But as aimlessly cozy as that sounds, and as tasteful as the pastel shades of its seasonal changes are, <em>Dorfromantik </em>is an exquisite, hard-edged design that blends the best of strategy and puzzle gaming, and finds a perfect balance between mental challenge and mindfulness. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="3VvFBr">If you like your coziness with a little bit of horror, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669611/dredge-review-fishing-game-horror"><em>Dredge</em></a> is for you. The fishing mechanic is a bit of a rhythm game, and generally satisfying when you reel up the fish you want. You play as a fisherman exploring a mysterious cluster of islands. It seems pretty straightforward during the day, but when night falls, creepier and creepier things begin to happen. There are sea monsters, a strange occultist, and corrupted fish. Each area of the map offers different challenges, like navigating windy mangroves and speeding your boat away from vicious creatures, and while each is super beautiful, there’s also an eerie undertone to it all… But fishing is <em>so</em> relaxing! I understand why grandpas love it so much. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="sVKu0R">I suppose you could describe <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23682092/legend-zelda-likes-breath-of-wild-wind-waker-lil-gator-game-review"><em>Lil Gator Game</em></a> as Baby’s First Zelda, except I’m the baby and I’ve (exhaustively) played every Zelda game since 1986. But <em>Lil Gator Game</em> hits different, unencumbered by the very complexity that makes a Zelda game so satisfying. In its place is a pared down, speedrun version: a concentrated, potent play cocktail that finds you, the titular little gator, in the woods with friends trying to drum up some adventure… if only to relive your memories of playing with your big sister, home from school and too busy to play. This framing — of nostalgia and play — is a perfect mirror for the emotions you’re likely to run through as you explore the island, smash cardboard “enemies,” and take on quests for your friends. Very few games have captured this feeling of play for me, which makes <em>Lil Gator Game</em> an easy recommendation, and a game I return to more often than you’d think. —<em>CG</em></p>

<p id="0cGhGh"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23871826/palia-open-beta-review-in-progress"><em>Palia</em></a> is a game in which humanity has re-emerged into a mysterious and magical world. Each player is given their own homestead near Kilima Valley, a bustling village full of friendly elves and odd golems. As the player settles into their new home, they pick up a variety of skills: bug catching, hunting, gardening, furniture building, cooking, and foraging. It’s easy to fall into a comfortable rhythm with <em>Palia:</em> exploring the world by day and building up the homestead by night.</p>
<p id="lsM9QO">One of <em>Palia</em>’s biggest strengths is developer Singularity 6’s regular update schedule. Since launch, the developer has added a new villager, a regular festival, elemental temples, flowers, and more. It feels like the world is evolving in response to all the humans showing up. While I enjoy the game for its cozy vibes, I also get the sense that Singularity 6 is building up to something bigger, and it’s very cool to see these new changes. —<em>Cass Marshall</em></p>

<p id="CZIDJy"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24093693/sea-of-thieves-new-players-2024-updates-rare"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> is a pirate sandbox defined by the possibility of chaos. Not only do players have to worry about skeletons and sea creatures, but other pirate ships mark a significant threat. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23884469/sea-of-thieves-safer-seas-pve-only-server-season-10">The new Safer Seas mode</a> finally offers a much less stressful <em>Sea of Thieves</em> experience. Safer Seas disables PvP, allowing the player to explore at their own pace. While some regions are inherently dangerous, others are perfectly serene.</p>
<p id="89dKRv">I have rarely felt more relaxed than when I set out on a sloop, listening to the sounds of the ocean. <em>Sea of Thieves</em> has some of the best sound design I’ve ever heard, and it’s soothing to listen to the waves and the creaking of the ship. You can also play the hurdy gurdy with your pals, go fishing, and explore a bunch of gorgeous environments. If you’ve ever been turned off on <em>Sea of Thieves</em> due to the betrayal and battles on the high seas, the Safer Seas update should be right up your alley. —<em>CM</em></p>

<p id="wVU5TI">You might have heard of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/8/18/21373518/spiritfarer-review-release-date-switch-pc-ps4-xbox-one-thunder-lotus"><em>Spiritfarer</em></a><em> </em>before, the game that’s self-described as “a cozy management game about dying.” You might be wondering, <em>How could a game about death be cozy? Spiritfarer</em> takes the topic head-on and confronts fear and the unknown as a way to comfort friends whose time it is to move on. You do this by taking care of them, building up a boat in ways that make everyone comfortable. These acts of labor and kindness are so touching; while it may be emotional, it’s still got a lot of warm feelings. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="uVINnA">Like <em>Dredge</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22935956/strange-horticulture-plant-shop-review-impressions"><em>Strange Horticulture</em></a><em> </em>offers a spooky edge to the cozy gaming experience. It’s less of an adrenaline rush, though, and instead the sinister feeling slowly builds up as you uncover more and more. You play as the owner of a plant shop, and identify plants in your care, which are often medicinal in property. Customers come to you for help, and you must figure out which plant they need. It all takes place within your shop, with outside excursions detailed in text. It’s a cozy organizing game that escalates gradually into something more macabre. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="UH5SVy"><em>Summerhouse </em>has no rules. You simply build, using a bunch of pre-made, pixelated pieces created by developer Friedemann. You can build big houses or little houses, ones in the country or cityside. Every so often, when placing a door or window or roof, you’ll unlock a character — maybe a dog hanging out by a stoop, or a grandma sitting out front of a café. What makes <em>Summerhouse</em> truly charming is that everything is designed to look lived-in, real; these are no McMansions or prefabricated houses. <em>Summerhouse</em>’s sounds are delightful, too. The satisfying snap of clicking a window into place is made all the sweeter with birdsong in the background. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="MXkNNN"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24024185/unpacking-dark-star-mode-developer-interview"><em>Unpacking</em></a> follows one young woman’s life through all the places she lives and the objects she owns. You unpack various boxes containing all her items and place them around her living spaces, from her childhood bedroom to her first apartment after college. It’s methodical to fit all these objects in places, and also offers a little bit of freedom and creativity in how you place them (for instance, I always <em>always</em> put her stuffed animals on the bed). The brilliance of <em>Unpacking</em> is how it tells a story without any dialogue or seen characters, and only through these objects and where you’re able to place them. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="xXIQhI">Is there anything more cozy than walking into a kitchen where something fragrant is cooking? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23811258/venba-review-cooking-game-ps5-xbox-switch"><em>Venba</em></a> is a narrative cooking game that takes the nostalgia for food and uses it to tell a story about a family that immigrated from India to Canada in the 1980s. It’s a moving story about family and food that uses cooking mechanics to explore love and loss. —<em>NC </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="254" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While we wait (and wait and wait and wait) for Bethesda to say literally anything about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-whats-happening-with-the-skyrim-follow-up/">what’s happening with <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a>, let’s talk about <em>Skyrim</em>. That should kill a bit more time. Specifically, let’s talk about modding <em>Skyrim</em>.</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Since time immemorial (well, 2011), <em>TES5</em> fans have been modifying the game, improving it several folds, adding new content, fixing bugs…just generally getting as much life out of the ol’ beast as they can. It’s almost as if some people took one look at <em>Skyrim</em> in its vanilla form and went, “nah, mate.”</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Far be it from me to tell you there are countless ways to tinker with this aging epic RPG. But if you’re new to playing, or you just want a quick rundown on some of the better mods out there, I’ve cobbled together a list of what I feel are some pretty essential ones. You may agree with this list. You may not. I will be answering no questions.</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false"><strong>NOTE: I will attempt to provide links to mods that are for the Special Edition of <em>Skyrim</em> where possible.</strong></p> <h2 id="h-skyrim-script-extender" data-injectable="false">Skyrim Script Extender</h2> <figure data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim Script Extender: the SKSE logo next to an orange arrow pointing at the Vortex logo." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">When I talk about “essential mods,” you can probably interpret that as just meaning a “generally solid modification that many players highly recommend.” A lot of it will come down to personal preference and how you want to alter the game.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">However, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim Script Extender</a> (SKSE for short), this one is pretty vital. If you ask people in the community – especially the PC community – what to install first when it comes to modding <em>Skyrim</em>, this will likely be your first port of call.</p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">As the description itself says: this is a tool “used by many <em>Skyrim</em> mods that expands scripting capabilities and adds additional functionality to the game.” You’d be pretty lost without it. The version linked here has already been downloaded over 1.4 million times, and it was only uploaded in 2019.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Unofficial Skyrim Patch</h2> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Screenshot from Skyrim showing a forge next to a trough of clear water." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Arthmoor/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Bethesda games have bugs. The sun is a large ball of burning gas. Everyone knows the uncomfortable sensation of having one shoe tied slightly tighter than the other. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">Microsoft is pure evil</a>. Oh, sorry. I thought I was just listing things that can be filed under “the bleeding obvious.”</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">Yes, <em>Skyrim</em> has been laden with glitches and issues since the day it landed in video game stores (remember them?) While over the years, the developer has attempted to quash some of the major ones, there are still plenty of bugs that exist, even in the Anniversary Edition which came out some tens after the vanilla release.</p>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">That’s where the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unofficial Skyrim Patch</a> comes into play. It is, as the name suggests, an unofficial mod for the game with an eventual goal of fixing every single bug <em>TES5</em> has, and we all know that is quite the mammoth task. The most recent version was uploaded on April 18, which means the team is still hard at work. This is another must.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">SkyUI</h2> <figure data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="The original Skyrim user interface on the left and the more comprehensive SkyUI version on the right." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via schlangster/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">As gorgeous as <em>Skyrim</em> is (or was) when it first came out, there were some criticisms aimed at the game’s standard user interface. While I personally didn’t have much of a problem with it, I could see why it wasn’t everyone’s favorite.</p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">If you’ve played the game, you’ll surely have your own opinion about it. Which is why we have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SkyUI</a>. This is described as an “elegant, PC-friendly interface mod with many advanced features.” Even from the single image above, you can see the differences between the vanilla version and the mod.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Is it fair to say it’s more “intuitive?” I’m bold enough to go along with that. While there hasn’t been an update for SkyUI since 2017, Nexus Mods registers over 4.8 million downloads, so they must be doing something right.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Open Cities</h2> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim: a city gate open, showing the inside of Windhelm." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Arthmoor/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">A game like <em>Skyrim</em> consistently delivers and entertains, largely because of its immersive quality. Forget the fact that it’s now an older game. When it dropped all those years ago, it was a triumph. It drew people in with its utter splendor, enormous world, and cast of characters that were believable (well as believable as role-playing characters living in a fantasy world full of dragons can be).</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">However, some of that immersion does fall to the wayside slightly when you enter a new city, like Whiterun. Upon opening the main gate, you find yourself confronted with a black loading screen. It’s understandable. Bethesda couldn’t have put all the interior aspects of a city within the main world.</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">However, someone did just that. From the same modder that brought us the Unofficial Patch, we have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87707?tab=images" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Cities Skyrim</a>. This is a mod that fluidly blends the game’s city limits to whatever’s outside its walls. The loading screens are now gone, which keeps you immersed. Plus, it means you can now ride your horse straight into places like Riften. That can only be a plus.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Alternative Start</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim: the horse and cart ride into Helgen at the start of the game." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Arthmoor/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">When I first got the game in 2011, I was enthralled by the opening. A few days later, a friend came round because they wanted to see it, so I booted the game up, loaded a new save, and proceeded to go through the intro cut scene again. Then some time later, another friend wanted to see what all the fuss was about. By this point, my character’s head had been cut off enough times to satisfy a revolution.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">What I’m saying is, even before <em>Skyrim</em> had the long legacy it enjoys today, I had seen the opening section dozens of times. If you are a bit bored with that lengthy introduction, say hello to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alternative Start</a>. Oh look, it’s another mod by Arthmoor.</p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">With this, you get to opt for a different beginning to your <em>Skyrim</em> playthrough. You can choose to be a hunter living in the woods, a vampire hiding in a cave, or maybe you’ve been shipwrecked. The good thing about this mod is it doesn’t just give you an alternative starting point, it changes things about your character and doesn’t immediately put you on the main quest path.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Helgen Reborn</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim: an image of the tower in a non-burned down version of Helgen." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Mike Hancho/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">Speaking of that opening section, we don’t get to experience Helgen much before it’s terrorized by a dragon and left to burn in the ashes of its wake. It’s there and then, in the blink of an eye, it’s left in ruins as you run for your life and, presumably, bugger off to literally anywhere else.</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">With <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helgen Reborn</a>, the city gets a second chance. Modders Mike Hancho (aka Balok) didn’t just turn the opening location on its head by rebuilding it. No, they went above and beyond, bringing something that is more than just a surface restructuring.

Not just a facsimile of the world you walk around. It’s actually the real thing, just zoomed out immensely.

 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">However, it can always be better, and that’s what IcePenguin’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Quality World Map</a> does. With over three million downloads on Nexus Mods, it presents itself as the last word in <em>Skyrim</em> topography. Consisting of high-detailed textures, AQWM (as I’m taking to call it) is a tasty visual addition to your game. I’d say it pairs nicely with SkyUI as well.</p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">Also, it doesn’t just have this 3D map, either. It comes in a vivid style and even a paper version, if you want something that’s perhaps a bit more <em>Lord of the Rings</em>-y.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The wait for Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been extremely long for fans, but it sounds like the end of the line is finally in sight, and it might have been worth it.</p>
<p>Just two months ago, Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the developers were confident the game would be launched in 2024. Today, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPtzkxO0Ges&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief new episode of his Game Mess video series</a>, Grubb reiterated that idea while also adding that everyone (presumably at BioWare) is really happy with how it turned out now that it's almost done.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, this is one that I've mentioned before, is coming out this year. Will it be at the Summer Game Fest or around that time? Yeah, they've said that themselves over at EA. It still sounds like that game is coming out later this year, so where would they announce it other than Summer Game Fest? They could hold their own thing, but my expectation is they'll have - well, if they hold their own thing, I think it will be part of the Summer Game Fest orbit, so we should see that game at Summer Game Fest or around that time. And they should have all of the details for that thing because everyone seems really happy with that game; they're pretty pleased with how it turned out. The plan is to launch that this calendar year, so not EA's fiscal year, not before March 2025 or anything like that, this year. And I don't think you're going to have to wait too long after this thing gets announced to play it.</em></p>
<p>The next iteration in the Dragon Age fantasy RPG franchise has had a complicated gestating phase, to say the least. Originally, creative director Mike Laidlaw spearheaded a project codenamed Joplin that was supposed to deliver a smaller, more narrative focused Dragon Age set in the region of Tevinter. However, the project was canceled as it lacked the live service elements that EA wanted; this was before the release of Anthem. Laidlaw <a href="https://wccftech.com/mike-laidlaw-bioware-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left BioWare</a> as a result.</p>
<p>Another Dragon Age project got off the ground under Matthew Goldman <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with those live service elements</a>, but in early 2021, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-will-be-a-single-player-only-rpg-multiplayer-has-been-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that EA had been convinced by the success of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order of the commercial viability of single player games. As such, those live service elements were scrapped, and Dragon Age went back to being single player only.</p>
<p>In June 2022, BioWare finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> Dragon Age: Dreadwolf as the game's final title, which made perfect sense from a narrative standpoint to anyone who played the previous game and its post-launch DLCs. In October 2022, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-officially-in-alpha-playable-from-beginning-to-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it had reached the Alpha milestone, with the game playable from beginning to end. BioWare previously only had a few months from Alpha to launch to polish its games, whereas, with a likely Fall release window (which might drop near the 10-year anniversary from the launch of Inquisition), it will have been two years dedicated to making it shine.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game except for a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> direct control of party members (as usual for the franchise) might have been swapped for orders issued via a wheel, similar to Mass Effect. Regarding the available locales, BioWare revealed that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will allow players to explore much more of Thedas than in any previous entry, including Anderfels, Antiva, Rivain, and more.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will once again be powered by the Frostbite engine. It will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-event-based-on-community-feedback-live-now.868617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has kickstarted a new event in Escape from Tarkov, basing the parameters of that event on community feedback obtained on social media platforms. In the last few days, the head of the studio at Battlestate, Nikita Buyanov, was fielding suggestions and ideas from the community that was so disappointed when BSG revealed recent controversial changes to the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-tarkov-event-is-an-experiment">New Tarkov Event Is An Experiment</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1789584602551534007/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlestate Games wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As an experiment, we have removed the “Found in Raid” requirement for placing offers on the Flea Market for PvP and PvE modes. We will closely monitor player feedback during the event, and make additional balancing adjustments if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the most recent round of changes, which are live now in-game, Battlestate adjusted loot balancing (based on feedback) and increased the chance of rare loot spawning in certain areas. They’ve also tweaked inertia strength and boosted the overweight limit, allowing users to pick up more loot without suffering the consequences. </p>



<p>Further, BSG has boosted scav spawns on Interchange to make certain tasks easier, and adjusted the mechanics of the Flea Market to give players more ‘selling slots’. </p>



<p>Finally, The Lab is now free to enter, with BSG having removed the prerequisite that players have a Labs Keycard before they can get into this lucrative, intense map. </p>



<p>On social media channels, players have already responded positively to these changes, but many have recognised that this should be the standard and not a special, limited-time offering to the community.</p>

            <p>Players and content creators have hit back at Marvel Rivals for a playtest terms of service contract that prohibits players from making "statements that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>
<p>As shared by former professional eSports player and Twitch streamer Brandon "A_Seagull" Larned, the contract "signs away your right to negatively review the game".</p>
<figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals announcement trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxoRfbyqGJ8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In section 2.1 of the agreement – subtitled "Non-Disparagement" – content creators are obliged to "agree not to make any public statements or engage in discussions that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>
<p>This "includes but is not limited to", "making disparaging or satirical comments about any game-related material, such as game features, characters, or music", and "engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or differences of Marvel Rivals or providing subjective negative reviews of the game".</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Extremely disappointed in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarvelRivals</a>. </p><p>Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract.</p><p>The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game.</p><p>Many streamers have signed without reading just to play</p><p>Insanity. <a href="https://t.co/c11BUDyka9">pic.twitter.com/c11BUDyka9</a></p></div>— Brandon Larned (@A_Seagull) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>As noted by Larned, "many streamers have signed [the contract] without reading just to play".</p>
<p>Interestingly, the FAQs published in the game's discord community says that there is "no NDA for our Closed Alpha Test" and players are "encouraged to share their experience and all types of content on all platforms".</p>
<p>A couple of players <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1193841000108531764/1202076175355355176/1239193021917036544">have also shared concerns about the terms of service</a> on the official Discord server, but as yet, there's been no response to their queries.</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yeah I tried making a point about it in their creators discord, they said they’d “revise” it but the actual issues haven’t been fixed. This is the type of contract people get PAID to sign, and it’s just for a game code. Not to mention if you break it they can claim damages 😭</p>— Joe (@hzjoe03) <a href="https://twitter.com/hzjoe03/status/1789621768748995053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>Others on Twitter/X claim the developers agreed to "revise" the contract, but have seemingly yet to do so.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the hero team-based PvP shooter – which is published by NetEase Games – has yet to publicly comment on the matter. We've reached out to NetEase and will update if and when we hear more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">Marvel Rivals is an upcoming free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter</a> for PC with the backing of Chinese publishing giant NetEase.</p>
<p>Described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", Marvel Rivals will pit teams of six against each other as they fight it out over a variety of destructible environments with characters from across the Marvel universe. This includes the likes of Iron Man, Groot, Scarlet Witch and more.</p>

            <p>Steam representatives are informing some Helldivers 2 players that the game's publisher, Sony, pulled it from sale in regions where PSN is not available, not Steam itself.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers 2 players on Steam would soon be required to link to a PSN account</a> for safety and security. It said this was always going to be a requirement for players on PC, but due to issues at launch, linking was made optional for a period.</p>
<p>The news was immediately met with intense backlash, which resulted in an influx of negative<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements"> reviews from Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>. Many <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">asked for a refund</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 was pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> where PSN is not available, eventually leading to Sony overturning plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on Steam altogether.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cpdbdp/comment/l3k3ri2/">response</a>, a player was told that the game was pulled from "specific regions" "as decided by the publisher", and Steam did not know "when the game might be made available in those countries". Players were then invited to contact Sony themselves to "share [their] feedback" if they had any further questions.</p>
<p>The news should quell debates between players about whether it was Steam or Sony that had delisted the game in affected regions, but it's the latest in a bewildering and confusing list of missteps by Sony as it scrambles to mitigate the fallout.</p>
<p>As for why three additional regions have been added to the restriction, even though Sony has reversed the decision to compel players to connect to a PSN account? Apparently, that's to do with a similar delisting strategy for the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">Steam has taken the unprecedented action of auto-refunding players who bought it in countries where PSN isn't available</a>.</p>
<p>According to Helldivers 2 creative director and Arrowhead CEO, Johan Pilestedt, that was an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cpdbdp/comment/l3m4dn8/">"administrative error correction"</a>.</p>
<p>"So, to give an update on the three further country restrictions. It was an administrative error correction - they should have been part of the original restriction and it was noticed when the restriction was put in place for Tsushima," Pilestedt explained on Discord. "This was noticed and executed by Valve.</p>
<p>"While it doesn't look positive, it is not an indication of further restrictions. The conversation on region restrictions is still ongoing and is independent of this."</p>
<p>Pilestedt finished on saying that he had "no further information" but developer Arrowhead "still wants the game to be available everywhere".</p>

            <p>PlayStation has reportedly formed a new studio consisting of former Deviation Games devs.</p>
<p>Deviation Games' co-founder, Jason Blundell, is also rumoured to be part of the new studio.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As posted to the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, former Deviation dev Michael Anthony wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-anthony-72495a183_hey-i-hear-that-a-lot-of-previous-deviation-activity-7190611686209249280-44lx">LinkedIn</a>: "Hey, I hear that a lot of previous Deviation Games employees have setup their own studio at Sony working on an undisclosed new IP.</p>
<p>"All the people I see working there that have signed up are top class developers and hope that you can create a top class new IP with your studio that hopefully gives you all the time you need to create a quality product and not have to deal with red tape from previous projects."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cpicr3/exdeviation_games_technical_director_says_that/">Ex-Deviation Games Technical Director says that former colleagues have set up a new internal Sony studio (Led by Jason Blundel, new IP)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Careless_Main3/">u/Careless_Main3</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p>As for Blundell's involvement? Whilst the details are unclear and still very much just speculation at this point, fans have cross-checked recent announcements and <a href="https://twitter.com/JCbackfire/status/1736852589927702938">found this one</a> from Deviation's former community manager, who said back in December that they were now working as a junior game designer for a PlayStation studio under Blundell.</p>
<p>As yet, there's been no official word from Sony about the rumoured new studio, but we'll let you know if and when that changes.</p>
<p>Deviation Games was formed in 2022 by ex-Treyarch and Call of Duty developers and led by Jason Blundell and Dave Anthony. Eighteen months later, however, Blundell departed Deviation, and the studio then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deviation-games-reportedly-lays-off-dozens-following-a-difficult-situation">laid off around 90 employees back in May 2023</a>, citing a "difficult situation" that "forced" the layoffs. In March 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studio-deviation-games-has-closed-down">the studio was shuttered completely</a>.</p>
<p>The number of layoffs in 2024 across the whole games industry is estimated to be over 9500 so far. The total number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-cant-talk-about-2023-in-games-without-talking-about-layoffs">layoffs in 2023</a> is thought to be around 10,500, and 8,500 jobs were lost in 2022. Chris Dring, head of GamesIndustry.biz, recently explored <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">why there are so many layoffs in the video games industry</a> right now.</p>

            <p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed plans to "harness the power" of its game communities and use advertising as a "meaningful driver of growth" for the company.</p>
<p>In EA's latest financial <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-FY24-Transcript-FINAL.pdf">report</a>, Wilson fielded comments from investors, advising that whilst the megacorp needs to be "very thoughtful about advertising", given "many, many billions of hours" are spent on its games, "advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for [EA]".</p>
<figure><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"To answer your question on advertising broadly, again, I think it's still early on that front," Wilson said. "And we have looked over the course of our history to be very thoughtful about advertising in the context of our play experiences.</p>
<p>"But again, as we think about the many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting and where much of that engagement happens to be on the bounds of a traditional game experience, our expectation is that advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for us.</p>
<p>"We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that, but we have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences," Wilson added. "But more importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences?</p>
<p>In the same call to shareholders, House said EA was amassing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">"largest Battlefield team in franchise history"</a> to work across "connected multiplayer and single-player experiences".</p>
<p>"Our teams have listened to the community, have learned valuable lessons, and are driving to the future," said Wilson. "Motive, armed with cutting-edge Frostbite technology and compelling storytelling, is joining DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect to build a Battlefield universe across connected multiplayer and single-player experiences. This is the largest Battlefield team in franchise history."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Well, Microsoft's Windows 11 is about to receive its first exclusive ad featuring Xbox's Game Pass promotion under the "Settings" option.</p>
<p>News surrounding advertisements on Windows 11 has been circulating for a while now, and it looks like we have finally witnessed the new ad surfacing, promoting none other than Microsoft's gaming subscription service, Game Pass. In the latest Dev channel version 26120.470 (KB5037864), Microsoft says a new Game Pass advertisement will be visible under the Settings home page. Here is how the company describes the change:</p>
<p><em>We are introducing a new Game Pass recommendation card on the Settings homepage. The Game Pass recommendation card on Settings Homepage will be shown to you if you actively play games on your PC. As a reminder – the Settings homepage will be shown only on the Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 and if you’re signed into Windows with your Microsoft account.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1.webp"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="731" srcset="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1.webp 1024w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1-504x360.webp 504w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1-728x520.webp 728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>

<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-ps-plus-gaming-subscriptions-up-only-1-percent-year-on-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass growth</a> on the Xbox console has practically stopped, Microsoft previously said the PC version of the subscription service was still growing. Perhaps this is a way for them to bring Game Pass more visibility from non-core gamers who use Windows daily.</p>
<p>It's important to note that users will only receive the advertisement if they "actively" use the subscription service and have either the Home or Pro version of the operating system. So, judging by this, the advertisement isn't a move that would affect the user experience of the general consumer. Instead, it targets the specific gamer that would actually be interested in seeing the ad.</p>
<p>Despite that, the change marks the era of advertisements on Microsoft's Windows, and it'll likely be a move that would potentially add to the long list of Game Pass subscribers. However, Microsoft should also provide users the option of disabling such advertisements, or must at least provide a value to what users are seeing. A discount offer for new users who sign up through the OS would be acceptable.</p>

Unless you know what you’re doing, it’ll chase you, corner you, and make a light snack of you. </p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">You might just lose your mind when you first meet the Ostrich in <em>Animal Well</em>. Every creature up until this point has been pretty docile, but here’s a much larger one that’ll try to stomp on you and grab you in its beak with an added advantage. Its incredibly long neck allows it to pursue you around corners as you attempt to escape it. But don’t worry—there’s an easy way to get past it. </p>

This is much easier said than done, much like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-seahorse-boss-in-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every boss-like creature</a> in the game, but there’s one trick you can use to ensure you get through this encounter unscathed. </p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">There are five holes in the ground in the Ostrich room. Within these are four switches that you must press to unlock the door and escape. The Ostrich will reach down with its head and peck your last known location, so you need to time your jumps to avoid it as it does so. </p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">Then, when the Ostrich attacks, get away from it and into one of the holes so you can find and press a button. The Ostrich’s neck will likely follow you, so get as far into the hole as possible because the creature can’t reach right into the corners. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">After a short while, the Ostrich retracts its head, allowing you to escape and make a break for another hole. However, the Ostrich can trick you and push its head back down in an attempt to attack you again. Keep an eye out for what the creature is doing as you move, and you should be fine. </p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="false">It took me longer than I’d like to admit to get past the Ostrich in <em>Animal Well</em> because I wimped out and tackled other parts of the map first. This big bird isn’t nearly as scary as it looks, but it’ll kill you if you get caught. Stick to the holes and get right into the corners. As long as you’re careful, you should unlock the door and escape in no time. </p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There’s a menagerie of creatures for players to contend with in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>. Some are dotted around the world, and others, like the Snake, are in set locations with a puzzle that can have you scratching your head for a long time. </p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><em>Animal Well</em>‘s Snake is a creature you won’t meet until you’re exploring the final few nooks and crannies of the game’s world. When you do, it can be a bit of a challenge because it wants to crush you while you attempt to escape its arena. The additional element of difficulty here is that the arena is built to lock you in, blocking Bubbles and your Disc, so you’ve got to think your way out of it using a new method. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-past-the-snake-in-animal-well" data-injectable="false">How to get past the Snake in <em>Animal Well</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="snake in animal well" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">You’ll need to get past the Snake twice in <em>Animal Well</em>. The first is after you enter its room, having found the S Medal and using it on the snake statue near the starting room. A this point, you’ll be on the right-hand side of the room and want to get to the left, past the Snake. </p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">As you can see in the image above, the Snake will move around the room, creating shapes you can jump on. However, the creature will crush you if you stop moving, so this is pretty risky. Getting across with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-use-the-disc-in-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Disc</a> is impossible because of the vines dangling in front of both exits from the room, and this makes using Bubbles pretty challenging, too. The Snake will also pop these Bubbles and chase you faster than you can create them. </p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">The solution is to tease the Snake into the right-hand corner of the room, run to the left, jump on its head, and ride it to the exit. Jump off the Snake’s head before it crushes you against the ceiling. Beyond this room, you’ll find a new item: the Remote. </p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">This brings us to the second encounter with the Snake, which is much easier. The Remote will cause the Snake to come under your control so you can move it up, down, left, and right. Once you control it, try getting it to eat all the fruit in the room. </p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">After you’re done messing around with the Snake, you can use the Remote to create a bridge or steps to the exit, allowing you to get from the left-hand side of the room to the right-hand side exit where you first entered. Don’t forget to explore the room above the Snake’s room by using Bubbles because there’s an Egg in there you could easily miss. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/instruments-of-destruction">Instruments Of Destruction</a> goes to the trouble of having a voiceover offer a preamble to each of its missions, but I don't need it. Its launch trailer <em>knows</em> I don't need it, as its own voiceover makes clear: "Take this vehicle, destroy those buildings. Do I really need to explain why?"
</p>
<p>Nope! You don't. And the smashing simulator's 1.0 release is out now.

<p>This is the work of Luke Schneider, among others, and Schneider was the lead tech designer on Red Faction: Guerilla, the famed first-person demolish 'em up. While Guerilla often had you destroying architecture with a sledgehammer or some carefully placed explosives, Instruments Of Destruction sets you loose from its very first mission with some extremely powerful machinery. Expect wrecking balls, rocket-powered diggers, missile-launching mechs, and many more impossible machines.
</p>
<p>These are all prototype vehicles you've been charged with testing across a series of levels, each one an island where the main objective is to destroy some suspiciously empty buildings, and the optional objective is to, perhaps, avoid destroying a particular type of building, or to punt some particular objects into the sea. What I've played of it has been breezy fun so far, although there's promise of depth via hidden bonus objectives, high score tables, and the ability to construct your own vehicles.
</p>
<p>There are around 50 missions in total, but I don't get the impression that Instruments Of Destruction is something I'm going to mainline until complete. Instead I think I'm going to keep it installed for a long while and dip in for short bursts of bursting buildings.
</p>
<p>You'll find Instruments Of Destruction <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1428100/Instruments_of_Destruction/">on Steam</a>, where it's currently £13.16/€14.27/$17.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam, Epic, and Green Man Gaming are reportedly canceling and refunding preorders of the PC port of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092291/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-release-date-steam"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> for buyers who live in over 170 countries without PlayStation Network access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">reports <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. That’s despite the fact that arguably the most important part of the game is still playable without PlayStation Network account linking. The news comes after Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/5/10/24153281/uhhh-anything-you-want-to-tell-us-about-ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-requirement-on-pc-sony">abruptly delisted the game in those countries yesterday</a>. </p><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>only requires PSN account linking for its Legends multiplayer mode, a requirement the single player campaign is exempt from, the game’s developer went out of its way <a href="https://x.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1786462939748384943">to say in a recent post</a>. Steam, Green Man Gaming, and Epic Games Store each had disclaimers noting the same thing. In theory, that would mean if you don’t care about multiplayer modes, you could still play — but in practice, the platforms are now delisting the game.</p><div><p>The Steam team is <a href="https://twitter.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1789184327642984697?t=8MzM6vyZWq82IfKlShq3xQ&amp;s=19">sending this message</a> out to players who are being refunded:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>You are receiving a refund for a game you pre-purchased - Ghost of Tsushima. The publisher of this game is now requiring a secondary account to play portions of this game - and this account cannot be created from your country.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here’s an example with Green Man Gaming:</p><p>Frustrating as it is, the situation with <em>Tsushima </em>feels cut-and-dry compared to that of <em>Helldivers 2. </em>Earlier this month, Sony announced it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148144/helldivers-2-steam-psn-account-link-review-bombing">add mandatory PSN account linking to <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, which had already been available to buy in non-PSN countries for almost three months. Steam quickly restricted where the game could be sold to only countries where PSN was available. <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1786652818993999960">Players weren’t happy</a>.</p><p>Following a review-bombing campaign that slid the game’s Steam rating from “overwhelmingly positive” to “overwhelmingly negative” in a matter of days, Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">walked back the change</a>. But despite that, Steam didn’t remove the sale restrictions.</p><p>Then yesterday, three more countries— Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/">were added</a> to Steam’s list of sale-restricted countries. The CEO of Arrowhead, Johan Pilestedt, said on Discord he wasn’t told about the newly-added regions, only finding out about them through the game’s Discord community.</p><div><div role="button"

            <p>Samurai action-adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost Of Tsushima Director's Cut</a> is due to launch on PC this coming Thursday, May 16th - but it'll be available on Steam in nearly 180 fewer countries than expected. That's because its online features will require players to sign-in to a PSN account, and PSN accounts are not available in those countries. This is effectively the same issue that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">recently enraged Helldivers 2 players</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The 'purchase restricted countries' were added to Ghost Of Tsushima yesterday, as visible <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/962153/history/?changeid=23492090">in an update tracked by SteamDB</a>. Some players in those regions have reported that their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostoftsushima/comments/1cp2h5p/ghost_of_tsushima_being_autorefunded_by_steam/">pre-order was auto-refunded by Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Making matters more complicated, Ghost Of Tsushima is a predominantly singleplayer game, and developers Sucker Punch <a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1786462939748384943">confirmed earlier this month</a> that a PSN account is "not required to play the singleplayer game". It is required to play "Legends online multiplayer mode and to use PlayStation overlay."
</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 launched earlier this year and has been a tremendous success, but technical issues around its launch meant that linking Steam and PSN accounts was not initially mandatory. Sony announced earlier this month that this "grace period" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">was coming to an end</a>. The game then received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">over 100,000 negative Steam reviews in 48 hours</a>, with many players pointing out that a PSN account was not available in their region. Not long after, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">Sony announced they were dropping the requirement entirely</a>.
</p>
<p>"We’re still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable," said a Sony statement on the reversal.
</p>
<p>Ghost Of Tsushima is another game, meanwhile, and all of this is being communicated prior to its release. There's a note near the top of its Steam store page which makes clear: "PlayStation Network Account required for Online Multiplayer (Legends Mode) and PlayStation overlay, subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and User Agreement". I suspect that Sony will be less willing to back down this time - although it'll be interesting to see what this does for their Steam reviews later this week.</p>

            <p>Warner Bros., owners of the now-defunct Adult Swim Games publishing label, have contacted some developers about returning ownership of their game's Steam pages. The developers of both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/small-radios-big-televisions">Small Radios Big Televisions</a> and Duck Game shared the news on X yesterday. It's a seeming reversal of Warner Bros. stated policy back in March, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-leave-developers-feeling-sick-and-dizzy-as-more-adult-swim-games-are-being-delisted">when all Adult Swim Games seemed destined to be delisted</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Duck Game is safe!!," <a href="https://twitter.com/superjoebob/status/1788727928143872455">shared Landon Podbielski on X</a>. "more details soon but the email from warner finally came. the game is being returned to corptron along with it's store pages on all platforms, it's not going anywhere. thank you everyone... hoping everyone else got the same email."
</p>
<p>Owen Deery reacted to the news that his game Small Radios Big Television would be removed from sale by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-did-a-coyote-vs-acme-on-small-radios-big-televisions-so-the-dev-has-made-it-free-to-download">making it free to download</a> on March 5th. He shared an <a href="https://twitter.com/owendeery/status/1788570770232300021">update on X yesterday</a>, saying simply that it "will not be 'retired'. Ownership and store listings will return to me."
</p>
<p>Super Mega Team, the developers of Rise &amp; Shine, <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMegaTeam/status/1788814283335151753">also shared that they'd received the same email from Warner Bros</a>.
</p>
<p>Warner Bros. originally told Matt Kain, the developer of Fist Puncher, that "they made the universal decision not to transfer the games back to the original studios and do not have the resources to do so." Studio Bean, the creator of Soundodger+, was told by Warner Bros. that it would "only be fair to transfer no one's games since they can't do them all."
</p>
<p>Adult Swim Games was founded in 2005 but was restructured by its parent company in late 2020, effectively rendering the publisher defunct. They published games such as Robot Unicorn Attack, Jazzpunk, Westerado: Double Barreled, Headlander, Kingsway, and dozens of others.
</p>
<p>While Adult Swim did not seem to take IP rights to the game's they published, they did control the Steam store pages. Delisting those pages would have wiped away years-worth of Steam reviews, leaving developers to start over from scratch within the marketplace. Transferring ownership of a Steam store page can be performed in just a few clicks. 
</p>
<p>In instances where developers themselves are defunct, it's likely some games would not return to Steam at all - and that's still a risk. I'll update this post if more developers declare they've been contacted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="320" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Animal Well</em> players have been sharing an awesome discovery that allows them to completely skip one of the most complicated sections of the game, the Ostrich puzzle. While it’s amazing how the game allows for this skip, its discovery also makes me wonder how much of my life I’ve wasted playing legitimately. </p> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">In <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>, players are presented with puzzles that grow in complexity as they acquire new tools for traversal and that help them interact with the game’s world. However, you don’t need to use these tools for their intended purpose, and the Ostrich skip that many players are using now proves it. In fact, this skip may be the better way to complete the Ostrich puzzle because it avoids a soft lock. </p>
 <h2 id="h-animal-well-s-ostrich-skip-made-me-feel-incredibly-dumb-for-solving-the-entire-puzzle" data-injectable="false">Animal Well’s Ostrich skip made me feel incredibly dumb for solving the entire puzzle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-in-wheel-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="ostrich in wheel animal well" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-in-wheel-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-in-wheel-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-in-wheel-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-in-wheel-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">User rw_3eters on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/animalWell/comments/1cp7cx5/very_much_not_the_intended_solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Animal Well</em> subreddit</a> shared what they believed was the legitimate solution to the main Ostrich puzzle. This puzzle requires players to travel over and under quite a large area, pressing buttons before being chased by an Ostrich in a hamster wheel that might crush them. It culminates in a race to press a button to drop the Ostrich into the water and cause it to press the buttons required to open a door.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">This skip makes the puzzle, which equates to one of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-seahorse-boss-in-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Animal Well</em>‘s boss encounters</a>, entirely unnecessary, though. All you need to do is place the Slink on the left-hand side of the bridge, the main character on the right, and then use the Yo-Yo to drop the bridge, the Slink, and the character onto the buttons to open the door. It’s remarkably simple and makes the legitimate solution’s stress feel unnecessary. </p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">When I saw this, I felt really dumb for not even contemplating it. I didn’t try to open this bridge at all; instead, I moved left to discover the Ostrich and work out the puzzle’s solution based on that. What makes me feel worse is how users in the comments to rw_3eters’ posts are saying they used this, too. I may even be the only player who does not use this solution. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">Once I got over the humiliation, I realized what this says about <em>Animal Well</em>. The fact that you can complete a massively complicated puzzle with such a simple solution shows how open it is to be approached in any way players see fit. In fact, this solution helps to avoid soft locking a chest further into the Ostrich area, which you can block once you hit a certain point while solving it. </p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">I can’t help but wonder how many more simple solutions there are out there to the game’s puzzles that maybe even the developer didn’t account for. This post comes mere days after Animal Well was released, so I can’t even imagine what its Any% speedruns will look like at the next <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/resident-evil-2-remake-no-damage-run-agdq-2024-games-done-quick-carcinogen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDQ</a>. </p>

The improvements it made were minimal, and, as expected, it introduced a few new bugs. One of these bugs was a new graphics mode that just didn’t work at all.

 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">While the lasting memory I have of the <em>Fallout 4</em> next-gen update is how it indefinitely delayed the <em>Fallout London</em> mod, some fans experienced genuine crashes and game-breaking bugs. This is almost certainly why fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1corn3q/bethesda_on_monday_may_13_we_will_be_updating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> are discussing how they’re either rolling back updates or just waiting for Bethesda to finish updating the game so they can play a stable version with their mod again. </p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">User needconfirmation made a great dig about the Xbox Series X/S’s Quality Mode, which doesn’t work at all, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/cataferal/status/1783625872324370854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Foundry</a>. “By “new options” do they mean they are going to make the existing option actually do anything, because currently, regardless of which mode you use, the settings are the same.”</p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">It’s user blitz_na who accurately described what’s happening, though. “People didn’t understand there’d be a series of updates to this anniversary update instead of just the one. it’s going to be a repeated battle trying to bring everything to compatibility.” </p>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">Most, if not all, Bethesda games have some level of bugs and glitches that the fan base simply lives with. I’ve heard of these described as Bethesda’s bugs, mainly because it’s sometimes difficult to tell if they are intentional parts of a game’s design or a bug. </p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="false">Right now, we’re in the midst of a slew of updates Bethesda is rolling out to bring <em>Fallout 4</em> on all platforms in line with its vision of the game on current-generation hardware. The only issue is that no one really knows what the intended final outcome is. That’s why some fans aren’t touching the game while others are rolling back the updates, and more are still trying to play because they love the game and see how far they get before they find a bug to report. </p>

<p data-characters="461" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">All those years of stepping on insects have come back to bite us in the butt. Like the many other creatures in the Appalachian Wasteland of <em>Fallout 76</em>, insects have evolved to become some of the most terrifying enemies around. Despite that, insects are one of the more convenient enemy types to eliminate for the Big Game Hunter daily quest. So grab your insect repellent and weapon of choice; we’re showing you all of the best insect locations in <em>Fallout 76</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-all-insect-locations-in-fallout-76" data-injectable="false">All insect locations in <em>Fallout 76</em></h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">Of the many insect locations across the Appalachian Wasteland, Aaronholt Homestead, Carson Family Bunker, and Fort Defiance are the best for completing quick and easy daily quests.

Some of them float like butterflies, and all of them sting like bees.</p>

While each of them is fantastic for slaying undead and aliens alike, obtaining the weapon evolutions is your winning ticket for completing levels and tasks. To do so, players will need to make use of the new Weapon Power-up items in addition to the usual combos. Here’s how to evolve each weapon.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-upgrade-each-weapon-in-vampire-survivors-operation-guns" data-injectable="false">How to upgrade each weapon in Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vampire-survivors-operation-guns-weapon-upgrades.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Long Gun -&gt; Prototype A</strong> <ul> <li>Long Gun + Weapon Power-up</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Homing Miss -&gt; Multistage Missiles</strong> <ul> <li>Homing Miss + Weapon Power-up + Duplicator</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Blade Crossbow -&gt; BFC2000-AD</strong> <ul> <li>Blade Crossbow + Weapon Power-up + Clover</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Sonic Bloom -&gt; Wave Beam</strong> <ul> <li>Sonic Bloom + Weapon Power-up + Armor</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Short Gun -&gt; Prototype B</strong> <ul> <li>Short Gun + Weapon Power-up + Bracer</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Spread Shot -&gt; Prototype C</strong> <ul> <li>Spread Shot + Weapon Power-up + Empty Tome</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>C-U-Laser -&gt; Pronto Beam</strong> <ul> <li>C-U-Laser + Weapon Power-up + Tirajisu</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Firearm -&gt; Fire L3GS</strong> <ul> <li>Firearm + Weapon Power-up + Candelabrador</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Diver Mines -&gt; Atmo-Torpedo</strong> <ul> <li>Diver Mines + Weapon Power-up + Attractorb</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Metal Claw -&gt; Big Fuzzy Fist</strong> <ul> <li>Metal Claw + Weapon Power-up + Hollow Heart</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">After getting the initial weapon upgrade, I haven’t seen a need for the Weapon Power-up on subsequent runs in terms of being a necessary ingredient. Once it’s in the grimoire, you should be good to go with other characters, maps, etc. That being said, it’s still a good idea to collect them as they’ll give +1 to a random equipped weapon in addition to a Revive.</p> <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="906" data-injectable="true">As for procuring the upgrade, I found it easiest to pick the corresponding <em>Contra</em> character that starts with the weapon you want to upgrade and load into the “Attack Aggressively” level. There are two Weapon Power-ups fairly close by you can pick up. As for the Passive Power-up, make sure to save a slot for the item you need, and don’t be afraid to use your Rerolls or Banishments. Once the weapon and passive item are upgraded, it’s only a matter of getting a chest to drop with the evolution.</p>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">It shouldn’t take too long to find each weapon evolution this way, and you’ll then be set up for success in other modes. One last tip is to avoid collecting too many of the base <em>Operation Guns</em> weapons when trying to unlock the evolutions. This way, you’ll avoid the chance of burning a Weapon Power-up on an evolution you didn’t want.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been claimed on social media that Sony has established a brand-new studio within the confines of PlayStation stocked to the rafters with former Deviation Games employees. It was further reported that Jason Blundell, one of the co-founders of Deviation, is involved with the project at a senior level.</p>



<p>The latest info that was recently revealed follows rumours that first popped up in December 2023.</p>



<p>In March, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deviation-games-closes/">Deviation Games was shut down</a> without shipping a single game. Backed by a flock of former Call of Duty veterans, Deviation Games was reportedly working on a AAA shooter when it was shuttered amid ongoing industry-wide struggles. That shutdown came following a mass layoff wave that wiped out as many as 90 employees.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-class-new-ip">‘Top-Class New IP’</h2>



<p>In a post from former Deviation Games employee Michael Anthony, which surfaced on LinkedIn (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-reportedly-forms-studio-with-former-deviation-games-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to VGC</a>), the news is all but confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hear that a lot of previous Deviation Games employees have setup their own studio at Sony working on an undisclosed new IP.<br>All the people I see working there that have signed up are top class developers and hope that you can create a top class new IP with your studio that hopefully gives you all the time you need to create a quality product and not have to deal with red tape from previous projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following that comment, Anthony wrote, ‘Go go JB and do what you do best’. </p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-possibly-building-new-studio-of-ex-deviation-games-talent/">rumours started surfacing</a> about the new studio, with Jason Blundell stating that he is ‘Leading the design for an unannounced project’. If that’s the case, the studio has been cooking in the background for several months with nothing announced. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The first two proper episodes (discounting the Christmas special) of Doctor Who season 14, starring Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor, have reached Disney Plus and BBC iPlayer, meaning that viewers are now able to dig deep and overanalyze everything for clues about what’s to come.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">If there’s one thing that Whovians do really well, it’s looking beneath the surface to find foreshadowing. This week, there’s one thing that’s got a few fans talking—The One Who Waits. This as-yet-unknown character was mentioned during The Giggle, which aired back in December, but the moniker comes back up during this week’s second released episode, The Devil’s Chord.</p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="710" data-injectable="true">I’m going to hedge my bets and say that The One Who Waits is not a confirmation that Amy and Rory (the Doctor’s companions from the time of the Eleventh Doctor, portrayed by Matt Smith) are about to return. Yes, Rory was known as “the boy who waited”, which is a very similar moniker, but not quite the same.&nbsp;</p>

Buckle in because this one is a bit of a ride.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">During The Devil’s Chord, during a discussion with Ruby on a London rooftop, the Doctor talks of his Granddaughter Susan, who he says is currently living with a previous version of himself on the other side of the city. He also admits to Ruby that he currently doesn’t know what became of Susan after the Genocide, which took the lives of all Time Lords except himself.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">At the end of The Devil’s Chord, before we’re assaulted by a slightly out-of-place song and dance number, the Doctor breaks the fourth wall and winks at the camera after saying, “There’s always a twist at the end.” Still with me? Good.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Now, if you dig a little deeper into the casting of this series, you’ll find that there is actually an actress called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878610/">Susan Twist</a> in the cast, and this is where things start to get really interesting. Susan Twist has had a very short cameo appearance in every single one of Ncuti’s episodes so far, one of the 60th Anniversary Specials with David Tennant, and, according to the sneak peek clip that is available for the next episode, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NUtlh2I2qE">Boom</a>, she’s in that one too.</p>

She says she wishes she could be “Margaret Lockwood”. What a woman, indeed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">According to the cast list for Boom, which is written by Steven Moffat, Twist will appear again, though her role is simply called “Ambulance”.</p> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone anonymously pointed me in the direction of this. It was implied we will see Mrs Merridew again in the form of Susan Triad. Russell T Davies has a "Union Jack ICON" magazine mockup cover featuring her in his office. Triad Technology from 2024 series filming reports. <a href="https://t.co/SRqtmZhu9p">pic.twitter.com/SRqtmZhu9p</a></p>— Doctor Who Production News (@DoctorWhoPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/DoctorWhoPN/status/1737050144603095101?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">There are unconfirmed rumors that Twist will play a bigger part in the future of the series, taking the also unconfirmed role of Susan Triad. She will be the head of a company named Triad, which has already been name-dropped during the 60th anniversary special, The Giggle when Mel Bush is attempting to align the satellites. Remember, this is an unconfirmed rumor, but I’m counting nothing out of possibility.</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">So what’s the theory here? Well, we know that The One Who Waits has some connection to both the Toymaker and Maestro, considering the apparent relation between the two and the fact that they both issue a warning to the Doctor about The One Who Waits. It’s also been revealed, though in the Doctor Who audiobooks rather than the TV show, that the Toymaker has a sister who goes by the name of Hecuba.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Maestro and the Toymaker in Doctor Who" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/toymaker-and-maestro.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">Hecuba, otherwise known as “The Queen of Time”, would be able to traverse through time in order to appear at any moment, which would explain why Twist’s characters never look as though they’ve aged, regardless of how many years in the past or future she appears. It would make sense, then, to assume that Hecuba, if that’s who this turns out to be, has been waiting a long time to confront the Doctor for whatever reason, likely in retaliation for what happened to her brother.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="false">Whether or not this theory turns out to be true remains to be seen, but it’s definitely interesting to dive deep into Doctor Who and find the connections or even just speculate. There’s no telling what could happen in the coming episodes, with Russell T Davies (who is responsible for writing the vast majority of this season’s episodes) well known for putting twists and turns in his writing.</p>

<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Polar Patriots Warbond launched in <em>Helldivers 2</em> this week, bringing with it new armor, weapons, and cosmetics, though some gear is lacking a feature that many of us were hoping would make it easier to reverse icy worlds. </p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">There are two sets of armor in the Polar Patriots Warbond in <em>Helldivers 2</em> that have cleats on the boots. The CW-36 Winter Warrior, which is a lovely white number, and the CW-22 Kodiak, a much more understated gray camo affair. Unfortunately, both actively work against the idea of function over fashion, with functional footwear that’s all for show. </p> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-s-polar-patriots-armor-won-t-stop-you-slipping-on-ice" data-injectable="false">Helldivers 2’s Polar Patriots armor won’t stop you slipping on ice</h2> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Warbond: Polar Patriots Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcnzI0gN7z4?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Two armor sets from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-everything-in-the-polar-patriots-warbond-and-their-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polar Patriots Warbond</a> in <em>Helldivers 2</em> have cleats on their boots. In real life, these are designed to help mountain climbers and those exploring icy parts of the world have sure footing by penetrating ice and holding fast when other footwear would slip. Sadly, these in-game counterparts don’t do anything, and players are still slipping and sliding across the ice as they battle Terminids and Automatons for Super Earth. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">Players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cnxoxd/ice_cleat_boots_for_the_new_armor_doesnt_work_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit</a> picked this up on the same day the Warbond was released. I’m really quite cross about this because when I first saw the trailer for the Warbond, I thought the armor might have a hidden perk that helps you run across the ice on worlds where you’re normally slipping around, mostly into enemies. </p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">Sadly, I was mistaken, and it doesn’t look like I’m the only one who is disappointed. User spinyfever sums it up best: “I don’t understand why they would release a snow/ice-themed Warbond and not have the armors provide any advantages in snow/ice. Two of the new armors have crampons designed into the boots. Their literal purpose is to stop you from slipping and sliding on ice.”</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Ice planets might be the worst environment to fight in because there are plants that explode and slow you down with an area of effect debuff, and enemies can rush you across lakes of frozen water while you skid into a rock and welcome them with open arms. </p> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">In fact, the Warbond doesn’t really include anything designed to help players deliver democracy on icy planets. The Booster, Motivational Shocks, is designed to negate the slow effect Terminid acid causes, not the explosions from plants on icy worlds that do the exact same thing. The armor certainly looks the part, though, and I can’t deny that I love the idea of this ice-themed Warbond <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-polar-patriots-warbond-will-heat-things-up-next-week-with-spicy-new-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">packing in a new incendiary grenade</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="false">However, these cleats not working somehow manage to fit extremely well with the game’s lore. Super Earth has a habit of throwing new tech out there without testing it and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/termicide-just-made-helldivers-2s-terminids-stronger-and-stranger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blaming others for the problems it causes</a>. It’s also known for pulling just the right tool out of nowhere right after Helldivers have been pushed to their limit without it. If I were living in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, I’d expect cleats to start working after thousands of Helldivers had lost their lives to broken necks or deaths all linked to slipping on ice. </p>

            <link>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-studio-head-leans-on-community-for-fix-suggestions.868398/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-studio-head-leans-on-community-for-fix-suggestions.868398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following a turbulent time for Escape from Tarkov fans, Battlestate Games’ head of the studio, Nikita Buyanov, has tried to push the water under the bridge by leaning on the community for suggestions. He appeared on Twitter prompting players to ‘shoot their ideas’ at him before mentioning a proposed change that would remove the ‘Found in Raid’ requirement from the in-game flea market as a ‘test event’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-on-the-horizon">Changes On The Horizon</h2>



<p>Buyanov’s thread regarding ideas and suggestions was built off the back of a comment made by a popular Escape from Tarkov streamer, Velion. He noted some key changes he’d like to see in the game, which spurred Nikita into action, and within a few hours, he’d picked up more than 1000 comments – many of which were loaded with suggestions for improvements and amendments.</p>



<p>Following the last week or two of ‘Tarkov drama’, which included the emergence of Arena Breakout: Infinite, a well-received Tarkov clone from a Tencent subsidiary, Buyanov wrote on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s been a rough couple of weeks. We wanted to keep it quiet but it’s up to you to decide if you would like to support this kind of things and stick to the games that not only entre the genre but do not hesitate to copy what has been done. Believe me we are focusing no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One idea that Nikita is willing to at least test is removing the ‘Found in Raid’ requirement from flea market items. Typically, players can only use the fleamarket to sell things that they’ve found and recovered from a raid – but that might change with this test. It’ll return Escape from Tarkov to a time gone by, as this was once the standard. With this change being applied, players would be able to loot the PMCs that they kill and sell their equipment to other players through the flea market.</p>



<p>It would also make top-tier ammunition and meta items readily available – if massively expensive.</p>



<p>That garnered a mixed response from the community, with some suggesting ‘tweaks’ on the test, such as this comment from ‘John B’:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maybe allow selling of non FIR stuff (like other ppls gear) only immediately after the raid – similar to when you're on a scav and selling to fence. Would stop people flipping stuff but still incentivise PVP.</p>— John B (@johnbbeta) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnbbeta/status/1789296158537326596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s expected that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">Escape from Tarkov will ‘wipe’ next month</a>. That’s the event wherein the game is globally reset, putting players back to a level pegging and forcing them to restart at the bottom-most level. It’s likely Nikita and his team will roll out any such tests before then, as the run-up to the wipe is typically a proving ground for mini-events like this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crow Country features only a handful of weapons, but about half of them can be easily missed. The flamethrower, a late-game unlockable that relies on gasoline for fuel, is no exception. Let’s quickly go over what you’ll need to unlock it, 100% spoiler-free.</p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">First, you’ll need to be sure you’ve obtained the <strong>Data Disk</strong>. This is a mandatory late-game item, so if you haven’t found it yet, you don’t need to worry about missing out on the flamethrower. Just come back to this guide once you’ve got your hands on it.</p> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Next, head to the Train Room:</p> <figure data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-room-map.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Once inside, access the terminal at the back left of the room by using your Data Disk. You’ll be met with a screen that asks you to assign a letter to each of a train’s cars. The train on display in the room is your rubric, while the two plaques and buttons will give you clues as to which letter to assign to each car. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">The first plaque says the cars it activates are done in the <strong>A</strong>rabella and <strong>B</strong>ernadette styles, while the second says its cars display the <strong>A</strong>rabella and <strong>D</strong>elilah styles. These are the letters you’ll need to punch in the terminal, and the “styles” they refer to are the shapes found on the top of the cars (not their color, as I initially assumed). </p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">The solution to the puzzle is as follows:</p> <figure data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-train-solution.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true">And if you want to see exactly how these are determined, here’s a quick breakdown of each “style” that appears on the two running trains (C is entered by process of elimination). The trip-up here is that “A” can appear as either a single rectangle or as two rectangles next to each other:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Crow-Country-Train-Puzzle.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Diagram by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="false">Just punch these in, and one of the cars in the display train will open containing your prize! By this point in the game, you’re likely flush with fuel, so get out there and scorch some flesh.</p>

Here’s how to complete the Seaman Challenge in&nbsp;<em>BitLife</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-bitlife-seaman-challenge-guide" data-injectable="false"><em>BitLife</em> Seaman Challenge guide</h2> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false">The Seaman Challenge in <em>BitLife</em> has five objectives to complete:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false"> <li>Be born a male in Alaska</li> <li>Get an honorable discharge from the Navy</li> <li>Become a crab fisherman</li> <li>Purchase a boat worth $2,000,000</li> <li>Sail on your boat worth $2,000,000 three times</li> </ul> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">For the most part, you can complete the middle three tasks in any order you wish. However, going through them in the order they appear is the easiest way to finish the Seaman Challenge, especially since you’ll need time to raise money for your boat.</p>
 <h3 id="h-be-born-a-male-in-alaska" data-injectable="false">Be born a male in Alaska</h3> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Your first objective is to be born a male in Alaska. To do this, create a new character whose starting gender is male, whose&nbsp;country is the United States, and whose starting place is Anchorage. Anchorage is the largest city in Alaska, making it a great place to start for this challenge.</p> <figure data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="BitLife Alaska starting screen" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitlife-alaska.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="129" data-current-count="129" data-injectable="false">Once you create your Alaskan character, age them until they turn 18, avoiding any and all crime so they can easily join the Navy.</p> <h3 id="h-get-an-honorable-discharge-from-the-navy" data-injectable="false">Get an honorable discharge from the Navy</h3> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">After your character turns 18, head into the Occupation tab and select Military. Here, you’ll find the Navy, which you’ll have to enlist and perform well for at least four years. Once you have worked hard and have lasted at least four years in the Navy, you can request a discharge to receive an honorable discharge, knocking out the second task.</p>

To do this, head into the full-time job list and continue searching until you spot the Greenhorn position. You’ll know you’ve found it when you see a job with a crab emoji icon next to its name. If you don’t see it, close and reopen the&nbsp;<em>BitLife&nbsp;</em>app or age up your character and recheck the list.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Once you spot the Greenhorn job, apply for the position and pass the interview to become a crab fisherman. Three tasks down, two more to go.</p> <h3 id="h-purchase-and-sail-a-boat-worth-2-000-000" data-injectable="false">Purchase and sail a boat worth $2,000,000</h3> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">The last two tasks of the Seaman Challenge require you to have plenty of money to buy a boat and a boating license. You can get a boating license by heading into Activities, choosing Licenses, and taking a quick boating license test. After getting your license and making some money, head into Assets, choose Shopping, and scroll through the boat vehicle dealer until you spot a boat worth at least $2,000,000. </p>

Some easy ways include marrying someone rich, getting inheritances from your parents, and working hard at your job until you get the money. You can also go a different, higher-paying career route, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-win-the-lottery-in-bitlife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">win the lottery</a>, or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-escape-prison-in-bitlife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resort to crime</a> if you need to.</p>

<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Many games these days tend to have a predictable and run-of-the-mill plot. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a unique and well-told narrative, but Sunset Visitor has taken that challenge and fired on all cylinders with its debut title<em>1000xRESIST</em>.</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">On the surface, <em>1000xRESIST</em> is a story about surviving an apocalyptic alien incursion. But in unraveling its approximately 1,000-year timeline, <em>1000xRESIST</em> delves into numerous meaningful themes including family, humanistic nature, and the adaptivity of the mind. I even learned a thing or two about myself along the way. It’s still a sci-fi tale, but it’s not afraid to get a bit deep as the story unfolds.</p>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Those expecting intense or difficult gameplay in any form won’t find it here. In fact, for the most part, <em>1000xRESIST</em> is mostly an adventure game with some light gameplay elements sprinkled throughout. But those elements serve the exact purpose you’d hope for in an experience like 1000xRESIST: to enhance the narrative. After experiencing this roughly 15-hour journey, I don’t think I’d want it any other way.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="1000xRESIST Out Now Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISmiWUpiDs4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>1000xRESIST</em> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675830/1000xRESIST/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a></strong> <strong>[reviewed], Switch)<br>Developer:&nbsp;Sunset Visitor<br>Publisher: Fellow Traveller<br>Released: May 9, 2024<br>MSRP: $19.99</strong></p>
 <h2 id="h-game-of-clones" data-injectable="false">Game of Clones</h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">The story of 1000xRESIST starts over 1,000 years after an alien species known as The Occupants visits Earth, bringing with it a weapon; a disease that leads to the near-extinction of the human race. The disease is brutal. People start to cry, before all their bodily fluids are eventually forcefully expunged from their bodies. Certainly not a pleasant end for humankind.</p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="858" data-injectable="true">A group of six sister clones, all named after their purpose—Principal, Knower, Fixer, Healer, Bang Bang Fire, and Watcher—reside in an underground bunker serving their creator, the ALLMOTHER. We play as the Watcher, who has the especially unique role of being able to observe the memories of the ALLMOTHER through a process called Communion. We can observe the memories and learn more about life before the Occupants arrived, as well as the last 1,000 years since they got to Earth. </p>
 <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">At the time of the Occupant invasion, ALLMOTHER—whose name was Iris—was in high school. In your first communion as Watcher, you experience the trials and tribulations of Iris, going about her high school life. The Occupants appear and the disease starts infecting everyone at her school, except her. But before you can finish your first Communion, Fixer finds a way to interfere with the memory; to alert you that things in the bunker, and more specifically with ALLMOTHER, may not be as they seem.</p>
 <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">For a narrative-driven experience like <em>1000xRESIST</em>, the story is the most important part. And thankfully the story here does not disappoint. <em>1000xRESIST</em> utilizes a variety of forms throughout the telling of its story, mixing laughs, cries, scares, and confusion. The early chapters drip-feed you enough to satiate your appetite for answers, while also prompting more questions about what’s going on in this world. In the end, you get the answers to most of the questions, and the unanswered parts feel intended for the player to fill in the cracks with their own theories.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="1000xRESIST Review Screenshot 2" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-2.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-clonesome-dove" data-injectable="false">Clonesome Dove</h2> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">I usually struggle a bit getting through dialogue-heavy games. It’s not that I don’t like them. Who doesn’t love a good story? But whether I want to or not, I eventually find my mind wandering a bit. <em>1000xRESIST</em> finds multiple ways to prevent that from happening. </p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">From a story perspective, there are tons of comical laughs and subtle third-wall-breaking segments that keep it feeling fresh. Sunset Visitor’s writing had me genuinely looking forward to each and every line. To make it even better, each line of dialogue from every character is fully voiced with a superb cast of voice acting whose stellar performances only make the narrative even more surreal.</p>
 <p data-characters="675" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Then there’s the gameplay. For most of the game, each chapter goes through a similar cadence. You’ll start in the underground bunker in the present day. You’ll walk around and talk with the other sisters, then perform a Communion where you experience a memory of Iris. During the Communion, you’ll walk around solving very light puzzles with a handy technological device that allows you to jump forward and backward through various times on demand. For example, you may want to enter a room that’s blocked off in your current time. You can simply jump to another time where the entrance is open, walk in, and then jump back to your current time.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">None of the puzzles are difficult in any regard, and mostly just serve as a fun little gameplay element between the storytelling. There are also several <em>Gravity</em> <em>Rush</em>-style segments where you must look around you and right-click on specific highlighted points of the area you are in, jumping from one to another to quickly climb to high areas or cover larger distances quickly.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">Gameplay is supplemental to the actual drive here, to progress the story and explore the narrative in detail. You can’t fail or get a game over screen, and you probably won’t find yourself searching for a difficult puzzle solution on your phone or anything like that. But it does offer a nice change of pace between the sometimes hard-hitting narrative at play.</p>

The character design of all of the sisters is really well done. Each sister’s namesake describes their purpose in the Guarden, which also molds their personality based on what they are tasked with doing in the bunker.</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">You’ll only scratch the surface at the start. Each sister will start to open up and show you more and more of their personality as you progress through <em>1000xRESIST</em>. Even though the sisters are clones, they all have their own personalities. It’s a lineup of characters I didn’t expect to care much for when I first met them, but by the end, I appreciated each of them for different reasons.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-sword-in-the-clone" data-injectable="false">The Sword in the Clone</h2> <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Though small in the grand scheme of things, there are some minor issues I had with <em>1000xRESIST</em>. First is how the save system works. At the end of each chapter, you’re presented with the option to save. However, you can also save during the game as well—right in the middle of the chapter, for example—as long as you aren’t currently in a dialogue segment. Simply open the menu and click Save Game. But that save doesn’t seem to save the actual point you’re at. Instead, it just creates a save point at the beginning of that chapter.</p>
 <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">The first time I experienced this, I had no clue. I was a couple of hours into a chapter, nearing the end, when suddenly I had something come up and had to step away for a while. I went into the menu and saved my game, only to come back later, and upon loading the save had to start over at the beginning of the chapter. I tried this several more times just to see if it was a fluke, but every save just loaded at the beginning of its respective chapter. It’s an unclear option that could lead to some annoyances for players taking a break.</p>
 <p data-characters="723" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">I also had a bit of frustration trying to navigate the Guarden, which you spend a lot of time in. It’s pretty massive in size, which is important, seeing as it’s the last bastion of the apocalypse. But you only get a simple compass-style indicator at the top of your map to find certain characters to interact with. Even after exploring the corridors and multiple levels of the Guarden throughout my 15-ish hour playthrough, I still found myself running around lost, trying to figure out how to get somewhere due to the somewhat maze-like flow of it. It’s a cool setting and I can certainly appreciate the detail that went into it, but traversing it (which you will do often) can be quite a pain at times.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-4.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-4.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-4.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-4.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000xRESIST-Review-Screenshot-4.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-twilight-clone" data-injectable="false">The Twilight Clone</h2> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true"><em>1000xRESIST</em> is a narrative masterpiece. It’s a testament that games can be light on the gameplay, but still tell a story that rivals all other types of media if done properly. It’s <a href="https://twitter.com/1000xResist/status/1787939091515899966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clear</a> that Sunset Visitor drew inspiration from other sci-fi story-heavy titles like <em>NieR: Automata</em>. Narratively,<em> 1000xRESIST </em>holds its own and tells a captivating, intriguing, and thought-provoking story, paying homage to the titles that inspired it as opposed to relying on them.</p>
 <p data-characters="523" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="false">If you enjoy a good story that can make you laugh one minute, hold back tears the next, then audibly mumble “WTF?” right after that, do yourself a favor, and check out<em>1000xRESIST</em>. I’m incredibly impressed with Sunset Visitor’s ability to tell a story with its debut title. It’s one that will stick with me for a while, and I’ve already caught myself still thinking about it, despite having finished it a few days ago. I can’t wait to see what Sunset Visitor does next. Hekki ALLMO.</p>

<p data-characters="258" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">What’s a survival horror game without a magnum that you’ll never fire a single time because there might be an even bigger, badder boss in the next room? Crow Country has its very own boss-killer, and you can get it about midway through the game. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">There’s only one prerequisite item: the <strong>silver key</strong>. If you don’t have this yet, then there are actually <em>several </em>prerequisite items, but at the risk of spoiling the experience, you can revisit this guide once you’ve got your hands on it to get your shiny new gun as soon as possible.</p> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">First, head over to the Gift Shop, located just off the main square:</p> <figure data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-gift-shop-map.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Inside, you’ll find several items for sale, each of which you can inspect to check the price. Near the cash register at the back of the shop is a note from Mr. Crow himself, which lists several items he’s planning on picking out for his daughter Natalie. By adding the price of these items and entering the result, <strong>$19.75</strong>, into the register, we’ll claim our prize:</p> <ol data-found-items="3" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true"> <li>Haunted Hilltop stuffed toy – $5.50</li> <li>Classic Crow Country rubber doll – $10.00</li> <li>Fairytale Town action figure – $4.25</li> </ol>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">The items aren’t labeled exactly as they appear in the shop, and there are many to choose from, so some deductive reasoning goes a long way in finding the right ones. Once you have your hands on the magnum, all that’s left is to find some ammo for it. And that’s a puzzle even I’ve struggled with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="212" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During my time playing <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, I’ve overcome a lot of anxiety. Not just in the game but also outside of it, and certain things that I’ve experienced within Eorzea have transferred into real life.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Of course,, the story and characters stay with me; their words echo around my mind during times when I’m struggling. But things that I’ve managed to achieve during my game time have given me pause for thought in the real world as well. If I can overcome things that terrify me and push me in Eorzea, surely I can push myself in real life.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">I’ve already talked about my experience <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/overcoming-tank-anxiety-in-ffxiv-made-me-a-better-player-and-a-dark-knight-main/">overcoming tank anxiety</a> in <em>FFXIV</em> before going on to be a Dark Knight main. That experience, in a strange way, taught me about taking life by the horns and doing things that push your boundaries. Healing, on the other hand, is something that I once found truly terrifying and had zero confidence doing.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Playing as a White Mage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-2.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Except now, all of my healer jobs are sitting at level 90, and I’m actually excited to increase them all to level 100 when Dawntrail drops at the end of June. I’m more than happy to jump into any content as a healer, though I might fumble my buttons to start with if it’s been a while. Getting to this point, though, was not easy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">I actually started playing <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> as a healer. A Conjurer, to be precise. The trouble was, I had never played an MMO before and I had no idea that playing that job would place me in a party as the healer for everyone else involved. The green icon didn’t give me any clues, either. Like I said, I had no idea what I was doing. I didn’t even take the hint when I started to gain healing spells, simply thinking, “well, that might come in useful one day,” while going about my day using Stone and Aero to take down foes I encountered, like an idiot.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Playing as a White Mage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-1.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="763" data-injectable="true">It wasn’t until I queued, on my own, for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-final-fantasy-xiv-dungeons-ranked/">Sashtasha</a> that I discovered the weight that I’d taken upon myself by choosing the Conjurer class. I didn’t know I was supposed to be healing, I didn’t know that was my role, but it quickly dawned on me when the party died and everyone blamed me. I’m not ashamed to admit that I dropped the dungeon and all but ran to the first city-state on the teleport list to pick up a new class, which ended up being Rogue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">And so it went on, I leveled Rogue and all of my other DPS classes, including ones which unlock later like Samurai and Dancer. My Conjurer remained at around level 19 for over a year, untouched and feared. Then, and if you’ve read my tank anxiety article, you’ll know what’s coming: my FC at the time got involved and pushed me to pick up Conjurer again. Thankfully, this was before the tanking experience, and they were much gentler with me than they went on to be with the whole Paglth’an debacle.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="White Mage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/white-mage-3.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="799" data-injectable="true">It started with FATEs, something that I could do without worrying too much about those around me. We ran up and down Western La Noscea, taking on every FATE we encountered, which not only gave me experience but also levels and new spells to go with them. I very slowly started to actually heal the people around me, though learning how to juggle DPS and healing was definitely a learning curve. Pretty soon, I was level 30 and able to go and pick up my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-equip-soul-crystal-job-stone-in-ffxiv/">Job Stone</a>, turning myself into a White Mage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">By this point, the notion of healing wasn’t horrifically scary to me anymore, though I was far from good at it. But I still avoided it as much as I could. Eventually, I left that FC for one reason or another and set out on my own for a long time, not healing but also not fearful of it, until I saw someone with a specific weapon which I absolutely fell in love with — Canopus Lux.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Canopus Lux Astrologian weapon in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-lux-1.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">This weapon is beautiful; there’s no denying that. Like the Amaro mount, which eventually drove me to tanking, this weapon was the driving force behind my finally overcoming the barrier that was keeping me from healing—my own lack of confidence.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">And I did. I swallowed my pride, I picked up Astrologian, and I apologized to everyone I ended up with in a dungeon, telling them that they would likely die and they were welcome to kick me if they wanted to. I wasn’t griefing, I was just terrible at healing. Those first dungeons were hard, but I never got kicked. Like with my tanking journey, most people were very understanding, and some even gave incredibly helpful advice. Slowly, I gained confidence, but also skill.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Manderville Sage weapons in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-2.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="798" data-injectable="true">Eventually, I started to crave the rush that healing gave me. I’m not saying that I enjoy having people’s lives in my hands, but I enjoy being able to keep people alive and prolonging the battle long enough to win. It’s a thrill, and I’ve since learned that, like tanking, the different healing Jobs aren’t all that dissimilar to each other. Of course, each has its own nuances, but they follow the same pattern – if people are dying, you heal. If people are good, you do DPS.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">With all that said, I’m never going to be a particularly good healer. I know what I’m doing, and I can keep people alive while doing some damage, but I still get confused between green and pink cards while playing Astrologian (I’m not looking forward to having to relearn the Job after its Dawntrail overhaul), I still accidentally spam Cure sometimes when playing White Mage and I’ll admit that I fall into the trap of over-reliance on Holy.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Playing as Sage in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sage-1.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">Sage is my strongest healer, and if I have to heal, it’s the Job I will always choose. If you asked me to play Astrologian or White Mage right now, I’d have to ask for 10 minutes with a training dummy to figure out what I was doing, and if you wanted me to play Scholar, I’d be clueless because I’ve always leveled it through Summoner. Like I said, I’m not a good ‘all-around’ healer, but if you want a Sage, I can do that for you.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">I also introduced my fiancé to Sage, which is now his main Job alongside my Dark Knight. He, too, was terrified of healing, but thanks to my own experience overcoming that fear, I could help him overcome it, too. I’ve helped others beside him, as well, thanks to my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-become-an-ffxiv-mentor-and-unlock-the-mentor-roulette/">Mentor</a> status. Talking of which, I was playing as a healer when I finally gained enough Commendations to pick up the crown, which makes the role pretty special to me.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-1_f69630.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Playing as Astrologian in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-1_f69630.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-1_f69630.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-1_f69630.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/astro-1_f69630.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="892" data-injectable="true">Now, how has all this helped me in the real world? Well, I’ve learned that while new things might be scary at first, there’s a lot of enjoyment that can be gained through learning how to do something. Gaining the confidence to try and ultimately do pretty well at something that absolutely terrified me in <em>FFXIV</em> showed me that learning something new doesn’t have to be something that I fear. I don’t need to shy away from something just because I don’t fully understand it. Figuring out how to do something isn’t just rewarding, but the experience of learning itself can be fun.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">While my healing experience in <em>FFXIV</em> hasn’t caused me to go out and train to be a doctor in real life, it has given me a new perspective. I stopped shying away from bettering myself and took on training courses and new opportunities, including writing, which previously scared me to death.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="false">Fear is natural, but it doesn’t have to define your actions, and you shouldn’t let it. What was it that Eleanor Roosevelt said? “Do one thing every day that scares you”. Your comfort zone may be cozy, but going beyond it is what helps us to grow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Grubb has now <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1789383666797281690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that he also heard Perfect Dark might be shown at the Xbox Games Showcase. Also, he slightly backtracked from his previous statement about the game's rough state, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1789388582802587990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarifying</a> that it was just one developer feeling that way and that <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1789383666797281690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's not uncommon during development</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Following Xbox's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close down three studios</a> (Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games) and roll Roundhouse Studios into ZeniMax Online, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-in-very-rough-state-rumor-redfall-big-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Grubb's rumor</a> that the Perfect Dark reboot was in rough waters made things look even more dire for Xbox fans.</p>
<p>Grubb said the game hasn't really come together in any meaningful way, even after experienced studio Crystal Dynamics (Tomb Raider) <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-a-collaborative-effort-between-the-initiative-and-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially partnered with The Initiative</a> in September 2021. Needless to say, that didn't sound very enticing to anyone interested in the reboot of the stealth first-person shooter game series.</p>
<p>Today, though, fellow insider Nate the Hate countered Grubb's report on the topic. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rygk-rcOogM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">During the latest episode of Spawncast's DirectXbox</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>If it doesn't show next month, I think you could begin to have just some conversation about what is happening with the game, but I wouldn't sound any alarms until the end of the year. If we go the entire year without seeing Perfect Dark in any form, then I think that conversation of concern has to come up, but at this point, I fully expect that we will see Perfect Dark next month and that some of the more recent rumors may have been outdated information perhaps. I have been hearing things this week that Perfect Dark is not in that bad of a state.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, Grubb was not the only insider to speak in a pessimistic fashion of this reboot recently. Even <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jeff-grubb-on-perfect-dark-it-sounds-like-its-in-a-very-rough-state-it-doesnt-sound-like-its-really-come-together-in-any-way.864672/post-122651448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miller Ross</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1787973283486515599" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Robertson</a>, and VG247's <a href="https://twitter.com/APZonerunner/status/1787865521251139813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Donaldson</a> shared negative rumblings.</p>
<p>If Perfect Dark does show up on the Xbox Games Showcase slated for June 9, it better be very good. As MIDiA Research Games Analyst Rhys Elliott put it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-likely-sees-studio-closures-as-eggs-broken-to-make-omelet-situation-an-impressive-showcase-could-mostly-eclipse-anger-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">while talking to Wccftech</a>, Microsoft desperately needs a strong showing to win back at least some of the many disgruntled fans.</p>

The game is designed to challenge you with puzzles you won’t understand or even find until you’ve completed other tasks elsewhere. However, one important note players are sharing as they discover it is that you can mark the map to give yourself pointers for areas where you’ve still got something to do. </p>

You can use a pencil to draw on the map, but you can also find an item called The Stamp. <strong>The Stamp allows you to stamp icons on Animal Well’s map to help you remember bosses, enemies, or just something you noticed that might be important later.</strong> </p>
 <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">You’ll find The Stamp up and to the left from where you found the map. Climb the ladders in the room with the green penguins and head left to find a room with four doors. The Stamp is in the chest you find in this room.</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">The game is built so that if you get stuck on certain parts of it, such as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-chameleon-boss-in-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chameleon boss</a>, you can come back later because there’s so much else you could be doing or a new area to explore at the same time. This type of open-ended gameplay really benefits from the map-marking mechanics because you’re encouraged to get out there and go anywhere. </p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><em>Animal Well</em>‘s world is dense and surprisingly large by the time you’ve explored most of it. The map seems to go on and on, even when you think you’ve found every secret, item, and collectible. Marking the map makes your life so much easier in the long run because you can open it and instantly see areas you haven’t explored or where you noticed something you need to return to. </p>

I did, and when I saw others using it, I had to put the game down, cradle my head in my hands, and let the waves of emotion, mostly humiliation, wash over me before I could get back to exploring. </p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="false">Map markers were a great help when it came to noting the parts of rooms with openings to other rooms that I couldn’t reach with my current equipment. Items you acquire after a certain point allow you to explore previously unreachable areas, so having these marked made my next session of exploration so much easier. </p>

            <p>Sony and Lego are collaborating on a "well-known" IP, and rumour has it, it's Guerilla's Horizon franchise.</p>
<p>Earlier today, noted leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005">Kurakasis</a> suggested that "Sony is preparing something in collaboration with Lego", adding that it was "related" to a well-known series and that an announcement is "expected soon".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Digital Foundry takes a deep dive into Phantom Liberty's visuals in their roundtable.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv9SLtojkTU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Tom Henderson – a "Tier 1 / very reliable source" as determined by the Gaming Leaks and Rumours <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cpek98/kurakasis_sony_and_lego_are_planning_to_announce/">subreddit</a> community – chimed in to concur with Kurakasis' claim, cheekily adding "an announcement is on the horizon".</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sony is preparing something in cooperation with LEGO, it is related to their well-known IP, the announcement is expected soon</p><p>I'm trying to find more details</p></div>— Kurakasis (@Kurakasis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>In an additional tweet, Henderson said he wasn't "particularly fond" of the "I know something, and you don't obligatory vague insider BS" and clarified his tease with: "But from what I know, there's a Lego Horizon trailer that's ready to go".</p>
<p>Interestingly, Henderson also added: "It also suggests that the rumours of a showcase soon are accurate".</p> 
<p>As for whether this refers to a Lego-ified Horizon game or Lego sets based upon Guerilla's franchise remains unclear for now, but hopefully we'll find out more at the not-yet-confirmed State of Play later this month. Watch this space.</p>
<p>"There are issues to address then, but ultimately, Horizon Forbidden West has landed in fine form on PC (with a new patch addressing HDR issues) and we can highly recommend it," Digital Foundry's Alex said when he put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-forbidden-west-the-best-pc-settings-look-a-lot-like-guerrillas-choices-for-playstation-5">Horizon Forbidden West through its paces when it released earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The days when <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s player base was mainly concerned with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-blue-laser-remarks-fuel-speculation-of-imminent-new-enemy-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spooky in-game events</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-automatons-take-things-to-the-next-level-with-massive-at-at-weapon-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise content drops</a> are now—at least temporarily—in the past. These in-universe problems have been replaced by more substantial problems, and the sheer quality and usability of new content is one of them.</p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">To be more specific, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is still reeling from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-bringing-back-mandatory-playstation-accounts-for-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent PlayStation Network account situation</a>, which left the community fragmented and the game unpurchasable in almost 200 countries. Even Arrowhead Games CEO Johan Pilestedt believes that <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s balancing is now in a spot of bother, saying that he understands why players might feel like “<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/despite-a-hefty-nerf-the-quasar-cannon-is-still-the-best-helldivers-2-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every</a> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-eruptor-nerf-was-deliberate-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time</a> someone finds <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-community-bemoans-railgun-changes-due-to-a-particularly-annoying-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something fun</a>, the fun is removed.”</p>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">These problems, when put together, don’t paint an awfully pretty picture. In some respects, the situation is fairly dire, albeit one would still be hard-pressed to call it unfixable. Arrowhead will need to respond to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cozzpy/what_youre_all_witnessing_here_is_burnout_this_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the community’s concerns</a> sooner or later, however, and it’s obvious which option would be preferable.</p> <figure data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-arrowhead-games-may-be-trying-to-do-too-much-with-helldivers-2-s-content-pipeline" data-injectable="false">Arrowhead Games may be trying to do too much with Helldivers 2’s content pipeline</h2> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">Right off the bat, it should be obvious that we’ve got no direct hands-on insight into Arrowhead Games’ production pipeline, and anything stated in the next couple of sections is essentially informed conjecture. However, I cannot shake the feeling that Arrowhead is simply trying to juggle too many balls at the same time.</p> <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="884" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-season-pass-explained-how-does-premium-warbond-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Premium Warbonds are coming in at a brisk pace</a>: one a month, containing almost half a dozen weapons and gear that often come with all-new features and functionality. In between, Arrowhead has also maintained a steady supply of engaging stealth releases, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/abandoned-usable-mechs-now-spawn-on-helldivers-2s-tien-kwan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechs</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-terminids-can-now-officially-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mutated enemies</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-how-to-airburst-rocket-launcher-educates-players-on-the-dos-and-donts-of-the-latest-stratagem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Stratagems</a>, with the end result being a live-service experience where there’s always something new going on. Worst-case scenario, the community “only” gets a Major Order to contend with, with an enemy mutator thrown in for good measure.</p>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Obviously, this whole schtick is a non-trivial development setup. Pushing <em>so much</em> content live so often is absolutely taking a toll on the developers, this way or the other, and the community is all but certain that this is why the subjective quality of the recent content releases hasn’t been stellar.</p> <figure data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="650" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true">It’s entirely possible that the studio has prepared dozens of weapons, armor sets, Stratagems, and features in the years preceding Helldivers 2’s release, and it’s only now going through the motions pushing it all live. Even if this really is the case, though, the brisk release pipeline is having an effect on Helldivers 2’s community through a death by a thousand cuts. The latest Polar Patriot Warbond, for example, is <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cnsu6i/polar_patriots_warbond_now_available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overall a disappointment</a> outside of the new incendiary contact grenade and a new sidearm. There’s reason to believe that some of its offerings were balanced for an entirely different combat sandbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">I’ll concede that this may be the wrong takeaway, depending on how Arrowhead is handling balancing in the backend, but the surface-level conclusion is that the combat sandbox grew too plentiful and varied in too short a time for the balancing team to keep up with everything in an appropriate manner. This, in turn, has resulted in a situation where there’s a <em>massive</em> disconnect between Arrowhead and the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community when it comes to balance, in particular.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Balancing has become a sore topic in the Helldivers 2 community. In fact, there’s been a <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cobatg/developers_want_a_poll_release_warbonds_monthly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-insignificant amount of friction</a> between vocal players and Arrowhead developers on the game’s Discord. As of right now, it’s not clear what the studio will do next and whether it aims to alleviate the onset of issues in the short term at all.</p>
 <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Pilestedt’s apparent agreement with <em>Helldivers 2</em> players that the studio has taken things too far is a good sign, at the very least. None of the problems so far are beyond fixing. Slowing down the release of new content and polishing things up would be a major boon to the game at large, from a layperson’s point of view. The vast majority of Helldivers 2’s currently underperforming gear could be tweaked back into relevance relatively easily, even without touching its literal damage output. Pilestedt himself said this is the way to go. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A bit too much balancing using damage as well instead of other measures such as recoil, reload speeds, accuracy, projectile speeds and equip speeds. Just tweaking damage numbers is a blunt tool.</p>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1788292885651001491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">The question we should all be asking is whether this is an option for Arrowhead from the perspective of contractual obligations with Sony, the publisher. It’s entirely possible that Arrowhead has to keep pushing out monthly Premium Warbonds. If that’s the case, balancing will only become more problematic as we receive 3-4 all-new weapons every single month.</p>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">Just to put that into perspective, if <em>Helldivers 2</em> keeps up its currently established content scheduling, this means the game will have received all of the following items in a single year of live-service support:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false"> <li>48 new weapons</li> <li>12 new grenades</li> <li>12 new Boosters</li> </ul> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">It’s just short of mind-boggling, really. Is this level of continued support feasible if Arrowhead wants to keep <em>all</em> of these items fair, fun to use, and relatively balanced among each other? </p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">For what it’s worth, it’s all but obvious that Arrowhead Games <em>knows</em> this can’t go on as it currently stands. Something is going to have to give, and either the community continues to grow more unhappy as new items are released in a subpar state, or the studio takes a step back to slow things down and focus more on quality rather than quantity.</p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">There’s another layer to this problem, too: can a live-service title afford to slow down or postpone its content pipeline? Is the community going to stick around if a Warbond misses its scheduled release date once, twice, or thrice? Or is everyone going to move on to the next flavor of the month?</p>
 <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">I do feel that <em>Helldivers 2</em> has more staying power than that. The game could easily support a more forgiving content release pipeline, with a substantially larger balancing buffer than just a month’s worth of attention. Arrowhead Games certainly has what it takes to keep this game on the straight and narrow, but it’s going to take some rethinking of how to deal with it as it balloons to its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-helldivers-content-is-missing-from-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true, gargantuan proportions</a>. </p>
