            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="61ffe6b0cd8e7"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61ffe6b0cd8e7/nintendo-switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the introduction of the OLED model, there's been an Ethernet port built into the dock of Nintendo's flagship Switch, and that continued this year with Switch 2. If you're after the fastest download speeds or you play competitive online games while docked to your TV, you may benefit from wiring up your dock to your router directly.</p>
<p>However, since launch back in June, we've seen reports of players having issues with wired internet connections. Some point to the Realtek port as the culprit, others think it's a specific firmware or software glitch, or a USB-C-related handshake issue where something periodically goes awry. But whatever the reason, there seems to be a group for whom Switch 2's Ethernet port just isn't functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Asking around the NL office, it's blank faces, (un)fortunately. Either a wireless connection is sufficient and we haven't ever bothered wiring up the dock, or we just haven't experienced any issues.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/ethernet_port_on_switch_2_docks_failing_for_many_people">our forums</a> and <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/some-switch-2-ethernet-docks-are-malfunctioning.14103/">the wider internet</a> are filled with people who have had issues. Some have sent their docks back to Nintendo with varying degrees of success; others have found that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l6q47u/comment/n1rse3p">connecting their phones via a USB cable</a> somehow resets the chip and managed to get their Ethernet back up and running, if only temporarily.</p>

<p>Naturally, Nintendo has its error codes and <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68592">related pages</a>, but assuming that using a different Ethernet cable doesn't solve your problem, opening up a report ticket with Nintendo is the only option they're offering.</p>
<p>Obviously, this issue will be frustrating if it impacts you, but we're keen to get a sense of just how many people this is affecting. As with any electronic device, there'll be a percentage of failures or manufacturing faults that crop up that'll need attention, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">10.36 million people</a> (and counting) picking up a Switch 2 in the first few months, there are bound to be some malfunctioning units - but how widespread is the problem?</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll below if you've experienced any issues with a wired internet connection - and if / how you've solved the problem.</p>

		<p>I’ve come down with some kind of malady this weekend, presumably from all the shared spaces that I had on trains to and from Paris a few days ago. That’s making the prospect of battling through the rest of the Black Ops 7 campaign a bit of a tricky one to psyche myself up for, so I’ve booted up Metroid Prime Remastered to get into the groove ahead of Metroid Prime 4. It’s really rather good with the modern controls.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-port-fast-charger-pack-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-prices-each-unit-five-times-lower-than-apple-2000644466</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-dual-port-fast-charger-pack-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-prices-each-unit-five-times-lower-than-apple.1354573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger is a $19 single-port affair that doesn’t include any cables in the box. Anker’s solution flips that equation entirely, with two chargers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">sporting dual-ports apiece, plus two included USB-C cables, all for just $12 on Amazon right now</a>. That’s down from the regular $18 price and an all-time low for this bundle. You’re essentially getting five times the charging capability for less than what Apple charges for their basic single-port adapter, and you won’t need to hunt down cables separately since Anker includes <strong>two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> in the package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual-Port Flexibility Changes Your Charging Setup</h2>
<p>Each charger <strong>has both a USB-C and a USB-A port,</strong> each of which works simultaneously, enabling you to charge two devices from a single wall outlet. The maximum output of 20W is intelligently split when you charge two devices simultaneously, though when charging just one device through the USB-C port, you get the full 20W for fast charging speeds. This dual-port design is very convenient, especially for traveling when hotel rooms never seem to have enough outlets, or when everyone in your family has a different device that they need to charge in the same area.</p>



<p>This means the 20W of power delivery through <strong>USB-C charges an iPhone from zero to 50 percent in roughly 30 minutes</strong> – just like Apple’s own fast chargers-and it works across iPhone 15, 16 and 17 series models, iPad Pro, and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocol. For comparison, it would take older 5W chargers, which used to ship with iPhones, nearly two hours to reach that same 50 percent charge level.</p>



<p>Anker designed these chargers with compact form factors that <strong>keep them from blocking adjacent outlets on power strips or wall plates</strong>. The foldable prongs on the US version further make them more travel-friendly by removing the sharp edges that can snag on clothing or scratch other items in your bag. About the size of Apple’s standard charger, these easily slip into a laptop bag, purse, or jacket pocket without adding bulk.</p>
<p>The included safety features address common charging concerns through Anker’s proprietary protection system. Overvoltage protection prevents power surges or inconsistent electrical supplies from causing any damage and thus is important during international travels or when one has to use the electrical systems of older buildings. Monitoring temperature control means this charger will not overheat during a long session and can throttle power output in case temperatures rise above safe thresholds. Short-circuit protection provides protection against wiring faults that may otherwise damage connected devices.</p>
<p>Those <strong>two included 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables add a considerable value</strong> as quality USB-C cables usually cost $10-$15 each if you buy them separately. This 5-foot length is long enough to use your device comfortably while charging, unlike those frustratingly short 3-foot cables that make you sit right next to the outlet. These cables support the full 20W power delivery which means you are not bottlenecking the charging speed through some inferior cable.</p>
<p>That comes to $6 per complete charging setup when you buy two dual-port chargers plus two cables for $12, which is less than a third of what Apple asks for its base single-port adapter before cables. It gets even better because, with Apple, you would have to purchase the cables separately which will easily push the price tag north of $25 per charging setup if you were buying from Apple.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders.1354567/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first full day of Black Ops 7 is behind us. Its reception has been fairly mixed so far, but one thing that’s not up for debate is how Black Ops 7 has performed on Steam, especially compared to other big-time shooters right now, such as Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release means Treyarch has had back-to-back launches. Black Ops 6 was quite the success, but Black Ops 7 isn’t being as warmly received. Criticism has come its way due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Claims</a> and the fact that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>.</p>







<p>With so many eyes on Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders, it’s fair to say Black Ops 7 isn’t the shooter in the spotlight like it wants to be.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-falls-way-short-of-arc-raiders-amp-battlefield-6-on-steam">Black Ops 7 Falls Way Short Of ARC Raiders &amp; Battlefield 6 On Steam</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A good start for some. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s break this down for you. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield hit a 24-hour release day peak of <strong>747,440 players</strong>, whereas ARC Raiders managed a more than respectable <strong>264,673</strong>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is part of the whole ‘Call of Duty’ banner under SteamDB, making its numbers slightly inflated if anything. However, its 24-hour launch peak on November 14 hit a high of <strong>86,652 players</strong>.</p>







<p>It’s bad enough if you compare ARC Raider and Black Ops 7. When you do a direct comparison between Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, you need to stop the count! Worryingly for CoD, Battlefield 6 is still regularly hitting 200-250K, and ARC Raiders is growing stronger—consistently breaking 300K.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the weekend might give Black Ops 7 a boost, but it remains to be seen by how much. Even with Season 1 expected to be the biggest ever, for a franchise that regularly scoops the award for best-selling game of the year, this year might be a rude awakening for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Have you bought Black Ops 7? Or are you on either the Battlefield 6 or ARC Raiders hype train this year?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Given the history and prestige of The Legend of Zelda, a proper movie is something that’s needed. There’s also the biggest weight of expectation imaginable on its shoulders. So, anyone desperate for details on The Legend of Zelda movie might be interested to know that the first footage has reportedly leaked.</p>



<p>In 2023, we finally learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda was getting a movie</a>. It received a release date soon after, but it was inevitably <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a>—as all things are. After wondering where the movie had gone, it was rumored that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-filming-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie had seemingly started filming</a> in November 2025. Not long after, secret footage surfaced.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-video-leaks-appear-online">The Legend of Zelda Movie Video Leaks Appear Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a tough ask. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/josh.and.pine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">josh.and.pine</a> has shared several videos supposedly showing the first The Legend of Zelda Movie set leaks.</p>



<p>The video shows Link on set (in full Green Tunic) speaking to the crew. Soon after, we cut to the actress playing Zelda—and it also reveals that she’s wearing a blue outfit closer to the Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom look. A horse is being prepared, and it’s clearly wearing a patch with the classic Zelda logo in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCDMlDDq-q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, another leak from what appears to be the sme set has also been revealed. This time, it looks like an actual scene is taking place. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tonyolsenfilm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tonyolsenfilm</a> shared the other video, and it’s an extension of the first clip, only this time Zelda is briefly looking around before speaking to another Hylian.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>There have been some suggestions that the footage is AI. However, the action isn’t consistent with the usual AI tropes, such as scenery inconsistencies, the weird AI effect some videos have, and there aren’t any abnormal occurrences in the footage. This could also be a setup leak to promote the film and gain publicity through alleged leaks.</p>







<p>Either way, unless we hear otherwise, this does look like the first-ever The Legend of Zelda Movie footage. The costumes look good—although this incarnation of Zelda might upset some fans—and we know that filming is likely underway!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-length-mission-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-game-length-and-missions-list.1354549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is available to the world and, with a new game mode unlocking after completion of the campaign, it’s natural to ask about the length and how many missions there are to complete—and we have the answer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 makes some big changes to the campaign this year, introducing four-player co-op and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos to unlock</a>, giving players more to dig out from the experience.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what the full length of the Black Ops 7 campaign is and want to know how many missions there are to churn through, we’ve got all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">How Long to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big names. Image via Activsion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Full completion of the main story in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign takes around five hours to complete, though this can be longer.</strong></p>



<p>If you are playing the campaign solo, completion time will be longer as progress will be harder and therefore slower. If you want to blitz through the campaign as quickly as possible, it’s highly recommended that you gather a squad to help push through the hordes of enemies more quickly.</p>



<p>Campaign completion will also take longer if you’re hunting down all of the Intel scattered in the game, or if you’re farming for the exclusive Camos. If you’re doing the latter, however, I recommend you hold off until you complete the campaign and unlock the Endgame mode.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign">How Many Missions in Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 11 total missions in the Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign, not including the Endgame mode, which you will be automatically entered into for the first time when the campaign is complete.</strong></p>



<p>Each mission is unlocked periodically, fleshing out the main story, though it’s a bit of a fever trip jumping to different locations and years, so don’t worry if you’re struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>Many of the missions begin in an open-world environment in Avalon, but there are markers to follow so you won’t get lost.</p>



<p>A full list of the missions in the Black Ops 7 campaign is below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Inside</li>



<li>Distortion</li>



<li>Escalation</li>



<li>Disruption</li>



<li>Collapse</li>



<li>Fracture</li>



<li>Quarantine</li>



<li>Suppression</li>



<li>Breakpoint</li>



<li>Containment</li>
</ol>

<figure data-uuid="1752ef6450e0d"><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1752ef6450e0d/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you can turn your attention away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> for one moment, it seems we might have the very first leak from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>The Legend of Zelda Movie</strong></a> set.</p>
<p>While very little has been revealed about the film so far, it was confirmed earlier this month that the live-action is officially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">"in production" in New Zealand</a>. Now, in an update this week, footage has supposedly emerged of the production, including some clips featuring cast members and the film crew.</p>
<p>This is where this rumour possibly enters <strong>spoiler territory</strong>, so if you don't want any surprises ahead of official updates, navigate away from this page now. Right, with the spoiler warning out of the way, the first video that's been uploaded on Instagram shows two characters in a forest, surrounded by horses (with one horse equipped with some gear featuring what looks to be the Hylian Crest).</p>

<p>The first actor is believed to be Bo Bragason as Zelda, who is dressed in an outfit that looks similar to her clothing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, and the second actor (who we haven't heard about up until now) is apparently the Aussie and Tibetan actress Dichen Lachman, known for her current role in the Apple TV+ exclusive, Severance. She's also previously worked with director Wes Ball on Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.</p>
<p>As for who she is playing? Based on the footage, fans are already convinced she'll be Impa. Long-time Zelda players will know Impa is a recurring character in the Zelda series, who has been depicted as the bodyguard and mentor of the Princess.</p>
<p>The second scene doing the rounds looks to feature an older version of the series' protagonist Link in his green tunic, which he has appeared in across multiple games, including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess</a>. The footage in this upload even shows him putting on a cloak, and some fans think his horse Epona is also on display in the other clip.</p>

<p>We'd be surprised if the original clips stay up if they are the real deal. Of course, for now, it's probably best to treat this supposed leak as a rumour, but we will say the footage certainly looks the part, and casting someone from across the ditch (<em>aka Australia</em>) would check out, given the location of the production.</p>
<p>Apart from Zelda's casting, the only other actor officially confirmed for the Legend of Zelda Movie is Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. As for the story, some basic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">descriptions have popped up online</a>, but that's about it. This live-action film is currently scheduled to arrive in cinemas in <strong>May 2027</strong>, and you can find out more about it in our guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>This week has been surprisingly busy, huh?

<p>Now, with that out of the way, let's see what we're getting up to this weekend...</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Still lots of Resident Evil this weekend. I'm playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> again, which is comfortably one of my least favourite entries. It's still a good time, mind you, if only because the developers basically looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and said "hey, let's just do that again!". So the basics are solid.</p>
<p>I've been dipping back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> recently too, and it's really quite fun. I've even grown somewhat fond of free-roam mode. Bonkers.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I finally bit the bullet and bought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. I hope you’re happy. I know that I certainly won’t be, when I arrive back on Monday morning having spent 15+ hours getting overly emotionally-invested in a fictional frog wizard.</p>
<p>This game looks like it will scratch such an itch for me, so brace for ‘Jim becoming increasingly insufferable’ in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>The end-of-the-year release rush has begun! This will be my first time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> so I am quite eager to jump back into the streets of Kamurochō. Same applies for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a>. Great progress last week in with both Prometheus and Chronos defeated at long last. But of course Melinöe’s journey is not over yet… and neither is Princess Zelda’s in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> where I hope to clear Chapter 4 over this weekend.</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. I wasn’t quite sure this would ever get out of development hell and despite the lack of physical edition I dived head-first into it. I am rather surprised with the story mode because it is everything a current gen Pokémon game should be. Of course the over-the-top “Captain Tsubasa” style football (“soccer” for our American readers in the audience) action is where its at! Well played Level-5!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-server-capacity-tripled-for-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-tripled-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-server-capacity-ahead-of-1-0-release.1354528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest issues that plagues Escape from Tarkov players every time there’s a new update is server queues. The game suffers under the weight of incoming players, and those same players feel that burn. From lengthy queue times to network instability, Tarkov’s servers often crumble around a wipe or new major update.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has well and truly prepared for that ahead of the game’s 1.0 release, dropping later today. In an episode of Tarkov TV, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s server capacity has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of the release.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-major-networking-issues-eliminated">Tarkov’s Major Networking Issues Eliminated</h2>



<p>It’s a huge time for Escape from Tarkov. The game is finally graduating from the beta state it has sat in for almost eight years, becoming a full release and landing on Steam, amongst other things. The super-sized update introduces a new map, a non-linear campaign, fresh weapons, and more than 1,000 bug fixes.</p>



<p>In the most recent episode <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Tarkov TV</a>, Nikita also confirmed that a huge investment has been made in the game’s server capacity and infrastructure, and that the server makeup has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of launch.</p>



<p>This was preceded by a tongue-in-cheek reference by Nikita that begged players not to ‘overload their servers, please.’</p>







<p>Every time a major update has hit the Escape from Tarkov ecosystem, it has led to massive server queues and instability, placated only by users inevitably drifting away because of those issues.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update of Escape from Tarkov arrives after more than a decade of development, which has seen the face of the spearhead extraction shooter evolve numerous times.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mark Rubin Said Ubisoft Did NOT Cancel Splinter Cell to Make XDefiant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mark-rubin-splinter-cell-ubisoft-xdefiant/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-rubin-said-ubisoft-did-not-cancel-splinter-cell-to-make-xdefiant.1354525/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, it was suggested that Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was canceled before it saw the light of day. This tidbit came from Nick Herman, the co-founder of AdHoc Studio, the creator of the recent title ‘Dispatch’, starring Aaron Paul. Herman stressed that he left Ubisoft after the project was canceled and opened a new studio, AdHoc, in 2018.</p>



<p>However, Mark Rubin, who is best known as the executive producer on the failed arena shooter, XDefiant, took to social media to refute claims that his team was making Splinter Cell and was ordered to pivot and focus instead on XDefiant.</p>







<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-did-not-become-xdefiant">Splinter Cell Did Not Become XDefiant</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Mark Rubin stressed that a recent rumor published first by Bloomberg is <strong>not true</strong>. This rumor suggests that Ubisoft was working on Splinter Cell but ‘switched’ to XDefiant. Rubin categorically denies that it was the case, stating that they were working on a game for a year, but the team was ‘struggling to find the fun.’</p>



<p>He then pushed the point again that it ‘was NOT a Splinter Cell game.’</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full quote</a> from Rubin:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. I can say that is not true.</p>



<p>When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. </p>



<p>I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted. There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. </p>



<p>So no we didn’t pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-splinter-cell-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim from Nick Herman</a>, co-founder of AdHoc Studios, was that Ubisoft ‘stopped caring about’ the game the team was working on. Herman would leave around a year before Mark Rubin arrived in 2019.</p>







<p>Ubisoft is still working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell title, which is working with a reported release window of 2026.</p>



<p>Do you wish we’d gotten a new Splinter Cell game in the last ten years or so? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

			<p>Valve fans had a field day <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the announcements of the Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and Steam Controller</a>, with the notable exception of those who have been pining for Half-Life 3.</p>



<p>The near-mythological third (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly final</a>) installment in the sci-fi first-person shooter franchise was still nowhere to be mentioned by Valve, but that doesn't mean it's not coming. In fact, several insiders have doubled down to reiterate that a dedicated game announcement is on its way in relatively short order.</p>



<p>What they do not quite agree on is the timing of the news. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Gabe Follower</a>, a Counter-Strike 2 content creator who correctly leaked information on Deadlock (the studio's next third-person multiplayer shooter/MOBA game in early development), Half-Life 3, codenamed HLX, will still be announced before the end of the year. Another Valve insider, Tyler McVicker, who leaked some Half-Life: Alyx details, maintained <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2618496266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Twitch stream</a> that he expects the news to drop within the next two to three weeks.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?si=51br6QSKysH8bA3f&amp;t=2122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>, though, the resident insiders shared a different opinion based on their own sources. Mike Straw, who previously mentioned the hardware announcements weren't all Valve had to unveil, said this particular news will not be made official during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025 event next month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming founder and renowned leaker Tom Henderson added that he heard there's a big (currently unannounced) game coming in March. With the Steam Machine/Frame/Controller scheduled to launch in early 2026, it makes sense that Half-Life 3 would be a launch title, especially for the new Steam Machine.</p>



<p>After all, Valve publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it believes having more games will be key to the success of the Steam Machine compared to its previous iteration. While they were mainly referring to the massive Steam library, new launches of gaming platforms have benefited from having the so-called killer application since time immemorial in this industry. If Half-Life 3 were only available on Steam platforms, it'd mean the only console-like platform able to play it would be the Steam Machine, thus undoubtedly boosting its initial sales.</p>

<p>Use these Warframe monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Weapons, Decorations, Glyphs, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warframe is a popular third-person online shooter set in a different solar system known as the Origin system. Having originally been released on both PC as well as console in 2013, Warframe has since captured the imaginations of thousands of gamers, with a dedicated player community existing even today. It received ports for the latest generation of consoles in the last few years, and even got an iOS version in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a fully free-to-play game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warframes-switch-2-port-delayed-by-backlog-of-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> boasts solid accessibility, with the fast-paced gameplay and combat experience also being praised by passionate fans over the years. Although Warframe, like most F2P games nowadays, does offer microtransactions, all of the key elements of the game can be earned by simply playing and progressing through the various modes and events. Some cosmetic items can even be claimed for free by players, using the various redeem codes that the developers release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lawsuit between Bungie and writer Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case, which revolved around possible copyright violations of Destiny 2 from Martineau’s work, has been going on for around a year.</p>







<p>Destiny 2 is one of Bungie’s biggest and most recent games, released in 2017. With several expansions, the free-to-play title is still going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat strong</a>. However, last year, a writer named Matthew Martineau <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-being-sued-for-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie for possible copyright infringement. His claim was that the company stole various narrative elements from his work for the Red Legion plot and The Curse of Osiris expansion. Surprisingly, the case survived Bungie’s dismissal and was on its way to court. Now, it seems it has been settled and over with.</p>

<p>Obtained by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the lawsuit between Bungie and Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case has been dismissed and will not go to court. In a statement from the court filing, it says,</p>



<p>“The court having been advised that all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise in this matter; it is ordered that this action be and is hereby dismissed as to all parties, without costs and without prejudice to the right, upon good cause shown, within sixty days, to reopen the action if the settlement is not consummated,” the order reads. “In addition, the court specifically retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement if settlement is not consummated within sixty days.”</p>



<p>However, if the settlement is not completed in 60 days, the case will go to trial. As it stands, though, a compromise has been made, and no legal action will occur. Without speculation, a settlement usually means both parties are at fault.</p>



<p>While the claims made by Matthew Martineau do seem a bit much, Bungie isn’t a stranger to copyright infringements. During the alpha of Marathon, the company was caught <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealing assets</a> from artist ANTIREAL for several designs. After the controversy, the game was delayed and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to be released</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review-in-progress.1354465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review"><em>campaign review</em></a><em> or our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review"><em>multiplayer review</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite playing a new one every year, I never know what to make of modern Call of Duty – a first-person shooter so big, so successful that it is no longer a standalone game but a platform with file sizes so large it asks you to choose the other two things you’d like to have installed on your PC or console. This year’s PC release comes with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot_on_PC_for_BO7"><u>frustrating new anti-cheat</u></a> that seemingly caused my CPU fan to choose death instead, so while I would normally base my playtime on that version, as God intended, I am initially slumming it on PlayStation 5 to bring you some early impressions of this year’s Zombies mode. I still have tons left to see as the community collectively hunts for Easter eggs and solves mysteries, but so far I’m interested in digging into what’s here, even if it may take a bit to get to the vital organs underneath these bones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies is my favorite part of Call of Duty, simultaneously the stupidest, silliest side thing the series has ever done and probably big enough to be a small video game in its own right. I remarked on a similar feeling in last year's review, but remember when this was a serious game series about war, and you were storming the beaches of Normandy, machine gun fire spraying sand in your face? When you died, you used to get quotes about how terrible war was from men who had lived it. Now, I play roulette on a big mystery box covered with skulls for weapons, the best of which is a ray gun, so I can shoot zombies in the face while a disembodied voice who calls himself the Warden taunts me from afar; my character quips about how said voice reminds him of his high school gym teacher. Zombies has been doing this for a while now, but I still don’t know whether to laugh or weep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is allegedly a story here – Raul Menendez, who apparently has been alive and drinking beer on his porch for the last decade, is back and threatening to cause chaos the world over, there’s a shady security company somehow involved, and massive, violent zombie death, of course. All of it is very well-produced and so goofy that the only thing I could do was watch the introductory cutscene while emulating the face that I imagine a cow would make if you gave it cocaine, chuckle a little, and get on with it. I suppose I answered my own question there, huh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s Zombies is hard to get a handle on so far because so much of what Zombies does will come down to the community working out the new maps in the coming days and perhaps weeks. Right now, we’re all kind of bumbling about, figuring out what’s what, which is simultaneously fun and frustrating. Many of the pain points from last year remain early on – for instance, you can’t make your loadout until you hit level four, which means if Zombies is all you want to do (and for me, it is), you’re stuck with a pistol and whatever you can earn by buying stuff on the walls after you’ve dispatched enough undead. Remember when games just let you have fun from the outset instead of unlocking it?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing a shotgun until they’re paste.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, the underpinnings of Zombies feel much the same. You’re on a map, you open up new doors and paths with currency you earn, and you’ve got Pack-a-Punch machines to upgrade your guns. There’s additional armor you can apply plastered to the walls, an Arsenal to really crank up specific aspects of your weapons, Gobblegums for a little flavor if your mouth is lonely and you want a mid-battle pick-me-up, and so on. And of course, while you’re managing all of this, the undead rise and hunger for flesh. Ghouls, man. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay here is similar to last year’s – I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing off a shotgun until they’re just paste and all that. No, what’s new are the maps. I’ve played both maps in their round-based modes, Ashes of the Damned and Vandorn Farm (the latter seems to be a part of the former, but I haven’t reached it in the standard mode yet), and so far I prefer the farm. Ashes of the Damned seems to be home to what will be the more traditional “find the secrets to finish the map” fare, while Vandorn Farm is more of a “you’re locked in here with the undead, kid, so try not to die too much” deal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our run on the former ended when one of my teammates, who didn’t communicate with the rest of us, grabbed a truck and started driving it to the next objective… before he decided it might be more fun to smash into the zombies until it exploded. The rest of us spent most of the map either trying to catch up to the truck or waiting in vain to be revived after we all died. It went about as well as you’d think. I’m interested in seeing what Ashes of the Damned has to offer with a more talkative crew; right now, if you’d told me I’d hallucinated the whole thing, I’d believe you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The farm is more old-school. Zombies hang from the rafters in the big barn, the smaller one houses the Mystery Box where each of my teammates made offerings in the fleeting hope of a Ray Gun, and there was a house with a skeleton family sitting at the dinner table and a roof in desperate need of, well, more roof. It was a much more interesting map than Ashes of the Damned, and I enjoyed navigating its twists and turns, learning where everything was, and spending the in-between time killing the misbegotten horrors that were formerly people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As is usually the case, success will largely depend on how the maps shake out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem, once again, was that we couldn’t figure out what to do yet. There was some mysterious infection growing on one of the machines that seemed to power the farm, but after we destroyed it, our objective told us to wait for it to come back. So we did, killing zombies and upping the round count. The issue is the infection never did reappear. Normally, this is a good thing. The antibiotics worked and the patient is recovering well, thank you. In this case, it meant we got to round eight, nothing happened, the four of us spent several minutes looking for any zombies we somehow missed or a way to progress, and then all three of my teammates left the game after we couldn’t figure out what came next. Hard to blame them. The farm’s cool, but I'd prefer something with some warmer colors and fewer rotting corpses, you know?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said, I’m never sure what to make of Call of Duty, and that extends to this year’s Zombies. It certainly plays well and you can see the absurd amount of money spent to develop it on-screen – but the ooey, gooey, juicy parts of the mode haven’t revealed themselves to me quite yet. As is usually the case, its success will largely depend on how the maps shake out. I’ll need a bonesaw and a ribspreader to get to the still-beating heart of this thing, but that’s fine. I can’t say I’m not interested in seeing what’s in there. I just hope I don’t get anything on me in the process.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple products have long carried a premium price tag that puts them out of reach for many shoppers, forcing budget-conscious buyers toward mid-range Windows laptops instead. The landscape shifts dramatically this Black Friday as Amazon drops<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/"> the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage to $749, slashed from its regular $999 price</a>. This 25% discount is an <strong>all-time low that arrived on Friday</strong>, November 14th, and makes Apple’s latest-generation laptop accessible at the same price point as solid mid-range Windows alternatives. Apple famously avoids Black Friday sales in its own retail stores which means you need to check authorized retailers like Amazon to catch these deals when they surface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Performance That Redefines Ultraportable Computing</h2>
<p>The M4 chip provides a significant performance jump over previous MacBook Airs due to the improved architecture of the CPU and GPU that handle demanding workloads with ease. The eight-core CPU splits into performance and efficiency cores, with the system apportioning intensive tasks to high-power cores and routing background processes to power-sipping efficient cores.</p>



<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a significant boost compared to the base configuration of 8GB that shipped with previous models, offering plenty of RAM overhead for professional applications and serious multitasking. Unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU share one pool of memory, averting the data transfer bottlenecks inherent in systems where graphics processors must copy data from system RAM into dedicated video memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes by way of a 256GB SSD, providing ample room for the operating system, essential applications, and working files; however, heavy media creators or users with considerable local storage needs may want to look into external storage options. The SSD uses Apple’s custom controllers, which have a read speed of over 2,000MB/s, making the MacBook Air launch applications instantly and transfer large files in seconds.</p>
<p>The <strong>Liquid Retina display is 13.6 inches with a resolution of 2560×1664 and a support for one billion colors</strong> for excellent color accuracy and detail that is rivaled only by displays on much more expensive professional laptops. It will automatically adjust the white balance using True Tone technology if the ambient lighting changes. This reduces eye strain during marathon work sessions since color temperature is consistently maintained independent of your surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration brings AI-powered writing assistance</strong>, content generation and automation of tasks right into macOS through on-device processing that keeps your data private. This personal intelligence system helps in drafting emails, summarizing documents, generating images, and organizing information-all without sending your data to cloud servers.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches up to 18 hours of mixed use</strong> which translates to full workdays without hunting for power outlets or carrying charging cables. This endurance comes from the efficiency of Apple Silicon combined with macOS optimization that manages background processes aggressively. The laptop delivers consistent performance whether plugged in or running on battery, unlike many Windows laptops, which throttle performance significantly when unplugged as a means of preserving battery life.</p>
<p>At $749, this MacBook Air is cheaper than many premium Windows ultrabooks.</p>

              <p>Power outages leave you sitting in the dark with dead phones and spoiling food in the fridge while camping trips often mean sacrificing modern conveniences or lugging noisy generators. Jackery’s Explorer 1000 portable power station solves both problems by <strong>delivering 1,500W of clean and quiet power</strong> that runs refrigerators, charges laptops and keeps essential devices operational wherever you need electricity. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">has slashed the price to $349 from the usual $699 for Black Friday, which marks an all-time low that undercuts even Prime Day pricing</a>. This 50% discount makes backup power accessible at a price point where you’d normally find much smaller capacity units with limited output capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power Output in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,500W of continuous AC output</strong> tackles demanding appliances that smaller power stations can’t touch: air conditioners, full-size refrigerators, electric kettles, and power tools. The <strong>3,000W surge peak</strong> covers the inrush of power at startup for appliances with motors, which generally requires two to three times the running wattage for a brief moment. That surge capacity means you can cold-start a refrigerator or air conditioner without tripping the protection circuits on the power station-a problem that frequently occurs with underpowered portable generators.</p>
<p>The battery capacity, <strong>1,070Wh</strong>, translates to approximately 1.07 kilowatt-hours of stored energy-sufficient to keep an average refrigerator running for about 12 to 15 hours, charge a laptop eight to ten times, or run LED lights for days. This capacity sits in the sweet spot between smaller units that drain too quickly and larger systems that become impractical to move around. At <strong>just 23.8 pounds</strong> with a foldable handle, the power station remains genuinely portable rather than being a stationary unit that requires two people to relocate.</p>



<p>Jackery fitted this model with LiFePO4 battery chemistry instead of the more conventional lithium-ion, which grants it much better longevity and safety characteristics. The LiFePO4 cells retain more than 70% of their original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, which equates to well over a decade of regular use before you’d notice significant capacity degradation.</p>



<p><strong>The capability for one-hour fast charging</strong> requires the emergency charging mode, which can be turned on via the Jackery app and will push this power station from empty to full in sixty minutes when you need a quick turnaround. The default for the system is a 1.7-hour charging mode that optimizes battery health by reducing stress on the cells during charging, adding to the long lifespan.</p>
<p>Port selection largely covers most device types: <strong>two USB-C ports providing 100W each, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC outlets</strong>. The 100W USB-C ports can charge modern laptops at full speed with no need for bulky power adapters, while pure sine wave AC output safely powers sensitive electronics like medical devices or audio equipment that can be damaged by modified sine wave inverters found in cheaper units.</p>
<p>For sale at $349, this power station is half its regular price and brings with it capabilities that easily command between $600 to $800 in today’s market.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This HP Laptop with Serious Specs (Ryzen 7, 1TB SSD, 32GB) Is Down $2,200, Now 73% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-2200-off-but-hp-is-keeping-it-quiet-on-amazon-2000644474</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-down-2-200-now-73-off-on-amazon.1354396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops usually force you to compromise on something important whether that’s skimping on RAM, settling for slow storage or accepting some dim screen that strains your eyes. <strong>HP’s 2025 laptop breaks that pattern by packing 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U</strong> processor into a package that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/">currently offers for $799, slashed from the typical $2,999 price</a>. This 73% discount is an all-time low and brings professional-grade specifications to a price point where you’d normally find an entry-level machine with half the memory and storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Workloads</h2>
<p>The base frequency of the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U is 2 GHz with <strong>up to 4.5 GHz turbo, 8 cores, and 16 threads for powerful computing</strong> that will make short work of even the most demanding applications. This multi-core architecture is great for running parallel workloads such as video encoding, 3D rendering, or virtual machines. With 16 threads, the processor can support twice as many simultaneous operations as it has physical cores, meaning smoother multitasking when you’re working with dozens of open browser tabs along with office and productivity programs in addition to background applications.</p>



<p>The 32GB of high-speed RAM includes generous headroom for memory-intensive workflows that would choke on the 8GB or 16GB found in most budget laptops. Professional software like Adobe Creative Suite, statistical analysis tools, or development environments utilizing multiple running containers all benefit from this expanded memory capacity. You can keep numerous applications active simultaneously without experiencing the slowdowns that occur when systems run out of physical RAM and resort to slower disk-based virtual memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes via a 1TB PCIe SSD which affords rapid boot times and near-instant application launches compared to traditional hard drives or even older SATA SSDs. PCIe solid-state drives connect directly to the motherboard through high-speed lanes that enable transfer rates often exceeding 3,000MB/s, meaning large file operations complete quickly rather than devolve into progress bar watching sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>display is a 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen that operates at 1920×1080 with IPS technology</strong> so colors are accurate and viewing angles are wide. The micro-edge design minimizes the bezels around the screen to create a more immersive viewing experience and makes it feel larger than its actual diagonal measurement. Touch functionality adds another input method that feels natural for certain tasks like scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, or interacting with the touch-optimized interface elements under Windows 11.</p>
<p>For $799, this laptop is priced lower than many mid-range options, yet has specs typical of laptops costing between $1,500 and $2,000. The 73% discount places it in the unusual position of actually getting you legitimately premium components at budget pricing, not the other way around, where you pay premium prices for budget hardware.</p>

Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Steam page also includes the following disclaimer: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets." Not exactly descriptive!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Call of Duty has come under fire for this, either. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">exact scenario played out back in February</a>, when Activision admitted that it had used generative AI in the development of Black Ops 6, including in a zombie Santa loading screen that angry fans referred to as "AI slop."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline">just this past August</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie clarified the team's stance on the technology further:</p><blockquote>“We live in a world now, where there are AI tools. I think our official statement we said last year, around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent. We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes in-game.</blockquote><blockquote>"And then you're going to say, ‘Yeah, but it has.' I'll say it has by accident. And that was never the intention. We've come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game.</blockquote><blockquote>“So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it's how do we streamline it? That's really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, IGN asked why the zombie Santa and other generative AI images hadn't been removed from the game yet, to which Leslie said that was not his department, and that "the team is actively looking at that stuff." It is unclear if, why, or how Activision's stance on this has changed over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is out now. We've given the campaign a try and aren't totally crazy about it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">with our reviewer saying</a> it's " a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition, but the big swings it takes don't always land, leaving it an uneven step down from last year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

In a brief shot, we saw Mario and Luigi riding motorcycles across the desert in the outfits they're wearing above, before shooting off a sand dune and revealing the same Inverted Pyramid in a valley below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time, that just seemed like one piece of a larger montage of areas the brothers might visit during their adventures across the galaxy.

Perhaps Cappy?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, both The Super Mario Bros. Movie and what we know of this new sequel do play fast and loose with what Mario games they borrow from. The Super Mario Bros.

It includes a new map called Stella Montis, which was locked behind a community event that had to be finished first. However, Arc Raiders players didn't waste any time and unlocked Stella Montis in under 38 hours.</p><p>To reach Stella Montis--a map located in the "cold pristine" part of the Rust Belt, players had to donate a sizable amount of resources to tunnel through to that location. On <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord</a>, Embark noted that it raised the requirements to enter Stella Montis because players were being more generous with resources than the studio anticipated. Despite that, players still powered through the goal.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders - Stella Montis | New Map Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Now that Stella Montis is open for exploration, players can visit the map and start earning XP there. The map's description calls the ruins in the map "eerily pristine," as well as "cold, sterile, and steeped in mystery." There are ARC enemies to battle there, and two new types have joined the game: The Matriarch and the Shredder.</p><p>In addition to the Stella Montis quests, players can get a new energy burst battle rifle, as well as a trio of quick-use items: an impulse mine, a timed mine, and a gas jump mine. The game is also introducing two new playstyles, Lone Wolf and Trailblazer.</p><p>Last weekend, Arc Raiders set a new benchmark for itself with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">462,488 concurrent players on Steam</a>. That's a record for an extraction shooter. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-reportedly-hits-a-major-sales-milestone-as-player-numbers-stay-strong/1100-6536011/" data-ref-id="1100-6536011">sold 2.5 million copies</a> in its first week alone. However, the game has come under fire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">for using AI voice actors</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">At least Dispatch is really good!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft was, at one point not too long ago, working on a brand new Splinter Cell game. But it morphed over time to become XDefiant, according to a new report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg story about AdHoc Studio</a>, the developers of workplace superhero comedy game Dispatch, which describes their journey from Telltale Games to Ubisoft to their own independent studio. The leadership of AdHoc began working together at Telltale Games, working on Tales from the Borderlands, before Nick Herma, Dennis Lenart, and Pierre Shorette departed for Ubisoft in 2017. There, the trio worked on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told Bloomberg. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, they explain that Ubisoft was beginning to push games as a service hard across its portfolio, and Splinter Cell didn't quite fit that mould. Over time, the Splinter Cell project transformed into what would become xDefiant, a free-to-play first-person shooter that launched to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-review">middling reviews</a> last year and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">shut down just this past June, taking two entire studios with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trio eventually reunited with Michael Choung, another former colleague from Telltale, to start AdHoc Studio in 2018. While working on a version of what would eventually become Dispatch, they also took on a scriptwriting co-dev gig on The Wolf Among Us 2, only to pull out of the project after writing an 800-page script due to frustrations with a lack of creative control. That project, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/telltale-games-has-allegedly-laid-off-most-of-its-workers">last we heard of it</a>, seemed similarly ill-fated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, though, the group was able to pull together the final version of Dispatch with the support of both a publisher and a number of well-known actors thanks to casting director Linda Lamontagne. A last-minute deal with Critical Role for another game helped get them across the finish line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Splinter Cell, fans remain bereft of a new game, with the last new Splinter Cell title being Blacklist from way, way back in 2013. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-very-early-look-at-splinter-cell-remake">allegedly a remake of the original 2002 game in the works</a>, but Ubisoft has been so quiet about it since 2022 that it's hard to say whether or not it will ever fully emerge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch, meanwhile, is excellent. We're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review">working on a review in progress</a> as each episode comes out, but you can read our thoughts on the first two episodes here for now, where our reviewer says they're "totally enthralled in this world, and I’m keen to get tangled up in Robert’s fractured personal life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
