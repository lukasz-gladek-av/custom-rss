            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/neopets-tabletop-rpg-announced-by-geekify<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For Millennials, the <em>Neopets</em> franchise is one drenched in nostalgia. The novelty virtual pet game let players adopt, customize, and interact with the titular creatures in an online virtual world. In celebration of the series' 25th anniversary, a <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is coming to store shelves.</p>
<h2>The <em>Neopets</em> <em>Tabletop RPG</em> Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG </em>is being developed by Geekify. This is the studio behind dedicated <em>Neopets</em> merchandise, including calendars, enamel pins, and keychains.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=s3iCeaZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=_e9ZqIwW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Millennials, enjoy the nostalgia blast.</figcaption></figure><p>This tabletop adaptation has been in development for two years. The game will be a dice-driven, d20-based adventuring system. It will feature a class-less, feat-oriented skill system designed for accessibility for new players while scaling to advanced players.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be set within the series' unique setting of Neopia, showcasing the series' fun and goofy tone through game mechanics. Lastly, Geekify confirmed that several campaign modules are in development, starting with <em>The Fall of Faerieland</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets</em> craze started back in 1999. It was one of the earliest examples of a free-to-play experience. Players could earn two kinds of virtual currency, which could be spent on customizing their Neopet. One was earned in-game, and the other bought with real-world money. At its peak, the game sported more than 35 million players.</p>
<p>The series has changed hands across multiple platforms and publishers. In 2005, Neopets Inc. was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jun-21-fi-neopets21-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchased by Viacom</a> for $160 million. In 2014, Jumpstart Games purchased the property from Viacom. In 2017, Chinese company NetDragon purchased Jumpstart Games. The franchise seemingly died under this stewardship; the servers shut down June 2023.</p>
<p>Across this storied history, <em>Neopets</em> continued to grow and expand. It introduced unique characters, storylines, and more sophisticated customization options for their players. It also introduced some moments of embarrassment like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neopets-data-breach-leaks-your-childhood-account-information">data leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2023/03/22/remember-neopets-this-hong-kong-company-is-trying-to-revitalize-the-nostalgic-game-with-web3-technology/?sh=670cc60ce9ef" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NFT drama</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is part of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/03/neopets-plans-comeback-in-a-vastly-different-era-of-gaming.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a franchise revival</a>, courtesy of a management buyout by the aptly named World of Neopia.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geekifyinc/neopets-official-tabletop-roleplaying-game-ttrpg">coming to Kickstarter May 31</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157286/ppsspp-playstation-portable-psp-emulator-ios-app-store-iphone-ipad-apple<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the PlayStation Portable’s turn to get an emulator on the iOS App Store thanks to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">PPSSPP</a>, which just went live today. This emulator, from developer Henrik Rydgård, has been in development for more than a decade, and it’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">free to download</a> for the iPhone and iPad.</p><p>Rydgård <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/news/live-on-app-store/">says in a blog post</a> that the version approved this morning has some limitations versus previous builds of the app that were available through various exploits and <a href="https://suyogya.link/installing-sidestore-and-ppsspp-on-ios/">workarounds</a>. The biggest is that Apple doesn’t allow Just-in-Time recompilers that retranslate code for the OS and can lead to smoother performance. (It’s why we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137369/dolphinios-emulator-apple-app-store-jit">might never see</a> a GameCube / Wii emulator.) “Fortunately,” he writes, “iOS devices are generally fast enough” for almost all PSP games.</p><p>Besides that, Rydgård said iPad Magic Keyboard support had to be removed because “the old method was using an undocumented API” but that the feature will return. The emulator’s RetroAchievements feature is disabled, too. Rydgård didn’t explain why but says it’ll be back later “with a better login UI.” The same goes for Vulkan graphics API support, which he says will also come back, possibly with “a native Metal backend.”</p><p>I never owned Sony’s first handheld PSP, but I polled <em>Verge </em>staffers and was told <em>Valkyria Chronicles II</em>, <em>Patapon,</em> <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, </em>and <em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</em> are all excellent reasons to check out PPSSPP. <em>Lumines</em> deserves a mention, too. Most of those games were released on other consoles later, of course, but they do represent the kinds of experiences that were available on the system.</p><p>PPSSPP works on iOS 12 and up, iPadOS 12 and up, and can also be played on the Vision Pro. Though the app is free, Rydgård’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-gold-psp-emulator%2Fid6502287918">paid version</a> is coming soon for $4.99, he told <em>The Verge</em> via email. Assuming it’s like the $5 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dorg.ppsspp.ppssppgold%26hl%3Den_US%26gl%3DUS">Android version</a>, it may not be functionally different from the free app — it’s there to support Rydgård’s efforts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His placeable shield was more flexible than Reinhardt or Orisa’s, and his primary rock-throwing weapon did can do damage and disrupt in equal measure. On top of this, his ultimate ability, Gravitic Flux, which lifts enemies within its radius off the ground, slams them down, and cuts their health by half its base health, is still one of the most powerful ones in the game. For some reason, with <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-season patch</a></span>, Blizzard decided that Sigma’s ultimate needed a huge buff. Naturally, it’s now very broken.</p><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,192616" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Gravitic Flux is an area-of-effect ability signified by a dark circle on the ground that appears as its cast. There’s a darker center within this circle, and before this patch, a character had to be in the circle’s line of sight to be caught in the telekinetic slam. This is why characters like Mei or Lifeweaver were able to counter this ultimate by building an Ice Wall or Tree of Life that blocked teammates from being caught in the attack. This new patch removes that requirement, so now, if you’re in the circle at all, Sigma is giving you uppies. However, as some players have discovered, taking out the line of sight requirement means it can work through walls, even if Sigma can’t see those enemies.</p><p>Blizzard explicitly notes that this change was made because there’s a lot of counterplay against the Gravitic Flux, so perhaps this was the intention. But now all I can think about is how Sigma’s suddenly made for stealthy plays. Is your enemy team sitting on the payload in Dorado? Go into one of the buildings surrounding it and cast Gravitic Flux just on the edge of the room. You’re bound to catch at least one of them by surprise. This shit’s busted.</p><p>The full patch notes for <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s mid-season update are as follows:</p><h4 id="h23864"><a id=""></a><strong>COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES</strong></h4><p><strong>Demotion Protection Modifier</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Demotion Protection modifier has been moved from below the Rank Progress bar into the bar itself to improve visibility when a player is in a Demotion Protection state.</li><li>When Demotion Protection occurs, you will not be told when your progress is below that skill division’s range. If you lose your Demotion match, the Skill Rank adjustment will show only the adjustment from that match, instead of the net total of that match and the adjustment of the previous match.</li></ul><p><strong>New - Pressure Competitive Modifier</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>This rank modifier appears for players who are at the far ends of the overall skill distribution.</li><li>For players who are very high ranked (like Champion), this modifier will show when you don’t earn as much progress from winning a match or drop more progress for losing a match.</li><li>For players who are very low ranked (like low Bronze), this modifier will show when you earn more progress for winning a match or drop less progress for losing a match.</li></ul><p>Developer comments: This new modifier was added to show how our highest and lowest-skill players are being pushed toward a more average Rank. Competitive Play already calculates this Modifier to your Skill Rank adjustment, but it wasn’t visible until now. Very high or very low-ranked players will see this Modifier after every match while they continue to maintain a Rank at the outer limits of the ranked spectrum. Climbing to the highest skill tiers like Grand Masters or Champions is not intended to be easy, and overcoming Pressure to reach the top is no longer a hidden challenge that players must face.</p><p><strong>Grouping Restrictions</strong></p><p>The Skill Tier legend was updated to show the changes to grouping restrictions that were applied in a previous update. The grouping restriction changes we applied are the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Grand Master can now group within 3 divisions to be considered a narrow group.</li><li>Champion can now group within 1 division to be considered a narrow group.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: While the Season 10 changes to grouping up with friends have contributed to a large improvement in match quality for most players, we’re still looking to reduce queue times for players and groups, especially for higher ranks.</p><p><strong>MATCHMAKING UPDATES</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>When a player is currently on a loss streak, the matchmaker will try to avoid putting the player on a team that is statistically calculated to have a lower chance of winning.</li></ul><p>Developer comments: Loss streaks never feel good. Before each match, we make a prediction about which team will win the game, based on the information we have about the players on both teams. This is how modifiers such as Consolation, Reversal, Uphill Battle, and Expected give or take additional Rank Progress after each Competitive Play match. Since most matches will have a team that has a slightly higher chance of winning, placing a player on the team with the higher chance who is currently on a losing streak is aimed at helping them have a fair chance of breaking that streak. While this won’t guarantee they’ll win, it does provide a helping advantage.</p><h4 id="h23865"><a id=""></a><strong>HERO UPDATES</strong></h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Armor health has been reverted to provide a flat damage reduction of 5 per projectile, up to a maximum of 50% damage reduction.</li><li>Out-of-combat health regeneration changed from 20 health per second to 10 health per second + 5% of maximum health.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: Armor is being reverted to its original functionality to better resistance rapid fire damage and shotgun-type weapons. Out- of- combat health regeneration has been a positive but subtle addition to the game, but had a much smaller impact for tank heroes due to their massive health pools, so we’re adjusting it to heal for a percentage of maximum health.</p><h4 id="h23866"><a id=""></a><strong>TANKS</strong></h4><p>Role Passive</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Tanks now have 25% damage reduction against critical headshot damage.</li><li>Knockback resistance increased from 30% to 50%</li></ul><p>Developer Comment: Although armor health will now be more effective in some of the more difficult matchups, it will also be losing potency against the typically slower, higher damage instances. To help reduce the feeling of tanks being taken out too quickly by high bursts of damage, the role-wide passive now provides improved defense against critical headshot damage.</p><h4 id="h23867"><a id=""></a><strong>JUNKER QUEEN</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Junker Queen being able to activate Commanding Shout while swinging her axe or during her Ultimate ability will make it more responsive for when an additional burst of health or movement speed is needed.</p><p><strong>Commanding Shout</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can now be activated while using other abilities.</li><li>Cooldown reduced from 14 to 12 seconds.</li></ul><h4 id="h23868"><a id=""></a><strong>SIGMA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Similar to how Graviton Surge functions, Gravitic Flux no longer needs line of sight to affect enemy targets in its area. There are a fair amount of counterplay options to deal with this ultimate so we’re making it more reliable to grab enemy targets within its area of effect.</p><p><strong>Gravitic Flux</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>No longer requires line of sight to the center of the effect.</li></ul><h3 id="h23869"><a id=""></a>WRECKING BALL</h3><p>Developer Comment: Wrecking Ball has been performing much better after his recent update and these tuning changes will help his abilities feel more impactful.</p><p><strong>Grappling Claw</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Impact damage increased from 50 to 60.</li></ul><p><strong>Piledriver</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Movement lockout duration for enemies increased from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds.</li></ul><p><strong>Minefield</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Damage increased from 130 to 165.</li><li>Explosion knockback increased from 5 to 10.</li></ul><h4 id="h23870"><a id=""></a><strong>ZARYA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: We have been increasing the value of some tank ultimate abilities to account for the increased health pools and it helps to make the decision of when to counter-swap more of an interesting tradeoff. Graviton Surge was still very useful to set up combos with other ultimate abilities but we want to makes sure it’s powerful enough on its own.</p><p><strong>Graviton Surge</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Radius increased from 6 to 7 meters.</li><li>Duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds</li></ul><h4 id="h23871"><a id=""></a><strong>DAMAGE</strong></h4><h4 id="h23872"><a id=""></a><strong>JUNKRAT</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Junkrat’s weapon has great damage output but is unreliable outside of close range due to its slow projectile speed, which is an intended drawback to its high output. The Season 9 health changes affected Junkrat more than most other heroes since it now requires one more shot to secure an elimination. We’re increasing the damage on direct impacts to return to 2 direct hits for an elimination, without making his combo with Concussion Mine as deadly as before since that one is much easier to execute.</p><p><strong>Frag Launcher</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Impact damage increased from 40 to 45 (Total damage increased from 120 to 125).</li></ul><h4 id="h23873"><a id=""></a><strong>ECHO</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: While the main benefit of Duplicate is a second health pool and the utility of another hero’s abilities, it was often too difficult to charge an ultimate in the Duplicate time limit so we’re increasing the bonus multiplier slightly.</p><p><strong>Duplicate</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ultimate gain multiplier while transformed increased from 4 to 4.5.</li></ul><h4 id="h23874"><a id=""></a><strong>HANZO</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: The Dragonstrike ultimate hasn’t been very effective outside of being used in a combo with other abilities that restrict enemy movement, so we’re increasing its speed to help position it as less of a zoning tool and more likely to deal some damage.</p><p>Speed increased from 12 to 15 meters per second.</p><p><strong>Dragonstrike</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Speed increased from 12 to 15 meters per second.</li></ul><h4 id="h23875"><a id=""></a><strong>SUPPORT</strong></h4><h4 id="h23876"><a id=""></a><strong>BRIGITTE</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Resetting the Shield Bash cooldown on ultimate activation was too much potential burst damage for Brigitte when the average maximum health of everyone was lower, but it’s much more reasonable now that it won’t be as lethal.</p><p><strong>Rally</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Now resets Shield Bash cooldown upon activation.</li></ul><h4 id="h23877"><a id=""></a><strong>BUG FIXES</strong></h4><p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a bug with Mirrorwatch not generating stats in Game Reports.</li><li>Fixed a bug with Competitive Progress not incrementing correctly.</li></ul><p><strong>MAPS</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>General bug fixes and improvements were performed on multiple maps.</li></ul><p>Eichenwalde</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an area that could cause players to temporarily become stuck.</li></ul><p>Samoa</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a spot on the map that players could become temporarily stuck in.</li></ul><p>Shambali</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a location where players could become stuck for a period of time.</li></ul><p><strong>HEROES</strong></p><p>Mercy</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Vengeance Skin - Fixed a bug with the feathers on the skin not being properly aligned.</li></ul><p>Venture</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that counted turrets and other non-player targets as valid for the Excavation Annihilation challenge.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could occur with Burrow where Venture could remain burrowed above the ground.</li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Diablo 4's recent Loot Reborn update made a variety of changes to the game, but it seems that one tiny shift in particular might cause you a big headache if you aren't familiar with it. In short, the "Salvage All Items" function does just that: It salvages all your items, including your legendaries and uniques, so make sure you know that before you press it.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1csjgu7/psa_salvage_all_items_means_all_items_now/" rel="nofollow ">a post</a> on the Diablo subreddit, Salvage All Items used to ignore your uniques and legendaries, apparently assuming that you would want to keep these high-value items. The button will no longer make such distinctions, which at least one member of the community learned the hard way. Consider this your warning. The good news is that you can double-tap the mark-as-junk button in order to mark each of these items as your "favorites," which will make Salvage All Items avoid them again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/">Loot Reborn</a> update made the biggest changes that the game has seen yet, focusing on retooling its core mechanics and gameplay to improve the experience. For example, it totally changed the way item rolls work, with more-potent affixes across the board. It also added two new ways of upgrading a weapon: Tempering, which adds another affix from a Tempering Recipe, and Masterworking, which boosts all of the affixes to make the weapon more powerful.</p>

Players who are struggling with interstellar dogfights but finding ground combat too easy can now tweak those combat difficulty settings individually, making space combat easier and ground combat harder, or vice versa. Additionally, players who find the "Very Hard" difficulty level too easy and are hungry for a more intense combat experience can try out the new "Extreme" difficulty mode instead, which promises a high-octane challenge.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield May Update</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The May Update also includes <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/174M0cdUyxhn9mI0AvkcN9/starfield-update-1-11-36-may-15-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new performance options</a> for players who are exploring the stars via an Xbox Series X. Series X can now choose between 30fps 40fps, 60fps, or an uncapped frame rate, provided they have a Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) display running 120hz. But all is not lost for those without a VRR display--players with lower-quality displayers will still be able to select either 30fps or 60fps, and all Series X players now have access to a setting that allows them to prioritize visual performance over gameplay performance, and vice versa. A large number of bugs--especially those affecting the game's many quests--have also been addressed via the new update.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the May Update doesn't include vehicles for quicker groundside travel, Bethesda confirmed earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">ground vehicles are indeed in the works</a>, but the developer declined to share information regarding when those vehicles will become available to players. It's possible the new ground vehicles will launch around the same time as Starfield's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-coming-this-fall-ship-building-update-later-this-week/1100-6523051/">Shattered Space expansion</a>, which is set to arrive sometime this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">For a closer look at everything Starfield's massive May Update has to offer, check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2 id="PATCH_NOTES">PATCH NOTES</h2><div

Produced by Jordan Mallory.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It may only take a week to hold the annual Game Developer Conference in San Francisco every spring, but the actual work of planning, orchestrating, and marketing the convention is a year-round process. It’s a job performed by far fewer people than you might think, and is one that requires a lot of spreadsheets, even more Post-It notes, and as many hours as it takes to sort through literally hundreds of panel submissions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To shine a light on this Herculean endeavor, editor-in-chief Danielle Riendeau talks to GDC content marketing manager Beth Elderkin, as well as conference producer Sam Warnke, for a thoroughly illuminating discussion on this month’s episode of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how many people does it take to organize those hundreds of discrete events into one contiguous, coherent week’s worth of systematized programming? Far fewer than most would guess.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I have no idea how the programming team does it,” Elderkin says of Warnke’s unit. “There’s hundreds of talks, between 600 and 1,000 talks, and they curate through all of them and guide the speakers and guide the advisors through the process.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“When you're looking at each day of GDC,” she continues, “one person is in charge of organizing two of those days, and two people are in charge of organizing three of those days.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I oversee the Summits program and I am much more of a spreadsheet girly,” Warnke says. “Whereas on the Core Concept side, my colleague Kysa Korosi oversees that and she and Ashley Corrigan, also on our team, they use a physical board and move things around with magnets. I've seen pictures of this magnet board and it's a beast, and props to them because putting together the Wednesday through Friday program physically in that way—I can’t wrap my brain around it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scheduling isn’t the only hurdle that needs clearing, of course, in order for GDC to happen the way that it does. There’s also the work of liaising with the myriad publishers, developers and organizations that might want to be a part of the show, such as this year’s collaboration with the Video Game History Foundation to produce the Game History Gallery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It was so incredible to see these physical artifacts of games from the past, and also playable games that just don't technically exist anymore,” Warnke says. “It's really heartbreaking how much hard work is lost, and how many nostalgic pieces of people's lives just become unusable, or things that they can't revisit, they’re worlds that they can't revisit, and it's vitally important that we do continue this work of game preservation and continue to support foundations like the Video Game History Foundation.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland.872100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="141" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As Ubisoft looks forward to its 2025 fiscal year, the company has decided to cancel its free-to-play <em>Division</em> game, <em>The Division Heartland</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><em>Heartland </em>was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-announces-free-to-play-the-division-heartland/">announced back in 2021</a>, with Ubisoft aiming to have the game in players’ hands by 2022. The planned release window didn’t work out, but in September 2022 we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/free-to-play-division-heartland-resurgence-gameplay/">got another look at <em>Heartland</em></a>, and the game appeared to have everything you’d expect from a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. The game mixed in survival elements, pitting players against enemies swarming the fictional midwestern town of Silver Creek.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">In Ubisoft’s <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiscal earnings</a> earlier today, mixed in with all the numbers and projections, was the <em>Heartland</em> news. The company wrote, “In line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on <em>The Division Heartland</em> and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as <em>XDefiant </em>and <em>Rainbow Six</em>.”</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft’s road ahead seems to be focusing on only the biggest money makers. Last year fans were disappointed when the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel/">canceled plans for an <em>Immortal Fenyx Rising </em>sequel</a>, and of course, the company followed general industry trends by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-sees-layoffs-amid-year-full-of-them/">laying off employees</a>. According to the earnings report, Ubisoft cut 1,700 jobs over the course of just 18 months. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, Ubisoft’s back catalog seems to have been one of its most reliable streams of revenue. The report specifically calls out <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>as being a huge boon to the company, and unsurprisingly the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise also helped grease the wheels. Hopefully that will encourage Ubisoft to reexamine its decision to revoke digital licenses for old games <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fans-are-incredibly-unhappy-about-ubisoft-revoking-licenses-and-game-files-for-the-crew-following-server-shutdown/">like it did with <em>The Crew</em></a> just last month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The world wasn’t exactly dying for another free-to-play shooter, but it’s still disappointing to see a game that devs worked on for years suddenly get the ax. Maybe Ubisoft was hoping to avoid <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-skull-and-bones/">another release like <em>Skull and Bones</em></a>, while also drawing attention to its bigger upcoming releases like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>

This is great news for retro gaming fans with iPhones because it can emulate a truly eye-crossing number of retro consoles once installed.</p><p>In fact, there are too many to list here. But some notable emulation cores — the actual separately developed emulation software — included in this version of RetroArch are the NEC PC Engine, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, Virtual Boy, Neo Geo Pocket, and even the PSP (using the same core that drives the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">PPSSPP app</a> that went up today).

It has support for various features, including online gameplay, remapping buttons or keys per emulation core or per game, fast-forward and rewind, and gyro control. </p><p>You’ll need to be on iOS / iPadOS 14.2 to run the new version of RetroArch or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063353/could-emulators-be-great-in-the-vision-pro">own a Vision Pro</a>. It’s not available on the Mac version of the App Store, but that’s not a problem since there’s a macOS version (and versions for other operating systems as well) that you can <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">easily download from the RetroArch website</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We’re just a couple of days away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-comes-to-pc-in-may">Ghost of Tsushima’s PC release date</a>, as the former PlayStation exclusive prepares to drop its Director's Cut - including its expansion and multiplayer DLC - on Steam. Having recently cleared up the question around whether you’ll need to sign in with a PSN account after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">the Helldivers 2 debacle</a> - yes, if you want to play the co-op mode - developers Nixxes and Sucker Punch have now revealed that the login requirement will mean multiplayer won’t work on Steam Deck.</p>

<p>The devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-wont-need-a-psn-account-to-play-ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-devs-reassure-after-helldivers-2-fallout">confirmed last week</a> that we won’t need to create or sign in with a PlayStation Network account to play Ghost of Tsushima’s single-player campaign or the Iki Island expansion, looking to seemingly quell the risk of a backlash similar to that suffered by Arrowhead after announcing a mandatory PSN login for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> (which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">later dropped</a> - and then turned into a tongue-in-cheek cape - due to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">the sheer shitstorm of complaints</a>).</p>
<p>A sign-in will be needed for the co-op Legends mode, which was originally released as free DLC for the PlayStation 4 game, though: and therein lies the rub. While Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut will be technically supported by the Steam Deck - at least if you’re looking to play the main game in bed/on the bus/on the toilet - its developers confirmed that it’ll appear as “Unsupported” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">on Steam</a> due to multiplayer being unable to work as the result of the PSN integration.</p>
<p>“You may notice that Steam marks the game as 'Unsupported' for Steam Deck. This is due to the Legends co-op multiplayer mode requiring Windows to access PlayStation Network integrated features,” Nixxes and Sucker Punch explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/featured/?emclan=103582791474434698&amp;emgid=4188987871078331985">blog post</a> announcing the game’s pre-load going live.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine that that many people would consider a portable handheld to really be the best way to play an online multiplayer mode, but it’s still frustrating to see the restriction - especially as the much-bemoaned PSN login requirement appears to be directly to blame.</p>
<p>That’s also despite one of the arguably positive features of the PSN connection - cross-play between PlayStation and PC users - only being available in a ‘beta’ form at launch, with the devs saying it’ll be functional but won’t automatically match users on different platforms to begin with. You’ll have to invite your friends to make the most of it - which is probably the best way to play Legends regardless, but not ideal if you’re flying solo and looking to hop into a game as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that all of this follows the news that Ghost of Tsushima’s PC port <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement">won’t be sold on Steam in nearly 180 countries</a> - including Japan, <em>the very country in which the game is set</em> - due to the PSN login requirement for Legends. (Helldivers 2 was similarly pulled from sale in dozens of countries, including those where PSN accounts can’t even be created.)</p>
<p>Y’know, I’m really starting to question whether forcing a separate login for PlayStation Network on top of these games is all it’s cracked up to be.</p>

For those who likely don’t understand the significance of the move, this is the <em>very </em>first gun that players would’ve picked up and fired in the tutorial of the first <em>Destiny </em>way back in 2014.</p><p>Though the Khvostov auto-rifle you picked up just outside of Old Russia was a piece of shit that most players probably scrapped as soon as they could, this iteration of it is sure to be no joke. The Khvostov 7G-0X looks mostly the same—though it now boasts the paint job of one of its ornaments from the first <em>Destiny</em> as the base appearance—but it has a new Exotic perk that makes every seventh round fired ricochet between enemies. Seeing as how auto-rifles tend to feature magazines in the mid-20s, that’s a few guaranteed ricochets per reload, which might prove handy for clearing mobs of enemies when players undoubtedly take this weapon into endgame content.</p><p>Crucially, this isn’t the first time Bungie has re-released this weapon and made it into an Exotic.

It lacked an Exotic perk that gave it a unique ability, but what made the <em>Rise of Iron </em>Khvostov significant was that it was highly customizable; it had upwards of 100 possible perk combinations that made it highly malleable to any kind of gameplay, whether it was PvE or PvP.</p><p><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is (sorry) <em>shaping </em>up to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-story-witness-traveler-ending-1850705113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-story-witness-traveler-ending-1850705113">huge final chapter</a></span> for the franchise’s ten-year history, and what better way to do so then by honoring the past with the very first weapon players ever used. A lot of <em>The Final Shape</em> seems to be leaning into nostalgia, considering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotics-trailer-release-date-1850762166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotics-trailer-release-date-1850762166">Pale Heart setting</a></span> will apparently resemble locales that players have visited before.

I’d wager Bungie isn’t done bringing back beloved artifacts of <em>Destiny</em>’s past as it closes the book on this arc of the series, but I guess we’ll know more once <em>The Final Shape </em>launches in a few short weeks. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game will put players into the shoes of both a shinobi and a samurai in feudal Japan. While much of Assassin's Creed Shadows will sound familiar to fans--parkour, a large open world to explore, stealth assassinations, melee combat--there are some notable changes, particularly when it comes to filling out the game's map.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In the past, these have been done via synchronization points. These points are usually atop tall buildings or towers. Traditionally, synchronizing sees the camera slowly rotate in a panoramic view of the surrounding area, before marking all nearby points of interest on the in-game map.</p><p dir="ltr">That won't be the case in Assassin's Creed Shadows. There will be no spinning panoramic views in the upcoming title when synchronizing, nor will synchronizing automatically reveal nearby points of interest. Instead, players will need to survey the area and manually highlight areas of potential interest before investigating them further once back on the ground. Synchronization points will, however, still allow for players to fast travel between them.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a small, but significant change, as synchronization points, including their stylish, slow camera pan of the surrounding area, have largely worked the same for much of the franchise's long history. Other changes in Assassin's Creed Shadows include the lack of a bird that can be used to mark enemies, though players will still have access to Eagle Vision to track nearby foes. Light sources, shadows, and the weather will also play an important role in gameplay. For the first time in the franchise's history, Assassin's Creed Shadows will star a real historical figure as one of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-protagonists-launches-november-15/1100-6523473/" data-ref-id="1100-6523473">dual protagonists: the African samurai, Yasuke</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows will be similar in size to 2017's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-origins/" data-ref-id="5000-465527">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, Ubisoft has said, which means there should be plenty of Japan to explore. It will feature a non-linear campaign story revolving around tracking down and eliminating specific targets, according to Ubisoft, and it's one that will also see players building out a spy network to gather intel on targets in a system that sounds similar to one seen in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows will release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 15.

        <p>Satya Nadella mandate to increase profits prompts "unease".</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>    <div>



            <p>
A fresh report into the inner workings of Microsoft and the influence of its top boss Satya Nadella has shed new light on the pressure for Xbox to release more of its games on rival platforms in a bid to boost profits. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> states that the plan to launch more Xbox games on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, an operation dubbed "Latitude", has sparked "debate and unease" within the company at whether the move makes sense. 
</p>
<p>
Publicly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-did-we-think-of-microsofts-multiplatform-xbox-soft-launch">Xbox has suggested it is testing the waters with the four games launched so far</a> - multiplatform titles that could benefit from more players, like Sea of Thieves and Grounded, as well as smaller titles that have already reached the majority of their likely audience on Xbox, like Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment. 
</p>
<p>
But, privately, Microsoft is reportedly pushing for no "red line" at all around which games Xbox will eventually launch on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, in a bid to increase margins. </p>
<p>Eurogamer understands numerous other games are under consideration, including titles in the company's largest franchises.

</div><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's been a tough time for the wider games industry and Xbox in particular, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">falling console sales and another generation stuck way behind Sony</a>, layoffs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-last-stroll-through-redfall-at-the-pace-it-was-always-meant-to-be-played">game launches that haven't set tills ringing</a>. </p>
<p>Last year's $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard was a huge bet that helped keep Xbox in profit, but also feels like it contributed to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">cull of smaller Bethesda projects and multiple studios last week</a> in order to better balance the books - or as Xbox studios boss Matt Booty put it, ensure a "reprioritisation of titles and resources" to focus on "priority games".</p>
<p>"Put simply, Xbox bet an obscene amount of money on a future that hasn't happened," Chris Dring wrote last week, describing why Xbox believes it must cut costs now. "The market has shifted under its feet and it's having to alter direction. And some of its teams are having to pay the price." 
</p>
<p>Making games multiplatform is another move to boost profits, and should not be a surprising move following Nadella's past comment that he had "no love" for console exclusives. In the short-term, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">it has unsurprisingly found some financial success</a>. But at what cost? </p>
<p>"The philosophy of a great video game platform holder is that it makes money in order to make more consoles and more games. The philosophy of Microsoft - and by dint of that, Xbox - is evidently that it only makes consoles and games in order to make money," Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-the-point-of-xbox">wrote last week</a>. "Like so many businesses owned by gigantic, publicly-traded mega-companies, Xbox is now stuck in a cycle of thinking back-to-front. It, and I suspect much of the video game world, no longer knows why it exists."</p>

            <p>After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-is-teasing-a-classic-dungeons-dragons-monster-as-its-next-killer">teasing an upcoming chapter inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> has revealed its next killer pulled from the pages of the fantasy pen-and-paper RPG: Vecna, long-running mega-baddie and <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/series/dungeons-and-dragons/feature/who-is-vecna-dnd-stranger-things-critical-role">inspiration for the Stranger Things villain</a>. He’ll be voiced by Critical Role dungeon master Matthew Mercer and haunt a new dungeon map, where you’ll be able to do battle as new elf and bard survivors able to roll a literal d20 when they crack open treasure chests.</p>

<p>After teasing a D&amp;D crossover last week with a clip of a Beholder banging on cell bars, Dead by Daylight devs Behaviour Interactive revealed their plans for the next chapter during an <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/anniversary-recap-2024/">eighth anniversary steam</a> for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than the Beholder, it’s Vecna who’ll be the D&amp;D-inspired killer when the chapter launches on June 3rd (though you can give it a go right now in the game’s Public Test Build). The Mercer-voiced lich will have four spells - a first for DBD - to wield, including the power to fly, fire off a hail of nasty projectiles, lift up or drop wooden pallets using D&amp;D favourite Mage Hand, and negate magical items and reveal survivors in a Dispelling Sphere.</p>
<p>Those magical items can include Vecna’s own Hand and Eye, which can be found in treasure chests around the new Forgotten Ruins map alongside other magical items that help survivors to move more quietly or teleport between lockers. When those chests are opened, the game will roll the classic d20 to see what players find, granting Vecna’s powerful gear on a nat 20 - though a critical fail will cause trouble for them instead.</p>
<p>The new survivor(s) will be The Troupe, comprised of Baermar Uraz and Aestri Yazar - human and elf bard characters with the power to create illusions, cast Bardic Inspiration to speed up their allies’ generator-fixing and spot nearby generators and items with Still Sight.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>After the D&amp;D chapter releases in early June, Behaviour teased an upcoming chapter inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castlevania">Castlevania</a>. We’ll know more about that on August 6th, though a bloodsucking Dracula and a Belmont survivor of some kind - perhaps in an upside-down castle? - is a fairly safe bet.</p>
<p>Also arriving this summer will be a brand new supersized casual mode, which doubles the number of players to pit two killers against a whopping eight survivors. Instead of being hooked, caught survivors will be caged - presumably to help balance the killers’ odds - with perks disabled and replaced by a class system, I’d assume for the same reason. There will be team abilities for the killers to use, though, to help make up for a limited roster of five killers at first: the Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Huntress and Nurse.</p>
<p>More details on the 2v8 mode will be shared in July, Behaviour said, with the mode launching in an early form later in the summer.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during the stream, Behaviour gave another look at Supermassive’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassive-reveal-the-casting-of-frank-stone-a-single-player-dead-by-daylight-game">narrative spin-off The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, teased an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_DhOrH4Ds">Insider Programme for codenamed PvE game Project T</a> and revealed another DBD spin-off: a two-player co-op roguelite set inside a Jumanji-like cursed board game titled What the Fog, which is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139020/What_the_Fog/">out now and costs less than a fiver</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, in the middle of its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-year financial report</a>, Ubisoft announced that the free-to-play game Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland has been canceled. The publisher will reinvest in <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-release-date-preseason-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDefiant</a> and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six instead. Here's the full quote:</p>
<p><em>As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, which is now organized into three engagement hubs and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.</em></p>
<p>The Division Heartland was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-heartland-f2p-pc-console-game-announced-alongside-new-mobile-game-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in May 2021 alongside the mobile game (now known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-resurgence-free-to-play-mobile-alpha-sign-ups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resurgence</a>) and new content for The Division 2. Developed by Red Storm, it was set in the small Midwestern town of Silver Creek, a quiet hamlet ravaged by the so-called Dollar Flu and later occupied by various Division agents.</p>
<p>Players would have selected from a roster of playable characters and engaged in various PvE and PvP activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Massive PvEvP in Storm Operations</strong>&nbsp;- Fight together in 45-player PvEvP Storm Operations against a group of dangerous Rogue agents, an aggressive faction known as the Vultures, all while surviving a lethal virus.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Prep the Battlefield in PvE Excursion Operations</strong>&nbsp;- Complete PvE missions, gather gear, activate alerts, and prep the battlefield in Excursion Operations.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Progress and Adapt to Survive</strong> - Play as one of six agents and select between three classes each match, all with their own perks and skills.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In late 2023, the Taiwanese rating board <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-heartland-could-finally-launch-in-early-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was found to have rated the game</a>, prompting speculation that The Division Heartland would soon be launched. However, Ubisoft decided to shut down operations. The Division fans can look forward to the launch of Resurgence later this year, according to Ubisoft.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-is-finally-great.872031/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="iPs0Ms">When a live-service game undergoes a massive systems overhaul, it’s often characterized as a reversal, a change of course, even a mea culpa — particularly if the game had been headed in a direction the community didn’t like. But a truly successful update of this type is one that enables a game to be more fully itself; to unlock something beautiful that was always present at its core, just tough to get to.</p>
<p id="pmRVHQ">That’s what Blizzard did in 2014 with the “Loot 2.0” update for <em>Diablo 3</em>, which rescued a game that had been floundering since a launch beset by technical issues, an unpopular in-game auction house, and a perceived softening of the tone of this fantasy horror series. But Loot 2.0 didn’t make <em>Diablo 3</em> more like the fan favorite <em>Diablo 2</em>. It made it more like itself — flamboyant, frenetic, and surreal in its randomization — while extravagantly upping the rewards for playing, and liberating the superb combat design that had always been nestled at the game’s heart.</p>
<p id="FJi2G1">With the season 4 update for <em>Diablo 4</em> — called Loot Reborn, surely a nod to that celebrated Loot 2.0 patch — Blizzard has done it again. I wanted the patch to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23885679/diablo-3-vs-diablo-4-season-29">make the game more like <em>Diablo 3</em></a>, because I’m a <em>Diablo 3</em> fan, but it hasn’t. It’s done something better, unearthing an all-new item game within <em>Diablo 4</em> that has its own unique flavor. After just a few hours’ play, it’s clear how much more fun the game is now.</p>

<p id="6MwTbx">Season 4 has also done more than revolutionize the way loot works to make it more rewarding and less of a head-scratching nightmare of admin. It’s brought Helltides, previously a late-game activity, right into the core of the game from the start. These massively multiplayer-style live events, which draw players to areas of the map that are being assaulted by demon armies for an hour at a time, have been redesigned to make them much more intense and engaging. Now, Helltides promote an aspect of <em>Diablo 4</em> that has a distinct feel from its predecessors, with players pouring in from across the map to take on big bosses out in the open, rather than delving individually into dungeons.</p>
<p id="Dcpsb2">Unlike in previous <em>Diablo 4 </em>seasons, you don’t need to start a new character to enjoy Loot Reborn. Most of the changes and new content in this patch are permanent, and can be found on the Eternal Realm (where characters live forever and share progress) as well as the Seasonal Realm (where you need to start from scratch in most, but not quite all, things). So you can jump in with any of your previous characters.</p>
<p id="61Id0Z">That said, I actually recommend rolling a new character (seasonal or otherwise) to make the most of the patch. I had a great time leveling a new Rogue, but when I switched to a higher-level character (in the mid-40s) that I played back at the game’s launch, I could immediately tell that she wasn’t balanced correctly for the way the game works now. All her equipment was marked as “legacy” items, and she felt puny and fragile, particularly lacking the healing bonuses that are a focus of the new itemization design. It probably wouldn’t take too long to kit her out properly with post-patch loot, but it felt like it might be a bit of a slog to get there.</p>

<p id="chcXtu">The better news is that the improvements to <em>Diablo 4</em> are immediately apparent from level 1. There are new endgame systems here, like the Masterworking crafting system, which ties into a new endgame dungeon type, the Pit of Artificers. And the streamlining and liberating effects of the new loot system will probably be best appreciated by players who penetrate deep into <em>Diablo 4</em>’s meta. But they can be easily sensed almost as soon as you start playing.</p>
<p id="zuJtn3">The first thing you notice is that loot is exciting again. Slightly fewer items drop, and they have more potent affixes that are easier to understand. There are fewer arcane, situational damage bonuses, and more clearly legible boosts to your character’s power and survivability. You can more readily feel the effect of an item when you equip it, and it’s easier to understand how it fits into your character build (or doesn’t). So far, so <em>Diablo 3</em>.</p>
<p id="N2TEtV">Where Loot Reborn departs from that template is in a new crafting system, Tempering, which allows you to collect recipes for powerful affixes and then use them to enhance your loot. This replaces the old item upgrade system with a much more bespoke form of customization that’s less of a resource grind, and that gives you a creative way to tailor your equipment to your build. A potentially even bigger deal than Tempering is the revamped Codex of Power, which now collects the build-defining Aspects from Legendary weapons when you salvage them, and automatically stores only the best roll of each Aspect, which can then be applied to other items indefinitely. It’s a hugely powerful resource that’s far simpler to use, and it finally realizes the developers’ dream of a database of powerful skills that grows with the player, and constantly expands the horizons of the character builds they create.</p>

<p id="cvYLcB">So, yes, the loot is simpler and better. But Tempering and the Codex of Power, between them, define <em>Diablo 4</em> as a crafting game that gives the player an ever-growing, flexible set of tools to dial in a character build. Crucially, those tools are now easy and fun to use, fed by and feeding into a steady stream of interesting loot.</p>
<p id="7tIrZr"><em>Diablo 4</em> can still be a fussy game. Players returning after a long absence might be overwhelmed by a map crowded with icons and the seemingly infinite number of currencies, resources, and progress bars. But the developers have rightly identified their revamped Helltides as something that can cut through all this noise. The loop is simple but deeply satisfying: Slaughter demons to collect Aberrant Cinders to trade in for Tortured Gifts (i.e., good loot). The longer you keep your run going, the higher your Threat builds and the hairier things get; die, and your Threat resets, but you also lose a bunch of Cinders. The steady escalation of the stakes is really effective, as is the way these events draw players together for a common cause, giving the game a lively, MMO-esque feel.</p>
<p id="3D6DTW">I’m only a few hours and 21 levels into Loot Reborn (if anything, leveling is a little too fast at the moment), but it has absolutely reignited my desire to delve into a game that only briefly grabbed me at launch. What’s really surprised me is how much more personality <em>Diablo 4</em> has now. It feels like a game that has stepped out of the shadow of its illustrious predecessors and its makers’ live-service ambitions, and made a case for its own way of doing things. That’s a thrilling result. </p>

But unlike those games, which require you to guess and check the facts of murders and other mysterious events,<em> Chants of Sennaar</em> centers its brain games around language.</p><p>That starts with the setting and basic premise of the game. Taking inspiration from the biblical Tower of Babel, <em>Chants of Sennaar</em> takes place at the very base of a large, winding structure that has been stratified into different societies. Each has its own spoken language, written alphabet, and culture. Your job is to make it to the top of the tower, a task that requires talking to and understanding the many people you come into contact with. But at the start of the game, you can’t understand anything at all, and the game doesn’t hold your hand through the process of learning these languages. Instead, it’s about putting together context clues and thinking about the way we utilize words. </p><figure id="" data-id="ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-recommend-id="image://ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A notebook with images and symbols to decode" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A notebook with images and symbols to decode" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Focus Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-recommend-id="image://ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A notebook with images and symbols to decode" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you encounter characters in the game that speak to you in foreign tongues, an in-game notebook will fill with every letter in the alphabet.

As you continue through the world, your guess will either be confirmed by how it fits into what more characters say, or you will quickly realize you were way off base.<br></p><p>The puzzles start with something as simple as translating “open” and “close” in the game’s opening minutes when you’re blocked by a closed-off gate, and quickly progress into linguistic detective work about understanding tenses, different ways sentences can be structured, and punctuation. It’s not long before you also have to translate between multiple languages at the same time. If that sounds boring, I can’t tell you how wrong you are. At one point I realized one language would repeat a noun’s symbol to indicate it was plural while another had a specific symbol to denote a noun was plural and I felt like the smartest person in the world.</p><p><em>Chants of Sennaar</em> is a game for people whose favorite gaming accessory is a pen and notebook. It rewards critical thinking and observation of the game world. But even with its complex challenges, the game can be finished in less than ten hours.

<p>With the many recent titles launching from Ubisoft featuring an in-game store full of cosmetic and convenience items, like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Skull and Bones, most of us are curious about Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Will it feature microtransactions? Is Assassin’s Creed Shadows always online? Here’s what we know so far!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-assassin-s-creed-shadows-require-a-constant-internet-connection">Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Require a Constant Internet Connection?</h2>



<p>We can confirm that Assassin’s Creed Shadows requires a constant internet connection to play. Most of Ubisoft’s titles have always-online requirements, especially with their recent attempts to push microtransactions via in-game stores from the menu.</p>



<p>I don’t doubt Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature some form of cosmetics, especially considering how aesthetic samurai armor typically appears in video games. There’s a lot of room for cosmetic armor sets, like those seen in Ghost of Tsushima, and many players will eat that up!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-who-are-naoe-and-yasuke-the-first-assassin-s-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-all">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-are-naoe-and-yasuke-the-first-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Are Naoe and Yasuke? The First Assassin’s Creed Shadows Trailer Reveals All</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-does-assassin-s-creed-shadows-have-microtransactions">Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Have Microtransactions?</h2>



<p>We do know that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature cosmetics in the form of armor, weapons, and animal companion skins. Plus, the game features a hideout mechanic, in which you can customize your lair to suit your style within the Shinobi League.</p>



<p>If you purchase the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Ultimate Edition, you’ll receive the Ultimate Pack, which includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Sekiryu Character Pack</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gear and Weapon Sets for Naoe and Yasuke</li>



<li>Sekiryu Beast</li>



<li>Dragon Tooth Trinket</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>The Sekiryu Hideout Pack</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unique ornaments for the hideout</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Five Skill Points</strong></li>



<li><strong>Red Dragon Filter in Photo Mode</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s safe to assume that, like past Ubisoft titles, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature an in-game store, accessible from the main menu and in-game menu, with various cosmetics and convenience items available for real money purchase.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re as excited as you are for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but in the meantime, check out what else Insider Gaming is up to:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-may-2024-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sony has revealed the full line-up of PlayStation Plus Games Catalog additions for May 2024, which includes Red Dead Redemption 2, Cat Quest, Watch Dogs, and more.</p><p>Announced on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-red-dead-redemption-2-deceive-inc-crime-boss-rockay-city-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, a total of 13 games are joining the library: 10 in the Games Catalog available to Extra and Premium members and three in the Classic Games Catalog only available to Premium members.</p><p>While perhaps a thinner line-up compared to recent months, the addition of Red Dead Redemption 2 will carry May's line-up a long way. It's worth noting this is actually a return to the service for Rockstar's open-world cowboy adventure, however, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-playstation-plus-games-lineup-red-dead-redemption-2-assassins-creed-valhalla-and-more">it was one of the first games announced for the Games Catalog</a> two years prior. All games hit the service on May 21.</p><h3>PlayStation Plus Games Catalog Additions for April 2024</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/deceive-inc">Deceive Inc</a> | PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4: City Living</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/crime-boss-rockay-city">Crime Boss: Rockay City</a> | PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-settlers-new-allies">The Settlers: New Allies</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/stranded-alien-dawn">Stranded: Alien Dawn</a> | PS4 + PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/cat-quest">Cat Quest</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/cat-quest-ii-the-lupus-empire">Cat Quest 2</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-lego-movie-2-videogame">The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> | PS4</li></ul><h3>PlayStation Plus Classics Games Catalog Additions for April 2024</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/2-xtreme">2Xtreme</a> | PS4 + PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/g-police">G-Police</a> | PS4 + PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/07/worms-pinball">Worms Pinball</a> | PS4 + PS5</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar Games' take on the wild west as players take on the role of Arthur Morgan as he looks tries to survive in America's unforgiving heartland. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-review">IGN deemed it a masterpiece in our review</a>. "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era," we said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Deceive Inc. deploys you into the world of high stakes subterfuge, working for a private corporation with complete monopoly over the international espionage market. Rival spies are after the same objective as the player, however, and each one of them is as equally skilled, cunning, and well-equipped.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-sims-4/City_Living_Guide">The Sims 4: City Living</a> is an expansion for the beloved simulation game, and while the base version of Sims 4 is required to play, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-base-game-will-soon-become-totally-free">this is also permanently free</a>. City Living lets players take their Sims to the city and explore everything it has to offer, from bustling action right outside the front door to unique situations that come only with apartment living.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Crime Boss: Rockay City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Crime Boss: Rockay City is a stealth action first person shooter where players look to become the leaders of a criminal underworld in 1990s Florida. IGN didn't rate it very highly, however, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crime-boss-rockay-city-review">giving it a 4/10 in our review</a>. "Crime Boss: Rockay City's hokey charm is nowhere near strong enough to offset its bugs and repetitive design, and it totally squanders its kitsch cast," we said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The latest instalment in the long running strategy game series, The Settlers: New Allies lets players discover new worlds and build sprawling cities as they take control of a band of settlers who have fled cataclysmic events in their homeland to seek new lands to settle, explore, and conquer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>On a somewhat similar note, albeit with a sprinkle of sci-fi, Stranded: Alien Dawn is a planet survival sim placing the fate of a small marooned group in the player's hands. Promising compelling and immersive strategic gameplay, players must make vital decisions to protect their survivors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Cat Quest and its sequel, the aptly titled Cat Quest 2, will both be available through the PlayStation Plus Games Catalog. Both 2D, open world role-playing games set in a world full of cats, players must embark on a quest to save their catnapped sister in the first game while the second sees them fight to save the world of cats from advancing dog armies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>Classic LEGO goodness arrives through The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game, which lets players bash and build their way through the events of the film. Alien monster invaders have left Bricksburg in ruins and taken Emmet's friends, and it's now up to him and his team of heroic characters to go beyond their world and save their friends from the strange inhabitants of the Systar System.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Watch Dogs is the first open-world action game set in the fan-favorite franchise, kicking things off with solemn protagonist Aiden Pearce hacking (with, like, a smartphone) his way through Chicago. "Watch Dogs is an excellent open world action game with some unique hacking magic that makes it a memorable experience," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-dogs-review">IGN said in our 8/10 review</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/a-1715792649682.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>On the classic games front, 2Xtreme was promised to be a high flying sports game where players could snowboard in Japan, in-line skate in Last Vegas, mountain bike in Africa, skateboard in Los Angeles, and more. Unfortunately, however, it couldn't stick the landing, as when the PlayStation classic was re-released for the PlayStation Portable, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/13/2-xtreme-review">IGN gave it a rare 2/10 in our review</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/2-1715792674092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another PlayStation classic, and one that received a better rating from IGN, comes in G-Police. This 1997 title saw Jeff Slater join a voluntary police force after an unspeakable corporate cover-up caused his sister's death. As a helicopter pilot, players must fly through 35 grueling levels to take their revenge. "With a flair for the dramatic and an attention to detail that should impress even the toughest of critics, G-Police is a rock-solid example of great gameplay," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/17/g-police">we said in our 8/10 review.</a></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/3-1715792697534.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Finally, Worms Pinball rounds out May 2024's PlayStation Plus Classic Games Catalog additions, and does exactly what it says on the tin. This 2000 title is a mix of pinball and the wacky Worms characters, offering a table sporting 3D LED displayed sub-games and parallel objectives, transparent ramps, user-controllable moving gadgets, bounce and flip passes, bang backs, death saves, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

In it, you play as both a shinobi assassin and a samurai warrior in feudal Japan, with the ability to switch between the two characters seamlessly. Fans of the series have been requesting this historical setting for a long time, and Ubisoft is finally delivering it. And unlike last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, this is a full-priced game, starting at $69.99 -- so you can expect it to be a full-sized open-world experience. Other editions cost more, so let’s break it all down below.</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows (Standard Edition)</h2><div id="200650"><p>Out November 15</p><p><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3></p></div><p><strong>PS5</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRDPD" target="_blank">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $69.99 (free lithograph set)</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/0PYl5" target="_blank">Get it at GameStop</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/6XBv7" target="_blank">Get it at Walmart</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/1vrD5" target="_blank">Get it at PS Store (digital)</a> - $69.99</li></ul><p><strong>Xbox Series X</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPpKk" target="_blank">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $69.99 (free lithograph set)</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/AdWeo" target="_blank">Get it at GameStop</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/4AGgy" target="_blank">Get it at Walmart</a> - $69.99</li></ul><p><strong>PC</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3dXBm" target="_blank">Get it at Gamesplanet</a> - $62.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/yLK3e" target="_blank">Get it at Ubisoft Store</a> - $69.99</li></ul><p>If all you want is the core game and nothing else, you got it dude: grab the standard edition.

So, yeah. Big.</p><p>The game starts out in 1579 Japan, when all kinds of interesting things were happening in the country. Like in Assassin's Creed Syndicate, you play as two protagonists. First there's Naoe, a shinobi assassin, and then there's Yasuke, a real-life historical figure who was an African immigrant who became a samurai.</p><p>Combat-wise, Naoe is more geared toward the stealth approach, while Yasuke is better at going into encounters swinging. As the title implies, shadows play an important role in the game, with a light meter letting you know how visible or hidden you are from enemies. </p><p>And unilke Mirage, AC Shadows will not be available on previous-gen consoles, so no PS4 or Xbox One.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The company will move resources to "bigger opportunities" such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six</h2></div><section><p>Ubisoft has canceled its upcoming free-to-play shooter, Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland, amid larger plans to focus resources on "bigger opportunities."</p><p>This news was revealed as a part of Ubisoft's earnings release this morning, with the company saying it has "redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six." The move is part of a larger, longer process Ubisoft has been undergoing in recent quarters to restructure its teams, cut costs, and concentrate its resources into fewer, bigger games. </p><p>Ubisoft offered the following statement on the cancellation:</p><blockquote>After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately. Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.</blockquote><p>The Division Heartland was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-free-to-play-the-division-heartland">first announced back in 2021</a>, and was being developed by North Carolina-based Red Storm Entertainment. It was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-quietly-delayed-tom-clancys-the-division-heartland">quietly delayed</a> not long after its reveal with its planned release moving to last fiscal year, but it never materialized. Heartland did go <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-heartland-is-gearing-up-for-another-testing-phase">through multiple testing phases</a>, and was in a publicly playable state. Recently, it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-heartland-gets-a-rating-in-taiwan-hinting-a-release-date-could-be-imminent">received a rating in Taiwan</a>, leading fans to believe its release was imminent, but this seems to have been a false alarm.</p><p>Ubisoft has been on a game-cancelling spree of late, having shut down <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">three unannounced games</a> including its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-mysterious-project-q-has-been-cancelled">mysterious Project Q</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-fenyx-rising-2-reportedly-canceled-ubisoft">Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</a> just last year. The prior year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once">cancelled four other unannounced games</a>, with the company explaining its decision by saying it had been trying to make too many games at once.</p><p>And in the last year in particular, Ubisoft (like many other major gaming companies) has been undergoing major cost-cutting measures, which have included the aforementioned game cancellations, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-plans-to-close-mobile-studio-ubisoft-london-formerly-known-as-future-games-of-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio closures</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-lays-off-124-employees-to-enhance-collective-efficiency">multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. As noted in Ubisoft's earnings release, it has reduced its employee numbers by over 1,700 people over 18 months "while retention has continued to improve." As of March 2024, Ubisoft employs 19,011 employees globally.</p><p>In today's earnings call, CEO Yves Guillemot told investors the company was "back on track" for a "profitable growth trajectory," noting the company's record annual and quarterly net bookings reported today. Going forward, Guillemot continued, the company will pursue a strategy of returning to leadership in open world adventure games while expanding its games-as-a-service offerings. This year, the company expects to release Assassin's Creed Shadows (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">just fully revealed today</a>), Rainbow Six Mobile, Star Wars Outlaws, The Division Resurgence, and XDefiant.</p><p>And technologically, Ubisoft is narrowing its focus on its own internal game engines to just two branches, Anvil and Snowdrop, and is aggressively pursuing generative AI tech especially with its NEO NPC program.</p><p>For the full year, Ubisoft reported €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion) in net bookings, and €401 million ($436 million) in operating income.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<section><p>GameSpot had the opportunity to chat with Midsummer Studios co-founder and XCOM designer Jake Solomon about the studio and its upcoming Gilmore Girls inspired life sim.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Jake Solomon is no stranger to creating complex games; his credits on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xcom-enemy-unknown/" data-ref-id="5000-128363">XCOM</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-midnight-suns-tips-for-beginners/1100-6509737/" data-ref-id="1100-6509737">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>, and numerous other strategy games over his 23-year career at Firaxis prove that much. And yet, Solomon's next venture presents the veteran game designer with a challenge he's never before encountered.</p><p dir="ltr">"With this game, I don't even get hit points," Solomon laughed.</p><p dir="ltr">On May 14, Solomon announced that, alongside Firaxis teammate Will Miller and former The Sims' director Grant Rodiek, he was creating a new, independent studio: <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Midsummer Studios</a>. With less than a dozen developers and a whopping $6 million already invested into the studio by a number of different production companies (including Trevor Noah's Day Zero Productions), Midsummer offered Solomon a different approach to game development that feels "more stable." However, this doesn't mean things have been simple--and it's not <em>just </em>because the studio's upcoming game doesn't have hit points.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was pretty naive about funding when I left," Solomon said. "I left Firaxis on good terms and because this game [we're working on] feels like something that you almost need to build a studio around because it's so different. But then I left, and I think in my head, and honestly with me being an idiot, I thought I'd step out and the world would fight over funding me. And then I was like, "Oh sh*t. There's actually hardly any funding.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a really rough [time for the industry]. Very few things got funded last year and then of course all these <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">horrific layoffs and studio closures</a>. I didn't [leave Firaxis] as a result of it, but I think I definitely felt it."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, Solomon and his team had an idea that was ultimately a large part of why the studio got funded, according to the game director: creating an "emergent-story life sim." Billed as a competitor to Maxis' The Sims, the studio's currently untitled debut game is a life sim that focuses slightly less on cosmetic design in favor of deep storytelling. Solomon said he brought up The Sims series' lack of competitors to investors, as it feels like an oversight in the gaming industry that leaves a large demographic of gamers "underserved."</p><p dir="ltr">"I think part of the reason we got funded was our ability to say, 'Hey look, in the industry, if there was a game that was 25 years old, and was still this successful--I mean, they just announced in their earnings report yesterday that there are over 85 million players--but if it was <em>this</em> successful and their audience is <em>this</em> loyal, any other game in our industry would have a hundred competitors."</p><p dir="ltr">Solomon admits it might be weird to fans of his work to see him take up this cause, as he is primarily known as "the XCOM guy." However, this pivot actually makes a lot of sense. On top of being a longtime fan of life sims and learning under Sid Meier, a pioneer of the simulation genre, Solomon has been dabbling with life-sim elements for some time.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the surface, I'm sure it will seem like a weird jump to some people… I totally understand if people are like, 'Oh the XCOM guy?'" Solomon laughed. "Yet even on the last XCOM I designed, there was something called Soldier Bonds, where your soldiers formed relationships. And that was just dipping my pinky toe in it.</p><blockquote><p>"Then with Midnight Suns, I probably lavished way too much attention on my--let's face it--Marvel dating simulator. Which I always wanted to make, so I think that was a manifestation of mine.</p></blockquote><p>"But I've always thought that if you make system-based games, which I do, you can apply systems to almost everything… And this may be trite, but I have thought that conversation is basically turn-based combat."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>An emergent-story life sim</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Midsummer Studios' debut game is more of a "choose-your-own adventure" life sim than a traditional sandbox title, Solomon told me--though he was also quick to assure me that the game will feature a creative mode that emulates a more-traditional life sim, and allows players to exert more control over their town and its inhabitants. But as for its base game, Solomon said that rather than players creating several multi-character families, they will instead focus on creating a single character and living out their day-to-day life as them while a branching narrative takes them on a journey they help write.</p><p dir="ltr">"So Grant [Rodiek] is our executive producer and he was a director on The Sims for a long time. And he told me that most players play with a single Sim," Solomon explained. "So we have a main character that you are starting the story of.</p><p dir="ltr">"Then we do two things: We choose what storylines make sense and will be interesting to inject in your character's life, and then we also generate characters to cast around your main character and pre-seed them with relationships that make the story interesting. In that way, we're very different from something like The Sims. So if you were like, 'Hey, I'm trying to tell a story where I find my soulmate,' we would be like, 'Okay, well then here's your ex-lover and also they're your co-worker. Here's your high school boyfriend who is your neighbor, and here is your secret crush who is also your business rival.' ...And of course, you can edit those when we generate them. You can say, 'No, I don't want that or no, they don't look like that,' and edit whatever you want. But we want the player to step into a very story-rich environment even when they start the game."</p><p dir="ltr">From there, the game will ask players "leading questions" that allow players to author the story they want to tell, according to Solomon. One example he gave was a scenario in which a neighbor mentions to the player character that they saw their father in town. The player can then respond to this in a variety of ways, including telling the neighbor "I never want to see him again" or "Yeah, we're having a hard time getting over the loss of my mom so I'm trying to spend quality time with him." This then informs the game of what the player wants their relationship to look like, and kicks off a particular chain of events.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Shedding internal values</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Yet a challenge with this style of gameplay, Solomon told me, is emboldening players to take control of the story and make choices that are interesting rather than safe. However, enticing players to shed their "internal values" is not always an easy task. In choice-driven RPGs, for example, acting in more outlandish ways can, at best, make some players feel like they are deviating from the intended story. In the worst-case scenario, players can even feel punished by making these choices--such is the case with games like Fable, which alter your appearance based on your character's morality. The team is attempting to remedy this by incentivizing "high-conflict" actions with bigger rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">"For a story to be interesting, there has to be some element of surprise to it and it's tough when you're the author and also we need to surprise you. Since we can't inject surprises into your story, we also want the player to surprise themselves," Solomon said. "We're going to tell players, 'Hey, if you did something humorous in this situation, you're going to get a bigger reward right now. If you do something romantic, bigger reward. If you do something confrontational, bigger reward.' And it makes you as a player kind of stop and think like, 'Well, okay, fine. I will actually choose an option that's a little more humorous because the game is telling me in this case, I can be rewarded.'</p><p dir="ltr">"And this <em>is</em> a life sim, so you can do whatever you want, but we're kind of trying to entice the player to make small choices that are different than they would normally do [so] that they come back to the player in surprising ways. That way, every time you play, you get the player steered off in a direction that surprises themselves. The player is the first person that needs to be entertained by their story, so getting players to surprise themselves is something that I've really thought about in our design."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A town can be a character</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Another key component of Midsummer Studios' game design is the game's town. Solomon explained that he wants players to think of it as its own character, similar to Gilmore Girls' Stars Hollow.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"What I talk about more than anything else is Stars Hollow and Gilmore Girls. Stars Hollow is one of those places with such a strong sense of place--you want to go there," Solomon said.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">He added that the team also looked to Virgin River, Stephen King novels, and even British murder mysteries for inspiration--any location that is filled with characters who know one another and form strong relationships, even if they are hidden.</p><p dir="ltr">Discovering these hidden relationships and getting to know your neighbors is another feature that adds depth to the upcoming game. Solomon said that, while The Sims has meaningful moments, part of Midsummer Studios' goal was to elevate smaller situations that would have deep consequences in reality.</p><p dir="ltr">"With The Sims, you have all these moments: you have children, you get married, all those things. But then you also have [smaller scenarios] where you go to a party and you're like, 'My wife and our old neighbor are chatting so why am I seeing hearts go up? What the f*ck are you two doing?'" Solomon laughed. "We want the game to recognize that it's this elephant [in the room]."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A new wave of life sims</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">It was at this point I decided to address the elephant in <em>our</em> room. Though there has been a distinct lack of The Sims competitors in the past few decades, an influx of Sims-likes are on the horizon. Life By Solomon laughed and admitted he thought it was wild how so many studios seemingly had the same idea at once, but ultimately said he thinks it's a great thing for the genre.</p><p dir="ltr">"I genuinely believe that it's a good thing for there to be so many life sims. I mean, one of the special things about The Sims is it's so massive that it has multiple audiences. There are the people who do house building. There are people who go on Tumblr and post the screenshots of their characters and these stories that are so involved. They actually project a lot of story onto their characters, and those are probably the players that we're targeting. And then there's the Wicked Whims crowd… if you know, you know," Solomon joked. "But there's multiple audiences. And because they don't act like a normal core game audience, they're really underserved. It doesn't make any sense.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think more life sims will simply ignite interest in The Sims players who have been essentially resigned to the fact that there is only one way to fulfill this specific fantasy. The Sims players will see there are actually alternatives, and so I think it will help the community be rejuvenated. I can't see it as anything other than a net positive, and it helps us that the other life sims all have their own take on a life. We want to focus on the story you're telling. Injecting drama into a character's life that you have authorship over. We want you to feel like you are living inside of a story."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Release date</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Midsummer Studios does not yet have a title or release date for its upcoming life sim. That said, Solomon confirmed the studio is "prototyping right now" with the goal of releasing a demo next year. He added that the studio is "very fortunate" to be in a position where its employees don't feel pressured to think about a release date right now.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're funded and venture-capital-backed, which is new for me. And the nice thing about that is that you have the money up front, so we're able to over-communicate with our team and just say, 'This is the exact amount of money we have in the bank. This is our hiring plan, which means that we're all just fine until this date, so let's just focus on what we're working on.' And luckily our team can feel safe, which is not a given in this industry lately."</p>

                <p>The Nier team isn't shy about good-naturedly taunting or riling up their fans, and that's exactly what series producer Yosuke Saito did in a recent talk. Speaking with former Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi in Weekly Famitsu, Saito strongly implied that he's working on a new project with Nier series creator/director Yoko Taro and series composer Keiichi Okabe. However, he can't say much about it for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">As translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe">Gematsu</a>, Saito said the following: "I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be Nier, it might not be Nier. That's about all I can say for now."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nier (Original) vs Nier Replicant Ver.1.2247 Graphics Comparison</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Yoko Taro's playful public persona can result in some confusion about the future of the series. For example, in a <a href="https://twitter.com/NieRGame/status/1473654809261711360" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holiday 2021</a> message, Yoko joked that the Nier series will get no new entries, unless he gets a pile of money, of course. The last entry in the series, Nier Replicant, which reimagined the original Nier, came out in 2021. Yoko recently garnered headlines when he said that the recent PS5 game Stellar Blade is better than his famed Nier Automata in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim" rel="nofollow ">an interview</a>, citing its next-gen graphics and character design as particular highlights.</p>

The company also reported a slight increase in "unique active users" from last year across console and PC. That number rose four percent to a total of 138 million unique active users.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That success is rather impressive given that Ubisoft's release slate for the last year has been a little thinner than usual. In late 2023, the company released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Mirage </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

Said games fit neatly into Ubisoft's plans to strategically focus on open world adventure and games-as-a-service (GaaS) titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there's a frustrating catch to Ubisoft's success: the path to hitting those numbers was paved in part by laying off almost 2,000 employees across its global studios.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ubisoft reduced €150 million in costs in 2024">Ubisoft reduced €150 million in costs in 2024</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft stated in its report that it laid off 1,700 workers in the last two years, helping it achieve €150 million in annual cost reductions. It's targeting €200 million in cost reductions by 2026.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's currently unknown if that €50 gap will be filled by laying off more workers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a bitter twist, Ubisoft couched its layoff stats by stating that employee retention "continued to improve" over the same period it was laying people off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That retention may be driven by improved morale and affinity for the company.

<p data-characters="299" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Competitive <em>CoD </em>doesn’t just encompass the <em>Call of Duty</em> League in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>. <em>Warzone</em> also has a rich esports scene, featuring online tournaments that several players have turned into full-time careers thanks to substantial cash prizes, sponsorship deals, and organization partnerships. </p> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Most money in <em>Warzone</em> to be earned comes from the World Series of Warzone, which had a $500,000 prize pool for the Global Final and a $600,000 prize pool spread across two NA and EU Regional Finals in 2023. In addition, other sponsors host Activision-sanctioned online tournaments throughout the year with massive prize pools that net top pros with winnings that rival major events in the <em>Call of Duty</em> League.</p>
 <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="188" data-injectable="false">Every year, a new crop of talent emerges and takes over the battle royale, but a few grizzled veterans consistently place well, shown by their overall career earnings <a href="https://warzoneearnings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per Warzone Earnings</a>.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Top 10 highest-earning Warzone players</h2> <h3 id="h-10-jukeyz" data-injectable="false">10. Jukeyz</h3> <figure data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Former London Thieves content creator Jukeyz transitioned to competing full-time in Warzone. The decision paid dividends, as the EU-based player has established himself as a top performer. In 2023, Jukeyz won the World Series of Warzone Stage 2 Final and placed second in the Stage 1 Final. So far in 2024, Jukeyz already has two tournament wins and a handful of impressive finishes to help see him into the top 10 all-time earners. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">9. SuperEvan</h3> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">SuperEvan hasn’t quite found success on the biggest stage in the World Series of Warzone just yet, but he consistently places high in online tournaments and has built up an impressive career in the battle royale. Alongside a new trio of HusKerrs and Braalik, the talented new squad has all of the makings to add more winnings to that total. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">8. Rated</h3> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">Rated started his career as a professional <em>CoD</em> player, most notably placing second at the 2016 Call of Duty World League Championship. But the Welsh pro transitioned to <em>Warzone </em>in 2020 after a long career and did so seamlessly. In 2023, Rated won the NA Stage 1 Final and finished second in the Stage 2 Final. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">7. HusKerrs</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">Starting his career in 2020, HusKerrs became the first player to earn $100,000 and has since only added to that total. A third-place finish in the 2023 WSOW NA Stage 1 Final and other high finishes across the past two years have kept the long-time pro near the top of this list. </p>

Newbz</h3> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">The trio of Tommey, Almond, and Newbz was a premier team last year, winning nearly $1.3 million in prize money combined. However, the accomplished squad parted ways and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/some-of-warzones-most-dominant-players-may-have-found-their-third-in-another-champion/">replaced Tommey with Hisoka</a>. So far, that move has worked out just fine, as the new squad won the $30,000 Oh Mama tournament in their first official event. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">5.

 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Since winning the 2023 WSOS Global Final, Biffle has only gone and added to a career earnings total that seems to increase with every tournament.

 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Fifakill usually ranks as one of the most-watched <em>Warzone</em> streamers on Twitch, and that doesn’t even account for his career earnings from official tournaments. In a trio with other well known EU talents Jukeyz and Lenun, Fifakill regularly places high in tournaments and might even rank higher on this list by the end of the year. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">3.

 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">Almxnd is no stranger to winning when the lights are bright and the decorated <em>Warzone </em>player has plenty of first place finishes to prove that.

 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Tommey still ranks first in all-time tournament winnings, and that gap shows no signs of closing. Tommey transitioned seamlessly from being a professional&nbsp;<em>CoD&nbsp;</em>player to the battle royale scene and hasn’t looked back since.</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="false">Tommey, Newbz, and Almond displayed their talent throughout the 2023 WSOW event. The talented trio placed second at the Stage One NA Finals and bounced back to win the Stage Two NA Finals. Recently Tommey teamed up with the reigning 2023 WSOW champions Biffle and Shifty, meaning that total could easily increase soon.</p>

<p data-characters="402" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Blizzard has revealed the upcoming Season 6 of <em>Warcraft Rumble</em> as its biggest yet with the addition of Sieges and Raids. The first Siege, Stormwind, will launch on May 29 followed by the first raid, Molten Core, just a week later on June 5. The company also announced that Season 7 a month later on July 10 will feature the first-ever new Family, Cenarion, adding two new leaders and three more troops.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="MAJOR CONTENT UPDATE | Warcraft Rumble" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6hAbTZnzKA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-siege-of-stormwind-and-molten-core-raid" data-injectable="false">Siege of Stormwind and Molten Core Raid</h2> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">The first Siege in <em>Warcraft Rumble</em>, Stormwind, will offer bite-size three-mission co-op adventures for players and their guildmates to lay siege to the Human city of Stormwind. Successful sieges will earn all participants some mighty rewards for their efforts.</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Raids on the other hand, the first of which will be Molten Core, will serve as the tower defense/RTS hybrid most challenging content yet. Designed as a co-op gauntlet, Molten Core will require two players to strategize and execute that strategy to take out Ragnaros and his minions to earn powerful rewards including the ultimate prize: Ragnaros himself as a playable Leader.</p> <h2 id="h-season-7-to-add-new-cenarion-family" data-injectable="false">Season 7 to add new Cenarion Family</h2> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">Just over a month after Season 6 begins, Season 7 will follow suit. This season will include the biggest expansion of <em>Warcraft Rumble’s</em> Mini roster to date, adding the Cenarion Family. Cenarion will include two new leaders and three more troops allowing players to build and wreak havoc with druidic-centric armies.</p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">Blizzard plans to share more about the new Cenarion family as well as details on Season 7 later this Summer.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">I wonder what Cenarion Circle members we’ll get as the two new leaders. Obviously answers include Cenarius and Malfurion Stormrage, though we may see more notable yet not mainline Cenarion figures such as Remulos from Moonglade or Naralex from inside the Wailing Caverns.</p> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="false"><em>Warcraft Rumble</em> Season 6 kicks off on May 29 on mobile devices, which is also when we will get the Stormwind Siege.</p>

<li>Sign in with your Microsoft account.</li>
<li>Select a mouse and keyboard-supported game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later in May, users will also be able to use the Xbox app on PC by selecting a game with a mouse and keyboard badge. From there, they can use their mouse and keyboard to control the game, just like on any PC game. It is even possible to switch between using a mouse and keyboard combination and a controller at any time by simply pressing a key on the keyboard or the Xbox button on the controller.</p>
<p>The Xbox app on PC also received an update. To start with, there's a new channel dedicated to the upcoming game Senua's Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory. Moreover, Microsoft began rolling out some new Compact Mode features, including Jump back in and Friends, with a subset of players and with all Xbox Insiders.</p>

  <p id="fo6HWB"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126226/x-men-97-genosha-e-extinction-morlocks-cassandra-nova"><em>X-Men ’97</em></a> closed out its first season in the glorious, traditional way of its forebear, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24106782/x-men-animated-series-97-92-censors-broadcast-standards-practices"><em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em></a>. That is to say, with a wild cliffhanger. </p>
<p id="lxEKme">But unlike the last season of <em>The Animated Series</em>, which saw Professor Xavier leaving Earth to (presumably) die of wounds sustained in battle with anti-mutant forces, <em>X-Men ’97</em> won’t take 27 years to follow up. </p>
<h2 id="ToBzcR"><strong>Is X-Men ’97 getting a second season? </strong></h2>
<p id="SFRizA">Yes! <em>X-Men ’97</em>’s second season was greenlit in back in 2022, and production on it is already largely wrapped, with Marvel Animation spinning up production on a third season as well. </p>
<p id="vCWkdI">It’s a good time to be a fan of the X-Men in animation! </p>

<p id="fOHkYD">In a word: Apocalypse. The final episode of season 1 left the X-Men separated across three different time periods following the destruction of Magneto’s floating base, Asteroid M. This doesn’t seem to have been intentional on their part — the time-stranded X-Men seem flummoxed by it, and as Bishop describes it, “something or someone yanked our friends through time.” Being a time traveler himself, Bishop would know. </p>
<p id="cAtyv3">So the second season of <em>X-Men ’97</em> looks to be separating itself into three plot lines — at least to start with — set in Egypt’s ancient past, Earth’s far future, and the present day. And if we bring in some X-Men comics knowledge, it’s clear that all of these plots arc back to the villain Apocalypse. </p>

<p id="ODscZ4">Rogue, Nightcrawler, Beast, Professor X, and Magento seem to be stranded in the ancient past, just in time to interact with the origin story of Apocalypse. The big, blue-faced X-Men villain who believes mutantkind must be put through rigorous “survival of the fittest”-based challenges in order to claim their dominance over humans began his immortal existence as an ancient Egyptian man. </p>

<p id="V5dOXI">Cyclops and Jean are stranded 2,000 years in the future, in the time of Clan Askani, a group of rebel fighters resisting the (<em>ahem</em>) post-apocalyptic rule of Apocalypse. In the comics, the Askani’s timeline is where baby Cable was sent, in the hopes that the future might hold the cure to his techno-organic virus, and Cable was received there as a kind of messianic child — his time-travel confirmed destiny being to put an end to Apocalypse’s reign. </p>
<p id="5W5NUG"><em>Also</em>, in the comics, Mother Askani (who is actually Scott and Jean’s grown-up daughter from yet another timeline, but don’t worry about it) used her own mutant gift of time manipulation to pull Cyclops and Jean into the future so that they could actually raise their own son there, before returning to the present day as if no time had passed. Cable’s presence here — as the teenage Nathan — indicates that <em>X-Men ’97</em> will be taking its own swing at that story, called <em>The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix</em>. </p>

<p id="AV6Bnw">Season 1’s finale credits scene brings us back to Apocalypse in the present, and gives us a big hint at the future of all those really juicy, loved, or love-to-hate X-Men characters — like Gambit, Emma Frost, and Sebastian Shaw — who died on Genosha. </p>
<p id="Ojmfng">“So much pain, my children,” Apocalypse orates over one of Gambit’s playing cards. “So much <em>death</em>.” The odds of Apocalypse striking back at humanity for the fall of Genosha seem likely, and that he’ll resurrect some of Genosha’s dead as his Four Horsemen seems inevitable. </p>
<p id="b8dCGl">So as the X-Men search for their friends from the present, its seems they’ll have to contest with Apocalypse’s plans as well. </p>
<p id="duMKdO">Oh and then there’s the matter of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151961/wolverine-x-men-97-adamantium-ripped-out-comics">Wolverine’s bones</a>. </p>
<h2 id="1F73KC"><strong>When does X-Men ’97 season 2 come out?</strong></h2>
<p id="nvdxpa">Work on the season 2 finale had already begun <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/sdcc-2023-marvel-studios-x-men-97-update">as of July 2023</a>, and development on a third season was soon to begin <a href="https://ew.com/x-men-97-beau-demayo-firing-marvel-animation-responds-8609643">as of this past March</a>. Before beginning production on season 3, however, Marvel Animation will be searching for a new showrunner, after the studio “<a href="https://ew.com/x-men-97-beau-demayo-firing-marvel-animation-responds-8609643">parted ways</a>” with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/marvel-shocker-x-men-97-creator-beau-demayo-fired-1235850423/">writer Beau DeMayo</a>.</p>
<p id="Ps3LMr">That being the case, and judging from how Disney usually spaces out its Disney Plus offerings, it seems likely we could see <em>X-Men ’97 </em>season 2 in 2025. </p>

In a perfect world, players wouldn’t have to emulate N64 games. Instead, these classic games would be available to play natively on a computer, as we saw with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-64s-unofficial-pc-port-will-look-glorious-once-mo-1843859269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-64s-unofficial-pc-port-will-look-glorious-once-mo-1843859269"><em>Super Mario 64</em>'s PC port</a></span>. This allows for better performance and visual improvements, plus it makes the games more accessible to more players. However, decompiling an N64 game and getting it to run on a computer is no easy task, and that limits which games will get PC ports.

Simply download the .exe, tell it where the ROM is located on your PC, hit play, and boom, you have a native PC port of<em> Majora’s Mask</em>, complete with an easy-to-use in-game menu that lets you change many settings on the fly.

Even better, these recompiled ports can be improved with ray-tracing and other visual enhancements, too. </p><p>In theory (with a few exceptions), almost every N64 game can be recompiled using this tool and made playable on PC with a few tweaks. And most users won’t ever have to use the tool, as they’ll just download a small program that was pre-made by a modder, add their ROM, and that’s it. But if you have a bit of computer knowledge, you could port any of your favorite N64 games to  PC in a matter of minutes.</p><p>This new tool won’t make decompiled ports, like the <em>Mario 6</em>4 PC port we saw a few years ago, worthless as those more advanced ports will offer more modding options and ways to tweak the game directly. However, for most people, a recompiled N64 port will get the job done and let them quickly and easily replay practically any classic game from that era on their PC. What a world we live in. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-map-is-%E2%80%98around-the-same-size%E2%80%99-as-origins%E2%80%99-egypt-map.871974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been confirmed by Ubisoft that the map of Japan for Assassin’s Creed Shadows is ‘around the same size’ as the Egyptian map featured in 2017’s Assassin’s Creed Origins. The latter title was the first ‘super-sized’ Assassin’s Creed game, bringing about a change in the formula that stripped away what previously existed and replaced it with an open-world RPG style of gameplay.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with IGN, it was claimed that AC Shadows won’t be as large as Valhalla or Odyssey, but it’s on par with Assassin’s Creed Origins.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-still-huge">That’s Still Huge</h2>



<p>Last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage was praised globally because of it being a ‘return to form’ for the franchise, boasting a smaller, denser map that was a wonder to explore. It meant that users could tackle everything the game offered without worrying about pouring hundreds of hours into it – and even I, with my very limited time, managed to 100% the game.</p>



<p>It seems like Ubisoft is pivoting entirely on that short-form concept and returning instantly to the broader, more epic maps that we’ve come to know and (partially) love from the Assassin’s Creed series of late.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japan-set-assassins-creed-shadows-is-around-the-same-size-as-assassins-creed-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with IGN</a>,  Ubisoft’s creative director, Jonathan Dumont, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s in-line with the latest Assassin’s Creeds that we’ve done. On a scale level, maybe we can compare it a little bit more to the size of Assassin’s Creed Origins. We did want to have a much closer to real life scale ratio. So because castles took a lot of space, and we really wanted the mountains to feel like mountains, we’ve made the environments feel wider in the game. But I would say around the same size as Origins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Origins still feels massive to this day, incorporating the entirety of Egypt from border to border. It’s a staggering map but a beautiful one, and it wasn’t as ‘packed’ with things to do as Valhalla was, for example. That helped it feel less daunting. In 2020, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was released, becoming the most ambitious AC game ever made. If you want to complete everything this gargantuan game has to offer, you’ll be playing for a good two hundred hours or more. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes players to Feudal Japan and allows them to take control of a Shinobi and a Samurai. It’s an operating model that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-will-work-like-ac-syndicate/">was seen in 2015’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</a>, and in the first trailer that was released recently by Ubisoft, it looks like a killer dynamic that’ll make for an interesting gameplay loop.</p>



<p>Are you bored of big-map Assassin’s Creed games?</p>

<p>While it received a rather lukewarm response due to a lack of direction and relatively tame design choices overall, Starfield continues to receive support from developer Bethesda Game Studios. In the latest release, the Starfield May Update, we’ll see numerous quality-of-life features, display setting tweaks, and improvements across the board.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-biggest-features-in-the-starfield-may-update">What Are the Biggest Features in the Starfield May Update?</h2>



<p>There are so many bug fixes, improvements, and new bits of content to explore in the Starfield May update that we can’t list everything here. But the most prominent features include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Improved surface maps</strong></li>



<li><strong>Inventory navigation tabs</strong></li>



<li><strong>New gameplay options under Settings</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ship Decorations</strong></li>



<li><strong>Change Traits and Appearance after Unity</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dialogue camera toggles</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X display settings improvements</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Personally, I’m most excited about the improved surface maps, which allow us to properly navigate the game’s cities and settlements with greater ease. But in a close second, the ship decorations will consume much of my time. The one feature I wanted most from the ship customization and construction feature in Starfield was the ability to personalize the interior of my ship. I want to fly the Serenity, damn it!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-starfield-may-update">How Big is the Starfield May Update?</h2>



<p>If you’re preparing to play the game today after work or school, you might want someone to download the Starfield May update on your behalf. It’s not the biggest update, but it clocks<strong> around 15 GB</strong>. </p>



<p>You can download and install the update on a relatively quick internet connection in ten to fifteen minutes. But not everyone is lucky enough to have fast internet, and then there are data caps to consider, so plan ahead, explorers!</p>

<p>As someone who genuinely enjoyed Starfield from the get-go, I think it was always a fun experience and worth playing. However, I completely understand everyone’s reservations. It occasionally felt empty and soulless. To their credit, however, Bethesda continues to work on the game and improve it significantly, and this new update is a testament to their resolve. </p>



<p>The May update includes so many highly requested quality-of-life features, like city maps, that it’s worth diving in again for another playthrough!</p>
