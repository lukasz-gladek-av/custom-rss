		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> was one of the great surprises of last year (or this year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/15/what-does-ps5-pro-give-you-in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/">if you only have a PS5</a>). It was a great romp that found its own distinctive take on the archaeological, mythological adventuring games that the films helped inspire, and playing in first person with a few moments of third person worked far better than I and many others might have expected. And now it’s time for a little bit more of that with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-coming-out-in-september/">The Order of Giants</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™: The Order of Giants" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD9Q3nIpMqQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it appears on the main menu, selecting this brings up an explanation card to state that The Order of Giants has simply been brought into the existing story with the appearance of Father Ricci off to the side of the Vatican City map. Speaking to him, he ropes you into his investigation of the legend of the Nameless Warrior, a very tall, giant warrior that took part in the Siege of Antioch, with a relic of his having been hidden away by one of those old Popes. Alas, the Blackshirts have stomped in and are blocking his return to the treasury, so it’s time for Indy to get a bit sneaky. Or not.</p>


<p>Stepping into this situation is a little bit different, depending on how far you’ve got through the main story. With the game already completed, and having thoroughly explored all of its areas, I could simply disguise myself as a Blackshirt and wander through to get to where I wanted, basically unchecked. Similarly, there’s little new here in terms of gameplay mechanics, no new gadget to use, and no real requirement to have the tools earned in Gizeh or Sukhothai from the main story, just because of when and where you’re able to access this side quest.</p>
<p>That placement, I feel, also comes to affect the story itself. I’ve no idea whether or not Locus was planned to appear in this story prior to Tony Todd’s passing, but since he was the one real tie to the secretive Nephilim Order, and we’re now investigating more tales of giants from history, it’s a tad odd that this tale is completely standalone.</p>


<p>But the mystery does deepen in a satisfying fashion as we reunite with Ricci and deduce that we need to go spelunking through the Cloaca Maxima, the giant sewer network that runs under Rome, in order to find the latest puzzling MacGuffin. Thankfully we can use a boat to get around and avoid getting into the putrid water too often –&nbsp;I hope Indy’s got some travel insurance for his inevitable hospital stay after this –&nbsp;and as we find new branches to explore and open up new areas, there’s both encounters with a red-robed Cult of Mithras and some nice brain-teasing puzzles.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the puzzle rooms here, as they just go one or two steps beyond the obvious to give satisfying conclusions. Taking pictures of a Latin inscription and then reading the translations in Indy’s journal to interpret their clues, but then having to relate these back to a blend of visual and written marks on a map was a nice one. So too was a Pipemania style puzzle, helping to navigate a ball through a maze while having to move connectors in real time. They’re not puzzles that will have you stumped for more than a few minutes, but they are enjoyable.</p>

<p>It all builds up to a big boss battle and, similar to the boss fights in the main game, I did find this a bit wearing. While the pugilism and fighting in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is often about getting in a hefty clonk to your opponent’s head, the grandest moments drag this out a bit too far for my tastes. In this instance, it got to the point for me where I felt I was probably doing the right thing to deal damage, but simply couldn’t tell in the moment –&nbsp;a quick hop across to YouTube confirmed that I was, and it proved I really was just a couple more hits away from completing the story.</p>
<p>While I do wish that The Order of Giants was more substantially linked to the main game or felt like it was pushing on with some new ideas, it also fits perfectly as another little episode in Indy’s Saturday matinee capers. It’s a shorter episode that you could almost view as a standalone adventure, and that’s great in its own way. If there were more expansions like this, I’d be all aboard, but I still hope for something a bit broader and more adventurous in the future.</p>

<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Joshua Bright" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e186a127c442/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-joshua-bright.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: GungHo Online</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, it looks like <strong>Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</strong> is absolutely happening, as a teaser that appears at the end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> has been doing the rounds online.</p>
<p>Shared on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/1nhol9e/trails_in_the_sky_sc_remake_teaser/">Reddit</a> and reported on by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-confirmed-could-release-a-lot-sooner-than-people-think">Push Square</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-teaser-trailer">Gematsu</a>), the teaser is hidden within the upcoming remake of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, which launches on Switch and Switch 2 this Friday, 19th September 2025.</p>
<p>If we had to guess, the teaser probably plays you've rolled credits. And for good reason; there are some pretty big 1st Chapter spoilers there.</p>
<p>We're not going to pop the video here, and we recommend you only watch it if you've played Trails in the Sky on PSP or PC before (and/or SC) or you don't care for spoilers, but if you're curious, go check out the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/1nhol9e/trails_in_the_sky_sc_remake_teaser/">Falcom subreddit</a>. Instead, have a look at last week's combat trailer to give you a little tease of the remake:</p>

<p>This shouldn't be surprising news, and we're sure Falcom will announce something once 1st Chapter releases, but Falcom president <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">Toshihiro Kondo has already hinted at the sequel's existence</a> just a few weeks ago.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sony/">Sony</a> game development studios have already used its Enterprise LLM AI tool to develop some of its games, but the company is set to make these tools a support for creativity rather than a substitute.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">2025 Corporate Report</a>, the Japanese company laid out its plans for AI usage in game development, confirming it has already been used in some capacity to support the development of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with the use of <em>"voice recognition software specialized for games to make simultaneous subtitling<br>automatic in some languages"</em>, and to test some models using Horizon series protagonist Aloy. Since 2023, over 50,000 people in 210 different teams within the company have started using the Enterprise LLM tool, which helps them use AI safely for chat or writing help and connect it with daily work tools. With a focus on potential legal, privacy, and ethics issues, Sony aims to make AI a safe support for creativity, and not a substitute for developers, to accelerate and streamline the development process, such as improving image quality with upscaling tech, which the company is already doing with the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler.</p>



<p>The use of AI in video game development has been a hot topic of discussion for quite some time, and some developers have highlighted in the past few months how it can help a large-scale development process that is progressively becoming less and less sustainable for various reasons. Back in June, Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai highlighted how game development has to change to remain sustainable and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">AI can be used to improve efficiency</a>, which mirrors Sony’s vision of using AI to streamline the development process, as outlined in the 2025 Corporate Report</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/voyagers-of-nera-preview-low-key-tropical-survival.1299111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Quite a few survival crafting games take place in a tropical setting, and they each have their own spin on the formula — whether it's aiming for realism or leaning more toward a fantasy adventure. In this&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;preview, I'll go over the good (and the bad) of this latest survival crafting experience from Treehouse Games.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="733ce2a9-3d2e-4af6-88be-c6f61d51c3a1" href="https://techraptor.net/games/voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow"><em>Voyagers of Nera</em></a>&nbsp;is the first title from Treehouse Games, a remote-first game developer. Players take on the role of an "Echo," a long-dormant guardian who has awoken to a world in chaos. Now, it's up to you and your friends to rescue lost spirits and defeat monstrous creatures of all sizes across the land.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-rescuing-a-guide-spirit-during-the-voyagers-of-nera-preview.jpg?itok=nb61hQgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-rescuing-a-guide-spirit-during-the-voyagers-of-nera-preview.jpg?itok=Vm9hWfeD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most Guide Spirits are held hostage by a few waves of leveled enemies that must be defeated before you can rescue it.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Spiritual Awakening</h2>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is fairly light on story, at least in its Early Access launch version. You've been hibernating for a long time, and the world has gone to hell in a handbasket in your absence; now it's up to you to rescue lost <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="534397b6-4f38-40c6-ae79-440c3d125e7c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-spirits-guide-locations-and-unlocks" rel="nofollow">"Guide Spirits"</a> and set things right.</p>

<p>The first hour or so of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is standard fare for a survival crafting game tutorial; you learn basic movement and combat as you rescue a Guide Spirit from enemies. Once that's done, you emerge from the temple to find yourself on a beach with a massive stone arm lying in the distance — welcome to The Embrace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Voyagers of Nera is fairly casual on the "survival" part of the survival crafting genre.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your first step is to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56fa317b-b55f-42a0-9cbf-d09be5ab7c39" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-crafting-guide" rel="nofollow">craft</a> some basic tools and build a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="be6a37b3-059c-47bf-8104-2c8465fec5ab" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-spirit-anchor-guide" rel="nofollow">Spirit Anchor</a>. The Spirit Anchor is a massive stone monument that protects the area around <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3851694e-9f68-40f0-81ae-37d0afb04802" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-building-guide" rel="nofollow">your base</a> and gives rescued Guide Spirits a safe haven from the forces of darkness. As you build out your base, you'll level up and gain the ability to unlock new items in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dce045aa-68df-4c7c-8a1c-37d65afb5e6c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-knowledge-unlocks-guide" rel="nofollow">Knowledge Tree</a>.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is fairly casual on the "survival" part of the survival crafting genre.

As long as you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in, you won't have to worry too much about maintaining your health.</p>

<p>The Early Access launch version of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;has <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="695708b2-0456-4bfc-aca7-983b8bff8b6b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-map-and-locations-guide" rel="nofollow">a map</a> that is split into three distinctive regions: The Embrace, The Reef, and The Greatwood. These areas are separated by masses of rocks known as "The Deep," filled with a corrupting aura and stalked by a massive sea monster that can tear you to pieces.</p>

<p>You can travel from island to island within a region by running, swimming, or using a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02803ce6-aafd-4617-8ce2-79760299d79c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-skimmer-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">Skimmer</a>&nbsp;(which is essentially a magical surfboard), but you'll almost certainly need a proper boat to travel between the major regions.</p>

<p>Both of the available <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe7167a1-adba-4d35-bc38-08e684a14e7e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-boat-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">boats</a> are fairly large, and it can be difficult to navigate some of the tighter waterways. It's especially challenging to use a boat as a solo player since you'll need to raise the sail to gain speed and then move to the rudder to steer it. It appears that the bigger boats are intended to be piloted by a crew of two people.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you only really <em>need</em>&nbsp;boats for traveling between regions or moving large amounts of cargo; you can get by traveling within a region using your Skimmer and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e1baf40-feae-4feb-a2a1-0a7c3829dbba" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-glider-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">glider</a>. Still, it would have been nice to have a larger boat with some cargo space that could be piloted by a solo player more easily.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-fighting-a-construct-in-ruins-in-voyagers-of-nera.jpg?itok=_YVXYzdw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-fighting-a-construct-in-ruins-in-voyagers-of-nera.jpg?itok=E1jmxzW8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each region has 3 ruins that must explore to free a fragment of an Elder Spirit, usually by defeating a "Construct" in combat.</figcaption></figure><h2>Swimming in Circles</h2>

<p>However you travel, your ultimate goal is to rescue the Guide Spirits of the world one by one. Each rescued Guide Spirit powers up your base just a little more, allowing you to use new crafting stations to better equip you for the more difficult zones.</p>

<p>You can explore the world to find Guide Spirits on your own. You'll get a warning message that a nearby spirit is in danger when you're close, but it can be difficult to find them sometimes. Fortunately, the Spirit Anchor can be used to point you to a Guide Spirit in the region that you have not yet rescued.</p>

<p>Regrettably, it appears that the Spirit Anchor can only point you to one unrescued Guide Spirit at a time, and that results in a somewhat predictable gameplay loop: find a Guide Spirit, rescue it, return home, and use the Spirit Anchor to find the location of the next Guide Spirit to rescue.</p>

<p>Your quest to rescue the Guide Spirits is dragged out by a lack of useful fast travel. You can build an <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="35964fa7-4053-43a1-87dc-1661b562379a" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-ancients-gate-guide" rel="nofollow">Ancient's Gate</a> to easily travel between two bases, but you can only have a handful of bases total. As far as I can tell, there is no item to quickly teleport you back to your base in the game yet, either.</p>

<p>There isn't much preventing you from building a boat and sailing all the way to the last region, although that's ill-advised; as you might expect, enemies get progressively tougher as you move to each subsequent region. You can't rescue most Guide Spirits if you're not equipped to kill the enemies holding them hostage.</p>

<p>You're also limited to only one base until you level up your Spirit Anchor. Currently, you're limited to a maximum of four Spirit Anchors; that's just enough for one base in each region, plus a spare. You can build wherever you like, but the functionality of a base is hamstrung without the multitude of buffs a Spirit Anchor provides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Voyagers of Nera's world is fairly wide, it feels seomwhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The meat of the game is rescuing Guide Spirits, leveling up your Knowledge Tree to craft more gear, and eventually progressing to more difficult regions. Each region introduces new enemies and new obstacles for you to face, so there's a serviceable amount of variety in the combat challenges you'll encounter.</p>

<p>That said, there isn't much beyond the core gameplay loop of alternating between rescuing Guide Spirits and crafting better gear. Although <i>Voyagers of Nera's</i>&nbsp;world is fairly wide, it feels somewhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my time exploring the world of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>. I had fun exploring the islands and rescuing Guide Spirits, but the lack of things to do between those core gameplay objectives made it feel a little light on meaningful, engaging content.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;could be a great survival game once it has matured a bit, expanded on its features, and added a little more variety in its gameplay. Unless you're dead set on playing it, it's probably best to hold off on playing this game&nbsp;until it has a couple of major content updates under its belt.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Voyagers of Nera</strong><em>&nbsp;was previewed over approximately 99 hours of gameplay on PC via&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2686630/Voyagers_of_Nera/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>&nbsp;with a key provided by the publisher.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-playfully-revives-nintendo-rivalry-in-new-sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer.1299105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released a brand new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, and it contains some not-so-subtle jabs at racing rival&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, as well as Sega's general history of rivalry with Nintendo.</p>

<p>In the trailer (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-references-its-past-feud-with-nintendo-in-shady-ad-comparing-sonic-racing-crossworlds-and-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), we see a TV, on which a heavily pixelated kart racing game is being played. It's pretty obviously&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and the camera quickly pans to a much more sophisticated TV, on which&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>appears.</p>

<p>Quickly, the&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>TV is attached to a sleek, speedy racing car, while the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>TV, as seemingly befits its low-tech status, is hitched to a juddering RV. Just in case you needed some extra help, the RV is pictured next to a tortoise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=BvrNJDPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=haSK0OWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>&nbsp;ad isn't exactly subtle.</figcaption></figure><p>The ad closes with an invitation to players to "come race on our level", and in the trailer's description, Sega recommends players "leave the open road behind", which seems to me to be a pretty obvious jab at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct" rel="nofollow">open...well, world</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that Sega is poking fun at the old rivalry between itself and Nintendo, which primarily existed throughout the fourth and fifth console generations (and, partially, the sixth, before the Dreamcast sank without a trace and the PS2 ascended into the heavens).</p>

<p>It's the beef that gave rise to the legendary "Genesis does what Nintendon't" slogan, and while there's nothing quite so direct on offer here, it's fun to see Sega back to its old prickly self, even if it is just for a few moments.</p>

<p>You can check out the playful and fun new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>ad right here. Just don't write any hate mail to Sega about how Nintendo is clearly better (or vice versa) once you're done, OK?</p>




<p><i>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</i>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-racing-crossworlds/9NMR17QTLC33" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-racing-crossworlds-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on September 25th, and a release for Switch 2 is also planned for this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony’s next <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">PlayStation showcase</a> might be sooner than some expected. A new State of Play is reportedly planned for later this month, pegged to Tokyo Game Show 2025. There’s certainly no shortage of things The PlayStation 5 maker could show off, including that rumored update on Insomniac Games’ <em>Wolverine</em>.</p> <p>Podcaster and leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1967788911180263523">spilled the beans</a> on X early on Tuesday. It began the night before when people started asking him for information about when Sony’s next showcase would be. “Sony has a presentation soon,” he replied cryptically. Then earlier today he elaborated, “Next week.” NateTheHate’s had a good track record ever since he accurately reported on the Switch 2 reveal earlier this year, and a PlayStation event pegged to Tokyo Game Show would make sense.</p> <p>Sega <a href="https://tgs.sega.jp/2025/en/lineup/">recently teased</a> its TGS lineup with four secret slots for unannounced games that are “coming soon.” Capcom, Square Enix, and other Japanese publishers will have a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/square-enix-announces-tgs-2025-lineup-schedule">big presence</a> at the show as well, though fans have already begun speculating about what else could get announced during it. The reported State of Play adds some weight to the possibility of something big, like a tease for the third part of the<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII</em> remake series, or the rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> remaster. At the very least, we might finally get updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em> and <em>Dragon Quest XII</em>.</p>

 <p>As for what Sony might bring to a State of Play, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> recently</a> reported that the next trailer for <em>Wolverine</em> is complete and all but guaranteed to appear in the next PlayStation State of Play. That would be good news for players waiting to see more of Insomniac’s next Marvel project after years of silence and ahead of a rumored launch in 2026, though a TGS-adjacent showcase also seems like a weird venue to show off new footage compared to, say, The Game Awards.</p> <p>We’re also due for an update on <em>Marathon</em>. Bungie’s extraction shooter was originally scheduled to come out this month before getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">indefinitely delayed</a> following mixed feedback on an alpha test earlier this year. The studio promised fans would get a new release date announced sometime in the fall, and Sony has still claimed the live-service game will launch before the end of March 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-review.1299090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's nothing exciting here, but it's still more content for a great game.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed expansions come in two flavors: straightforward follow ups that elaborate on the drama and intrigue of the main game, or completely bonkers flights of fancy that turn everything upside down by adding unicorns or dragging you to Asgard. Shadows’ expansion, Claws of Awaji, is firmly the former, almost to a fault. Naoe gets some new combat tricks thanks to a whole new weapon type, and the general pace of exploration is made more hectic and tense as enemies are way more dangerous and way more motivated to bring the fight to you. But the land itself doesn’t feel much different than the rest of Japan, and the straightforward adventure is light on revelation and doesn’t make too great a case for its own existence.</p>The story that carries our heroes off of the mainland and onto the island is much like that of the main game, filled with colorful characters and a shadowy group of conspirators that need to be brought down systematically, but it’s a simple and predictable tale on the whole. It does pick up the threads of Naoe’s missing mother and the growing influence of the Templar order in Japan, but it doesn’t do much to tie those up in satisfying ways by the end. It also doesn’t make much of a case for seeing anymore of this world. For all Valhalla’s faults, each expansion felt like it was introducing a new dimension to the greater world that Eivor and friends occupied. Claws ends, and 16th century Japan doesn’t feel much bigger than it did 10 hours before it.<output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Awaji Island is just as beautiful as the rest of Japan, but it’s not so significantly different from the mainland that a person who hasn’t already spent 60+ hours playing would be able to spot the difference at first glance, unlike when Eivor went to Ireland in Valhalla, for instance. Awaji is a bit more mountainous, which is more noticeable when having to navigate up and down the length of the map because of the significant lack of fast travel points throughout. And there are some visual gems hidden away like a dark swamp with creepy foliage, or a big warship that’s under construction. But if you’ve seen a mountain caked in winter snow earlier this year, this will look exactly like that. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’ve seen a mountain caked in winter snow earlier this year, this will look exactly like that.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more of the same kinds of side quests and activities to do on Awaji as well, which is good for gaining knowledge points to invest in the limited amount of new skills and upgrades available to Naoe and Yasuke, but still pretty optional and ignorable otherwise. Side quests seem even more tucked away than the main game – I didn’t come across any of them organically and had to put extra effort into finding people with problems I can solve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe gets her hands on a new weapon in Claws of Awaji, the bo staff. Fashioned as a hybrid of a long-ranged crowd controller and a single-target mix-up machine, I found it to be much better at the latter than the former. This is mostly because of its novel stance-based attacks, using high jabs to interrupt enemies and low sweeps to take them off their feet and open them up to big, reliable damage. On the off chance I got into extended brawls as the Shinobi, the bo was reliably my second slot choice.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are new skills for both Yasuke and Naoe, but I didn’t find them to be particularly spicy.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are new skills for both Yasuke and Naoe as well but I didn’t find them to be particularly spicy enough to unseat my tried-and-true staples tested under dozens of hours of chopping and stabbing. Some new equipment is available to plunder from castles but as it was in the base game, these aren’t really much of a carrot worth chasing unless you really love having all of the icons on the map cleared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The island of Awaji is thick with opportunities to put all of your skills and gear to the test. It’s dense with folks who at best don’t trust you, or at worse would travel far and wide for a chance to kill you. I felt I was being hunted and conspired against much more than in the base game. Every horse trip longer than 100 meters left me exposed to road traps set by enemy ninja. City guards are much jumpier and more suspicious, and will not hesitate to start a melee in the middle of the market to take you down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The general chaos of the island cleverly married with the main quest’s objectives.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I liked how the general chaos of the island cleverly married with the main quest’s objectives to take down the three trusted taisho of the Templar leader in the region. For instance, those road side ninja? They work for Nowaki, a gun-toting hunter that is terrorizing the region for sport. Stopping to take them out instead of avoiding them gives you the chance to run their pockets for clues to where their master might be hiding. Those jumpy guards all answer to Tomeji, the beefy vanguard that enforces order with an iron fist. He’s very conspicuous in a castle surrounded by his elite guard but picking fights and causing general ruckus will compel him to send those guards out to stop you. And when they don’t return on account of you retiring them early, he’s left more and more vulnerable to your inevitable siege. Using your scouts to track down objectives will put the search zone on high alert thanks to the third big bad on the island: a shadowy spymaster of a thousand aliases. It’s a strange harmony that might have been obnoxious in the larger adventure but is a welcome challenge when considering Claws’ relative brevity.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green's Top 10 Assassin's Creed Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When the main quest missions come to crescendos that require the team to work together more directly, Claws of Awaji still splits the tasks up between Yasuke and Naoe appropriately, leaving Yasuke to do much of the open combat, and Naoe to take stealth and assassination duty. The handful of new boss fights also do a good job of playing to the pair's individual strengths, including a very cool stealth battle that kind of evokes Metal Gear Solid and demands all of Naoe’s skills to overcome.
</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows brought some much needed promise and energy that the series was lacking, and the Claws of Awaji expansion doesn’t really move that needle much in either direction. Its forgettable story and lack of new interesting side distractions don’t detract from how fun it is to ride through the tumultuous badlands of the region using brute force and subterfuge to take down yet another dark cabal of evil doers. But it doesn’t make the strong case for the necessity of any more epilogues, either.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>The Claws of Awaji doesn't add anything exciting to Assassin's Creed Shadows, but it's still fun to explore a new region and stab people.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Randy Pitchford has continued his social media push to address complaints about the performance of the PC version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, telling some disgruntled players they can get a Steam refund if they’re unhappy with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Borderlands 4’s huge Steam launch last week, Pitchford has issued <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/randy-pitchford-addresses-borderlands-4-console-fov-slider-complaints-theres-some-dreams-i-have-where-an-fov-setting-might-affect-fairness"><u>confusing comments on why the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a field of view (FOV) slider</u></a>, promised <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-that-confident-randy-pitchford-says-its-impossible-for-borderlands-4-players-to-break-the-games-servers-this-weekend-challenges-them-to-try"><u>that it would have been impossible to break the Borderlands 4 servers through sheer weight of player numbers alone</u></a>, told people to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies">“code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please,”</a> and declared Borderlands 4 “a premium game made for premium gamers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s the truth of the matter? Borderlands 4 is currently on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around performance. The tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> have said <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting">which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the outspoken Gearbox chief is showing no signs of backing down, issuing tweet after tweet in response to direct complaints about how Borderlands 4 runs. Most of the tweets offer direct advice about how to make Borderlands 4 run better - which is of course a perfectly reasonable thing to do - and call for players to put their irrational distrust of video game graphics tech such as DLSS aside and use it if available to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Pitchford, perhaps showing a touch of frustration about the discourse around Borderlands 4, has issued some spicier responses, pointing to the Steam refund system so players can get their money back, or suggesting fans wait for the game to be cheaper — or more powerful PC hardware to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not trying to argue either,” Pitchford said in one of his tweet responses. “I was offering to help you if you are not satisfied with your experience and want some help making trade offs. I'm trying to help users understand that the software is the software and there are options available right now for people who want to play right now to make significant and dramatic trade offs between fps, resolution, and graphics features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's for people who want to play now. People who want to play later can play later. People can even get a refund after buying and trying if they are not satisfied. Those are the options. My advice to users is to accept reality and tune, or to not play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are working more on the software, but the software will not radically change later. However, hardware will get better (just like some or all of your hardware probably didn't exist when Cyberpunk first launched). Do you feel you need help to achieve the trade-offs you're looking for? What kind of hardware are you using and what resolution are you trying to run at and what frame rate is acceptable to you?”</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other posts worth highlighting here because they give us an insight into Pitchford’s current mindset. After one person said he was being “unbelievably insufferable,” a non-plussed sounding Pitchford replied: “I'm trying to be helpful. What do you think would be helpful? What would you have me do?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like some PC gamers don’t like being told to use the likes of DLSS and frame generation generally to improve the performance of Borderlands 4 — and this is something Pitchford seems particularly keen to address. In multiple tweets he suggested playing with the aid of frame generation, although clearly this advice is falling on deaf ears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can do whatever you want,” <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford said in response to yet another complaint</a>. “The game is the game. Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/16/gettyimages-2165616825-1758023724911.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford is tweeting through Borderlands 4's PC performance backlash. Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then a typically evocative quote from the Gearbox boss: “You made an analogy to a vehicle. I would not put a Ferrari engine in a monster truck and expect it to drive like a Ferrari. If you tell me about your specification, I can help you optimize your performance. I'm sorry you don't like being told to use DLSS, but that is the way. If you're not happy using the tools available to you to improve frame rate and you're not happy with the frame rate you have, you should play a different game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game is awesome and it is designed to be just fine of an experience at 30fps and feel great at 60fps. We also have provided a lot of options for you to make different trade offs between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features than we would make and we encourage you to use those tools to optimize to your taste. Would you like help tuning your experience better to your liking?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967842598586028207" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another spicy take from the developer</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Do you want any help tuning your experience? Your other option is to not play or wait for future updates or newer hardware to come along down the road. The game will probably be cheaper in a couple of years, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967830314983768368" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“UE5 is the engine for Borderlands 4. There's nothing that can change that now. Shader compiling is necessary when you make changes to your graphics settings. I wish it was faster, but it is what it is. When you're done and set up, you won't have to wait the few moments for shaders to compile any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't believe I have denied any particular issues (except, generally, to say that the software is functioning as designed and is free from major defects that affect performance for the vast majority of configurations). What I have done and continue to do is recommend that users who want to play the game now and change the trade off between fps, resolution and graphics features take advantage of the tools provided to tune those things to your liking. Would you like help tuning your experience on your specific PC?”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so on and so forth. Is Pitchford causing more harm to Borderlands 4 than good here? Last month, I asked Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Gearbox parent company Take-Two, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death">whether he has a mini heart attack whenever Pitchford tweets anything</a>. In his response, Zelnick admitted Pitchford can be a controversial figure, and even suggested some of his antics are deliberate, but ultimately he’s a big fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love Randy, first of all. Let me just say that on the record,” Zelnick began. “And I love his big personality. I love his passion and he is one of the all time great game makers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> players have discovered an infinite damage build so broken it kills bosses in seconds — even on the hardest difficulty levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/nothing-is-safe-from-borderlands-4s-infinite-damage-build-that-wipes-out-bosses-in-less-than-10-seconds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, YouTuber NickTew <a href="https://youtu.be/C5FuLSM6CgM?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released gameplay</a> showing a Vex build that makes a mockery of Borderlands 4’s toughest enemies. And now the build is spreading like wildfire, fans are convinced Gearbox will soon nerf it into the ground. So, as NickTew suggested: “abuse it while you can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make this build work you need the Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator Augment. Land a hit with this knife and subsequent damage to the target are automatic critical hits for five seconds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the trick: add bleed stacking and each tick of the bleed effect registers as a critical hit. Yep, every one is a crit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s brilliant for every class, but it’s even better for <a href="https://maxroll.gg/borderlands-4/build-guides/vex-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vex</a> because of her Bloodletter passive. This makes your gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply bleed, which counts as gun damage and is based on the initial damage dealt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vex's Contamination passive adds to the carnage, because it causes critical hits to increase status effect application chance up to 100%, ensuring the bleed re-procs infinitely. So, throw the knife, land one big shot on the boss, and watch the numbers get bigger and bigger as the bleed ticks it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NickTew nukes a boss with a level 32 weapon on the Ultimate Vault Hunter Level 5 difficulty, just to show how effective the build really is. This difficulty means enemies have an additional 350% HP, and the boss still goes down in seconds.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is, a knife with this augment is a rare find (hopefully you didn't sell or drop one you picked up early game!), so you’ll probably need to do some farming to get it (Splashzone seems like a good shout). Once done, though, the build is essentially complete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

It just trivialises the game to the point that the guns don’t even matter anymore. Just apply the penetrator debuff and bleed and then watch it go exponential in damage. Probably not an interaction the devs picked up on in balance testing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has a lot to contend with right now, including improving performance (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies">while Randy Pitchford tweets through it</a>), adding a field of view (FOV) slider to the console version, and working on post-launch content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Additionally, Team Cherry is looking to address several issues around specific tools in the game.</p><p>There's no release date yet for the patch, but it is being tested in the public-beta branch of Silksong, and overall, you can expect tweaks and fixes across the board. For example, the Savage Beastfly in Far Fields won't be tempting fate by being too close to lava, a softlock issue that occurred with Shaman Binding has been fixed, and an issue with the break-counter not working for certain multi-hitter tools has also been resolved. Players can also visit the <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/help" rel="nofollow ">Silksong help site</a> to see what the temporary solutions are for critical bugs.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-playstation-5-crossplay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valheim-coming-to-playstation-5-next-year-crossplay-confirmed.1299048/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>developer Iron Gate Studios has announced that its Viking survival game is heading to PlayStation 5 sometime next year, and what's more, it'll fully support crossplay as well.</p>

<p>This news was revealed in <a href="https://valheim.com/news/valheim-is-coming-to-playstation-/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the game's official website, where Iron Gate also announces that it's collaborating with support studio Piktiv (which also helped out with the PC Game Pass and Microsoft Store versions of the game) for the PS5 release.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Iron Gate doesn't disclose a release date for the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, but the studio does say that Piktiv's work will allow it to "continue to focus on developing the Deep North and 1.0", so perhaps the PlayStation 5 launch will coincide with one of those updates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valheim-playstation-5-2026.jpg?itok=rZKbM5ZF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valheim-playstation-5-2026.jpg?itok=3NWEYxV9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>is making its way to PS5 next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The Deep North biome may not be ready for primetime yet, but&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>&nbsp;did receive a fairly major update in the form of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/529856925490219058" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Call to Arms</a> last week. It brought numerous changes to combat and Forsaken Powers, as well as new trinkets, new creatures, and more.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafter set in the titular Norse realm, which is an invention created specifically for the game. Together with your friends (or solo if you dare), you must prove to Odin that you're fit to join him in the halls of Valhalla.</p>

<p>To do so, you'll need to carve out a life for yourself in the realm of Valheim, slaying its various denizens and surviving by gathering the resources you find across its varied biomes. You'll be crafting weapons, exploring the world around you, and taking advantage of the game's "flexible building system" to construct bases.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/valheim-game-preview/9ncbl78cg9n7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also available as part of a Game Pass subscription. The game is due to land on PS5 sometime next year.</p>

            <p>Be very, very quiet. Yes, I know this is being yelled from a page on a video game website that at least five people have heard of, so it's hardly hush-hush, but if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">Randy keeps shouting unhinged things at people about PC specs</a>, I think we might slip under the radar.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> build. It's a bit broken, and can reportedly down bosses in a click of your fingers by doing a craptonne of damage. I am telling you this information now. The game's director is aware of the quirk at the heart of this slapping-up setup, and I've a sneaking suspicion it might be tweaked soon.</p>

<p>The build in question, as you'd expect for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, involves knives. Vex's knives, to be exact. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/nothing-is-safe-from-borderlands-4s-infinite-damage-build-that-wipes-out-bosses-in-less-than-10-seconds/">Percival Celebration Gamer</a> and shown off by TuYouber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5FuLSM6CgM">NickTew</a>, it's possible to set up the Siren in a fashion that can one-shot bosses even at higher difficulty levels.</p>
<p>You'll need a Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator augment. They're pretty rare, so you may need to rummage through your cupboards. The domino that kicks off the chain is you lobbing that at the enemy before you do anything else. Next, let me introduce you to Vex. She's got a couple of handy passive skills - Bloodletter and Contamination. The former means her gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply a bleed effect, which combines with the knife here to make each tick of bleed do critical damage.</p><p>On top of that, Contamination kicks in to make critical hits increase your chance of status effect application to 100%. Cue bleed damage causing <em>more</em> bleeds to spring up on the poor enemy, and you have numbers that'll keep going until your foe keels over, probably while mumbling something about you being a tryhard.</p>
<p>It worth noting that according to NickTew, the knife doesn't appear to work this way if you're playing co-op and more than one person lobs one, seemingly because the two sets of bleeds caused "will overwrite each other".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Chill guys, we're not going to knee jerk react to anything.

<p>The hangup with this build, aside from the rareness of the knife, is that it looks likely to be patched out or significantly nerfed soon. Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1967299997558587410">replied to a tweet</a> about Vex's bleed being a bit too powerful the other day. He was quick to declare that the studio are "not going to knee jerk react to anything", but did add that this looks similar to a bug that afflicted fellow Vault Hunters Harlow and Rafa prior to release. That one "actually crashed the game and/or froze the UI", so the devs are investigating to see if there are any stability issues being caused by Vex's potent phlebotomy.</p>
<p>Oh no, I think Randy heard me type stability issues! You'd better scurry off before he infiltrates the treehouse and shouts something about the futility of trying to run his game on a toaster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Split Protective Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ec9c5197beea8/split-protective-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you managed to check out our review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Genki’s Attack Vector Case</a> for the Switch 2, then JSAUX’s <strong>Split Protection Case</strong> will look pretty familiar.</p>
<p>It adopts the same modular approach, with a main case clipping onto the back of the device, and two grips encompassing the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The difference here, however, is that JSAUX’s product comes with a fourth additional case that clips onto the front of the Switch 2, enclosing the entire device and thus theoretically providing decent protection while traveling.</p>
<p>Every segment included is easy to apply. The Joy-Con cases snap on from the outer sides, the back panel clips onto the top and bottom edges of the main console, and the front panel folds over the shoulder buttons before clipping onto the bottom. Interestingly, you can’t just use the front panel on its own; you have to have the back on first, otherwise there’s simply not enough material for the front panel to clip on to.</p>

<p>What’s nice is that, like the Genki case, the modular design lets you remove the Joy-Con controllers from the console with the casing clipped on, and the back panel is also slim enough to dock the Switch 2 as normal. There is a slight catch with this, though.</p>
<p>JSAUX warns about a noise that occurs when docking the Switch with the back panel attached. It says this is normal, and it probably is, but as someone who looks after their gadgets to an almost obsessive degree, this ‘normal noise’ – which is basically a dull clicking sound – makes my skin crawl. As such, I’ve opted to remove the back panel when docking the console.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con grips are lovely, though. Although lacking in any kind of rubber grips, there is a rough texture applied to the exterior, and it feels pretty nice. The closest comparison is the slight texture applied to the official Xbox controllers, although it’s perhaps slightly more apparent on the JSAUX grips. Meanwhile, their shape hug your palms nicely, so it makes gaming in handheld mode considerably more comfortable.</p>

<p>My main issue with the Split Protector is with the front panel. When it’s actually attached to the console along with the rest of the casing, you really get a sense that the Switch 2 is well protected. That said, I’m not wholly convinced that it can provide adequate protection beyond a few scrapes and scratches. Since it clips onto the Switch 2 without much force, I can easily imagine it flying off again if you happen to drop your system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interior of the front panel contains slots in which to store your physical cartridges. They feel pretty secure when they’re inserted, and I feel confident that they’re not going anywhere, but I’m also conscious that the front panel is completely loose when removed from the device.You could say the same about any case, I suppose, but if you’re out and about and you remove the front panel – which may have up to ten cartridges stored within – that’s a <em>heck</em> of a lot to lose if you happen to misplace it or some heathen nicks it.</p>
<p>Call me paranoid, but having the cartridges on full show with nothing to conceal them makes me really nervous, and I think it would have been beneficial to be able to clip the front panel onto the back when in use, or at least include some way of hiding your cartridges once the panel is removed. As it is, I’m not fully prepared to take this thing on the road, and for true protection, I’d probably just opt for a more traditional case.</p>

			<p>Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> leaves much to be desired in terms of optimization, with the right settings, it is possible to achieve noticeable performance improvements on multiple GPUs with minimal impact on the visuals.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, MxBenchmarkPC compares how the new entry in the series by Gearbox runs and looks at various resolutions on multiple GPUs ranging from the RTX 5080 and 4080 to the dated RTX 3080 and 3060 GPUs using both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR with and without Frame Generation, highlighting how the used optimized setting don't look much different from the Very High settings preset and deliver much better performance, up to 40% in some scenarios.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Borderlands 4 Optimization - Up to 40% More FPS | RTX 5080, 5070, 4080, 4070, 4060, 3080, 3060" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HMAPk0Zmc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><em>Optimized Settings:<br>HLOD Loading Range: Far<br>Geometry Quality: High<br>Texture Quality: Very High (12GB), High (10GB), Medium (8GB)<br>Anisotropic Filtering Quality: x16<br>Foliage Density: High<br>Volumetric Fog: Medium<br>Volumetric Cloud: Medium<br>Shadow Quality: High<br>Directional Shadow Quality: High<br>Volumetric Cloud Shadows: Disabled<br>Lighting Quality: High<br>Reflections Quality: Medium<br>Shading Quality: Medium</em></p>



<p>Right at launch, it was clear how Borderlands 4 is among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/">most demanding games to run released this year</a>, and although it has already been patched with some performance and stability improvements, there's still a lot of work left to be done. The game's performance has prompted a heated discussion between users disappointed by how the game runs on their systems and Gearbox co-founder Randy Pitchford, who suggested that "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">4K stubborn" players</a> who don't have the hardware to play at that resolution should switch to 1440p resolution or take advantage of NVIDIA DLSS or other upscalers to achieve better performance. The discussion got so heated that Pitchford replied to one user telling the studio to make a game look good without AI upscale to <em>"code their own engine"</em> and show them how it's done.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is hardly going to be remembered as the finest entry in the series or the best open-world game set in Feudal Japan, but the good the game does definitely outweighs the bad, making for an enjoyable experience whose real fault lies in the series' now trademark content bloat and the by-the-book open-world ARPG experience rather than in the bad execution of any of its features.</p>



<p>Coming only a few months after the base game, no one should have expected the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji expansion to address any of the issues of the base game, and it doesn't, indeed. If anything, it makes abundantly clear how the quantity over quality approach behind the series is what is holding it back the most, as the good the expansion does is heavily diluted by quest and world design aimed at expanding the total playtime without actually offering anything interesting.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji begins rather well with one of the most unique quests in the entire game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji is an endgame expansion and, as such, can only be accessed after the main story and the personal quests of Naoe, Yasuke and Junjiro have been completed. There's a story justification for this, as the expansion is centered around the recovery of the last regalia on Awaji Island and a brief war against Kimura Yukari, the daughter of the Templar Kimura Kei whom Yasuke already dealt with. After a short first quest that does an excellent job introducing the current state of Awaji Island in a believable Japanese way, Naoe and Yasuke travel to the island to save Naoe's mother, Tsuyu, recover the regalia, and put an end to yet another Templar in Japan.</p>



<p>Being around 5 hours long, the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji story isn't particularly deep, but it's entertaining enough with some high points at the beginning and the end. The new characters around which the main quest is centered aren't well developed and fall in line with everything seen in the base game. Some are despicable individuals, no matter the angle; others fall more into a grey moral area where they are duty and honor-bound to serve the Templar lady, but none of their motivations are fully explored, making them nothing more than a device to move the story toward its conclusion. To be honest, no character or event in the expansion is bad to the point of being offensive, but they are so unremarkable that I would be surprised if anyone remembered much a few hours after completing the story.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji's story has some highlights but is mostly unremarkable.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In my opinion, unremarkable is also the most apt description of Awaji Island and everything in it. Thanks to the technical improvements introduced in the Anvil Engine, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands as one beautiful open-world game with some standout locations, but the new island is definitely not going to be among them, as there is nothing in it that truly stands apart, as the entire new map, which is also rather small, seems to be some sort of rearranging of visual elements lifted from the base game. The actual design of the map also leaves something to be desired, as it is very predictable and features some areas in different parts that are almost identical. Also, at launch, Awaji Island is not as polished as the base game was, as I have encountered a good number of visual glitches that were hard to miss, including a glitch in the wind system which made leaves on the ground scatter as if there was an explosion beneath them. Nothing truly gamebreaking, but their frequency was definitely immersion breaking.</p>



<p>With an unremarkable story and map, it should be no surprise that Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji disappoints even in terms of content. This is where it's clear how going for quality over quantity may have helped a lot, as the best additions to the experience are really well done, such as the new Bo weapon for Naoe. This versatile weapon comes with tons of pretty useful skills, including one that can heal her with timed button presses, and a stance system that makes Naoe much better at fighting enemies head-on with options to push back, stagger, and knock down enemies. Yasuke, on the other hand, doesn't get any new weapon, but new skills for all of his weapon types that work quite well against a group of enemies, making them a welcome addition. Though not a gameplay addition, the entire questline focused on Nowaki, one of the central figures in the Sanzoku Ippa faction that dominates the island, is the highlight of the expansion, ending with a stealth-focused boss battle that reminded me of the boss fight against The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Bo weapon for Naoe is one of the best additions in Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the above are the only highlights of the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji expansion. The rest of the content is recycled from the base game, with a mix of stealth and combat-focused quests that do nothing different. In some instances, this recycled content is even worse than the base game's content due to design decisions clearly motivated by the intent to extend playtime. Many quests, for example, begin at one of the ends of the island and continue to the opposite end. Without a fast travel point, the journey can take a few minutes which are as unremarkable as most of the time in the expansion, as the island's design is nothing to write home about, as already mentioned, the side activities are either the same seen in the base game, like drawing Sumi-e for Junjiro and the Kuji-kiri meditation points or strongholds and camps to clear, or slightly altered versions that don't add much. The decision to make the Sanzoku Ippa a very aggressive faction that is constantly on the hunt for Naoe and Yasuke is a nice touch that adds a bit of tension to potentially dull traversal, but at times, they are so aggressive that constantly getting sniped by a rifleman hidden in a bush, or falling into traps, becomes old fast, considering it is still very easy to get away from the assaulters with no consequences. The hunt for Tomeji's most trusted companions is another great example of the content bloat in the expansion. Although it is optional, going after these men is somewhat required to make the fight against Kimura Yukari's strongest warrior more manageable, but doing so doesn't add much to the experience, as, with some exceptions, they are regular enemies with more health and armor. When you spend more time looking for these targets rather than actually fighting them, it's clear how there's an issue.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji isn't a bad expansion, and those who loved the base game will probably find plenty to like in it if they are not tired of the formula. The main issue is that almost everything, from story and characters to map design, quest design, and optional content, is unremarkable and doesn't add anything new to the experience, with the exception of the new Bo weapon and the Nowaki questline, which are great, high-quality additions that definitely deserved better to shine even more.</p>

				<p>With average quest design, a lack of polish, and a forgettable story, Assassin’s Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji shows how the series’ quantity-over-quality approach is continuing to fail. While the Bo weapon for Naoe and the excellent Nowaki questline stand out, they’re drowned by questionable design choices that undermine the experience, making the expansion worthwhile only for the most die-hard fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Only a few months after the lackluster ending of<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c9d86c47-b86e-43a2-bfe0-a023f6d37eee" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em> Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, it's time for us to return to Japan again for the<em> Claws of Awaji DLC</em> with a continuation of Naoe and Yasuke's story. With the promises of a new island, a new story, and a new weapon, was it worth it to hop back into <em>Shadows </em>for one more adventure?</p>

<p>The story of the <em>Claws of Awaji</em> opens with a mysterious message from Hattori Hanzo about a puppetmaster telling the story of an assassin that travelled to the island of Awaji with a hidden blade on her arm. Still on the hunt for her mother, Naoe begins her investigation of the island to try to confirm whether this mysterious assassin is indeed Tsuyu.</p>

<p>I was a big fan of the beginning of <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. A brief amount of time spent on the mainland with an emotional setup for Naoe and a good reason for you to visit the island. That, coupled with the linear storytelling, made it clear that there was more focus and direction.</p>

<p>These first few missions are a focused experience with a mix of missions you can play as Naoe or Yasuke, or character-specific missions where you hop between the two. This also lent to the strength of this DLC. I appreciated the linear nature of the story and how there were valid reasons for why I might approach a mission with Yasuke instead of Naoe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after about an hour of this more refined experience, the DLC took a page from the base game. After identifying your primary target, you then identify their primary lieutenants and characters who support the lieutenants. From there, you're dropped into the open world, working on your hit list from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>All of that sense of direction, narrative, and progression flew out the window as I was just checking off boxes on my to-do list. Each major milestone, I'd look forward to some big enhancement of the plot, only to be met with additional newly revealed subordinates that were a horse ride and a quick assassination away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-horse-riding.jpg?itok=QAsYLVTM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-horse-riding.jpg?itok=_MDRObNa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of missions at different ends of the island justify the square footage of Awaji</figcaption></figure><p>The openness of the world and options to tackle these objectives in whatever order you want seems to have a direct negative effect on how engaging the story can be. There can be no references or callbacks to defeating a different powerful enemy, because there's no way to know if the player has experienced that yet. The alternative would be planning for every permutation, but the amount of additional work that would be required for that just wouldn't make sense.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the full game that this DLC also carries forward with is a lack of a worthwhile resolution. Much like how the base game just… ends, this DLC does the same. I don't want to spoil the plot, but the resolution felt more like a reminder that there was more to do in the open world rather than reaching the conclusion of a major milestone in a story.</p>

<h2>A Boss Battle Head And Shoulders Above The Rest</h2>

<p>The standout setpiece from this DLC is the boss fight against an antagonistic shinobi. Set in a mysterious arena with trapped statues meant to look like your foe, you complete this boss battle by hunting after the sounds of your opponent, creeping up on them, and chipping away at their health.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-traps.jpg?itok=73icJn1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-traps.jpg?itok=CuaBEnXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mazes of traps were the highlight of the Claws of Awaji experience</figcaption></figure><p>The arena is filled with grass and water to hide in, but also traps and misleading statues that try to lure you into a trap and deal damage or poison. As a player you're pushed to not rely on stats or what the best weapon in your arsenal is, but instead the stereo audio, keeping an eye out for traps, and watching for your target.</p>

<p>This was an incredible boss battle from start to finish and really showed off the 'Assassin' aspect of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>.</p>

<h2>A New Weapon For Technical Fighting</h2>

<p>In addition to the new adventure, the <em>Claws of Awaji DLC</em> also introduces a new weapon for Naoe. A core aspect of the combat in <em>Shadows</em> is down to not just attacking your opponents, but also reading their movements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Bo weapon takes this a step further by providing you with a weapon where you can attack in a basic combo with light hits, but also very selectively use heavy attacks to push enemies back, attack them high to stun them, or drop low to take them out at their feet.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-narrative-depth.jpg?itok=ToAaIgpW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-narrative-depth.jpg?itok=yhAPub75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This new weapon feels like a next step for someone who's trying to push their technical play further. There's a lot more to think about in terms of movement and strategy, but it does mean that when you do successfully read your opponent and pull off a technical play it can be very satisfying.</p>



<p>I think the best way that I can summarize my experience with <em>Claws of Awaji</em> is that it is a very faithful continuation of the base game. That means that the portions of the game when it's the strongest, like when the narrative can be focused or leaning into stealth, really shine.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the vast open world and "complete it in whatever order you want" mission style weakens the overall narrative, which is really what a lot of people come to an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game for. A story that should have narratively wrapped up two of the largest plot threads from the original game with a bang, just ended up fizzling out…</p>

<p>If you were a fan of<em> Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> then you'll likely enjoy the ~8-hour experience that is <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. Otherwise,&nbsp;you'll likely want to let this DLC pass you by.</p>

              <p>The Mac Mini is an interesting little product. You get a full Mac computer but for significantly less than a MacBook or the iMac. So long as you got a screen to connect it to, you’re good to go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">The 2024 Mac Mini powered by the M4 chip normally goes for $599, but right now Amazon has the miniature desktop Mac for $100 off.</a> That 17% discount brings the price down to just $499.</p>
<p>That’s the starting price. The model down to $499 during this limited time deal comes with 16GB of RAM and an 256GB SSD. For $690, you can double your storage to 512GB.&nbsp; For $904, you can get the model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny But Mighty</h2>
<p>Apple has redesigned the Mac Mini with this 2024 iteration. The footprint is less than half the size of the previous design, measuring in at five by five by two inches. It fits comfortably on any desktop, taking up hardly any space at all. It’s carbon footprint is even smaller. Thanks to the ultracompact design, the Mac Mini is Apple’s first carbon neutral Mac.</p>
<p>A handful of connection options are conveniently found along the front and back of the Mac Mini. You get three thunderbolt ports, two front-facing USB-C ports, an HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and the headphone jack. That one may no longer be on our iPhones, but lives on at our desks.</p>



<p>MacOS can run all your favorite apps or whatever ones you need to get work done. You get full support for Microsoft 365 as well as the Adobe Creative Cloud software suite such as Photoshop and Premiere. With the M4 chipset, you can expect snappy and fluid performance in any of these applications. Apple’s MacOS employs a slew of privacy protections to keep your data from being accessed by anyone but you.</p>
<p>If you have an iPhone or other Apple products, you can get them all to work seamlessly together. View and control what’s on your iPhone from your Mac, or vice versa, with Mirroring. You can copy something from your iPhone and paste it on your Mac. Access you messages or answer FaceTime calls from either device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">For a limited time, you can save anywhere from $95 to $110 on the 2024 model of the Mac Mini powered by the M4 chipset.</a> Get it for as low as $499 over at Amazon. This price reflects the 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD model without AppleCare+ included.</p>

And thanks to an ongoing Steam sale, you can grab all of the mainline games for under $45.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35801496/sale/preautumn">The <em>Tomb Raider</em> Pre-Autumn Sale started on September 15</a> and goes for the next two weeks. The deal features discounts on most of the franchise that is currently available on Steam. Have you been wanting to play the excellent puzzle game <em>Lara Croft GO</em>? Well, stop waiting and go play it because it’s only $1.50 right now on Steam. Maybe you’ve been meaning to check out that <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-the-kotaku-review-5986619">2013 reboot</a> everyone was buzzing about over a decade ago? I’m not sure why you waited so long, but good news: It’s only $2.25 during the sale.</p> <p>Here’s everything on sale for the next two weeks:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Tomb Raider </em>(2013)</strong> – $2.25 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>Rise of the Tomb Raider </em></strong>– $3 ($30)</li> <li><em><strong>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$8 ($40)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider: Definitive Survivor Trilogy</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$12 ($91)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider I-II-III: Remastered</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$12 ($30)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider IV-V-VI: Remastered</strong> –&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>$15 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Tomb Raider I-VI: Remastered </em>Bundle</strong> – $25 ($55)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: Legend</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$1 ($7)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: Anniversary</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$1 ($9)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider: Underworld</strong> –</em>$1 ($9)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</strong> –&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>$1.50 ($10)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$3 ($20)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft GO</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$1.50 ($10)</li> </ul> <p>And if you’re wondering: Here’s how you get all 12 of the mainline games for less than $50. Buy the <em>Definitive Survivor Trilogy</em> bundle, the <em>Remastered</em> bundle, and<em> Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld.&nbsp;</em>If you do it like that, you’ll only pay (not accounting for local taxes) about $42. Not bad! And if you toss the two co-op spin-offs and <em>GO</em> into your cart, you’ll likely be at or just over $50, which is a solid deal for 15 <em>Tomb Raider</em> games, most of which are good to great. Oh, and most of these games play well on a Steam Deck, though be prepared for some fiddlin’ with some of the older titles.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/oneodio-focus-a6-wireless-headphones-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oneodio-focus-a6-wireless-headphones-review.1298982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As we hurtle steadily towards the festive season, manufacturers of all and sundry are set on filling the space underneath your spruce with as many of their own products as humanly possible. OneOdio, a Chinese audio specialist, are also set on getting you there on a budget, with their latest, the Focus A6, coming in at a thoroughly reasonable £55. Does this make it a budget king in 2025? It certainly comes pretty close.</p>
<p>The OneOdio Focus A6 sure is a pair of wireless headphones. That’s not a knock, but this is a thoroughly understated and relatively unassuming pair of cans. Decked out all in Midnight Black – it’s also available in the light Ivory Blush – you could almost be forgiven for thinking they’re an older pair of Sony’s iconic XM3/MX4 headphones, were it not for the small OneOdio logo on each earpiece and gold ring circling it.</p>



<p>After the larger, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/oneodio-a5-headphone-review/">XM5-aping A5</a>, this is a welcome step back. I like their looks, opting for subtle rather than overpowering, but that does make them feel slightly unremarkable. I guess that’s a plus or negative depending on how much of an extrovert you are, and whether you view headphones as a fashion accessory.</p>
<p>The Focus A6 feel quite plasticky. There are areas here where that plastic feels thin and cheap, particularly at each end of the metal headband, where it joins to the earpiece joints. If you’re sensitive to a spot of plastic ick, then this is the worst part of the A6, but other areas such as the metal headband and its suitably plush memory foam padding help to balance things out. I’ve worn them for hours at a time and I don’t feel like I need to take them off; the leatherette earpads in particular are really soft, and that light plastic does help to keep the weight down to a head-pleasing 240g.</p>

<p>It doesn’t necessarily make the A6 feel weak either. I was able to twist and pull at the headband without wrecking it, and the A6 has been robust enough to be folded up and chucked into my backpack with a lunchbox bouncing along beside it. The fact they fold up is also a huge bonus when everyone else seems to have forgotten that this is a really handy thing for headphones to do.</p>

<p>Some people will rejoice at the news that the Focus A6 has physical controls – seated in easy reach on the right earpiece – and they do exactly what you need them to do. The cheap plastics carry through here, but with a toggle for ANC, Power and a volume rocker that doubles up for playback control, you can definitely live with it.</p>
<p>Despite the slightly underwhelming aesthetics, the Focus A6 is packing a host of features that are worth talking about. Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation nestles up to wired and wireless Hi-Res certification, with support for the LDAC codec ensuring that your experience sounds as true to the original recording as possible, though not on Apple products.</p>
<p>You’ve got to do a bit of work to get there though. The standard sound profile of the Focus A6 is thoroughly lifeless, and it’s lucky that the OneOdio app is on hand to bring everything up to scratch. There’s only three preset EQs, and of these, only the Pop setting comes close to being useful. Fortunately, there’s space for three custom EQ presets, and I found that dialling things in with a deep scoop in the mid-range brought out the best of the A6, at least for the rock and metal genres I tend to listen to.</p>

<p>Embarking on a Nine Inch Nails marathon thanks to the brand-new Tron Ares soundtrack, my first port of call was the album’s first single, As Alive As You Need Me To Be. The A6 did a great job here, delivering the dark synth tones and thumping beats with a surprising level of clarity. It’s warmer rather than detailed, and it feels like the A6 has been designed as a real crowd-pleaser with its approachable audio abilities and welcoming price point. If you’re looking for absolute detail, you might want to look elsewhere, but when it’s handed a lossless piece of audio, the Focus A6’s 40mm drivers sound good. You might find they sound even better when you think about how little they cost, and they’re a huge step up after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/oneodio-a5-headphone-review/">their bass-heavy predecessor</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the budget pricing, there’s the welcome inclusion of Hybrid ANC. This now-essential inclusion helps to reduce external noises, and lets you focus on whatever you’re listening to, rather than the big bad real world. It’s clearly nowhere near the level of Sony or Bose over-ear masterpieces, but the A6 costs a quarter of the price, and their performance far exceeds that. There is an audible low-level hiss when activated and without any audio playing, but that disappears in normal use. The corresponding Transparency mode isn’t as clear as the best efforts out there, but once again, it’ll serve you well when you’re ordering a coffee or paying at the checkout.</p>
<p>There’s also a very healthy 40 hours of battery life here with the ANC enabled, and a whopping 75 hours with it turned off, which trounces both Sony’s XM5 and newer XM6, and leaves the Bose QuietComfort Ultra in the dust. They might both have more effective ANC, but it clearly comes at a cost to battery life. If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t want to think about charging their gear too often, this is the headset for you.</p>

<p>There are a couple of bonus features to enhance your audio consumption with the Focus A6, but they come with a pair of caveats. The first is the low-latency Game Mode, which is perfect for competitive mobile gaming, but can only operate alongside the less detailed AAC codec, and this forces you to reconnect the headphones when you switch. Alongside that, there’s a Cinema Mode, which slightly ups the immersion when watching big blockbusters, but which is fiddly to activate. If there was a way to activate either modes on the headset, I could see them being useful, but it’s unlikely I’ll hop into the app to toggle them on, especially when the headset does a decent enough job on its own.</p>
<p>The OneOdio app also takes care of the things you’d hope for, including updating your headset to the newest firmware. I was impressed by how quickly and easily this was done, especially when other, far bigger firms somehow struggle to reliably update their own headsets without losing connection. From here you can dig into all the settings, and there are two additional ANC modes, with wind reduction options for both ANC and transparency. It’s nice to have them, and they do help to drop interference from the wind to a small extent, but once again, it’s an additional setting in the app to have to reach for, and largely, you’ll be happy with the standard ANC settings.</p>
<p>The sub-£100 category has become so competitive in the last couple of years, and the OneOdio A6 has brought the fight to its competitors. It’s on a par with the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/07/final-ux2000-headset-review/">Final UX2000</a>, though the Final pair may just edge it on the comfort front. There’s also the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/09/monoprice-bt-600anc-headset-review/">Monoprice BT600-ANC</a> to consider, which has the benefit of coming with its own hard case as well.</p>
<p><em>There’s currently a nice little discount available on the <a href="https://bit.ly/4em8cFG">official site</a> with the following discount code ONESPPRMR (15% OFF), making the A6 even better value. Valid from July 7 to September 30.</em></p>

The studio has famously attempted to link its long-running sci-fi MMORPG EVE Online to a shooter game with the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-working-on-new-ue4-powered-fps-for-pc-as-dust-514-is-discontinued/">Dust 514</a> and its spiritual successors that never saw the light of release, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Nova</a>. Despite the failures, CCP Games continued to find the right way to achieve that vision, and now they're one step closer with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-londons-game-is-a-genre-defining-hugely-ambitious-eve-shooter-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London studio's game</a>.</p>



<p>Starting with Operation Nemesis, Warclones on the ground (in EVE Vanguard) and Capsuleers in the cosmos (in EVE Online) will now influence the same conflict. Vanguard squads uncover intel that enables Capsuleers to reveal and raid Upwell convoys in space. This persistent economic and military connection unites boots-on-the-ground combat with interstellar warfare, giving players the power to shape the fate of New Eden together.</p>



<p>Snorri Árnason, Executive Producer at CCP Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Operation Nemesis marks a major milestone for EVE Vanguard. This is the first real taste of our much grander vision: We’re delivering a persistent, online sandbox shooter where your actions resonate across a living, player-driven universe. With the foundations in place, we’re now fusing new systems into the framework as we set the stage for Early Access. EVE Vanguard is growing with every milestone, and players are starting to see the boundless potential of the ultimate sci-fi experience we’re building: one universe, one war, fought across space and planets.</em></p>



<p>Scott Davis, Game Director for EVE Vanguard, added:</p>



<p><em>The feeling at CCP’s London studio is that we’re building the game of our dreams. EVE Vanguard represents our vision for a bold new FPS that combines the intensity of brutal combat with the depth and persistence usually reserved for MMOs. Operation Nemesis is the most significant step forward so far, giving fireteams and solo operators the chance to battle-test and influence the game ahead of next year’s Early Access launch. So grab your friends, squad up, and help us build it together. We’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what’s to come.</em></p>
