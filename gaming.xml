            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last year’s newest hardware from Nintendo has proven to be a massive hit. The Switch 2 has already sold 17.37 million units, in an impressively short space of time, making it the fastest-selling console ever. That’s a huge victory for the Japanese company, particularly when there was a point – I’m sorry, my beloved Wii U – where it looked like Nintendo could be heading out of the hardware business altogether.</p>
<p>Still, Nintendo isn’t known for resting on its laurels. The Switch 2’s predecessor went through a number of revisions, and while some of them were purely under the hood, both the Nintendo Switch OLED and the Switch Lite made major changes to the hardware. It seems unsurprising then, that rumours are already swirling about a Switch 2 revision of its own, with the three letter code “OSM” sparking this mystery.</p>

<p>Could the first revision we might be seeing of the Switch 2 will be the Switch 2 Lite. Those nosy kids on the internet have dug around in Nintendo’s back pocket – well, the User Account Portal – and found what appears to be mention of an all-new hardware tag, that doesn’t correspond to any of the current Switch consoles out there.</p>
<p>This OSM model uses the same type of product identifiers as both the original Switch and the Switch 2. The original Switch model numbers all began with “HAC”, the Lite used “HDH”, and the OLED used “HEG”, while the Switch 2 itself is thought to be “BEE”. Now, OSM doesn’t really fit into either generation, and it’s never been an acronym, but that hasn’t stopped people suggesting it might stand for Ounce Small Model or relate to an OLED revision. Maybe it’s an Oversized Switch Museum to make Welcome Tour a reality?</p>


<p>So, we’ve got a mystery, and we love a good mystery don’t we? Especially if it means we might be seeing a new version of the Switch 2, but you do really have to ask, do we need a new version of the Switch 2 already? The initial hardware is less than a year old, and new hardware’s primary function is to reinvigorate sales or find a new market for a product where sales are slowing. That’s definitely not the case for the Switch 2. The Switch Lite arrived 30 months after the first Switch came out, and the Switch OLED even later, so to see a Switch 2 Lite in 2026 would be very premature.</p>
<p>Assuming that a Lite version of the Switch 2 arrived, we can probably predict various things about it. The first is that it will be smaller and lighter than the Switch 2. The Switch Lite was some 30 percent lighter than the original Switch, weighing in at 275g compared to the Switch’s 398g. The Switch 2 weighs a hefty 534g, so if Nintendo were looking to make a similar reduction, a Switch 2 Lite could weigh in around 374g. Despite undercutting the original Switch, that’s still a long way away from the dinky Switch Lite, so perhaps they’d take things even further.</p>
<p>The most likely barrier to that will be cooling. The Switch 2’s innards are considerably more powerful than the original Switch, and so the cooling also got an upgrade for the new generation. The Switch Lite only arrived when Nintendo was able to shrink the console’s chipset and reduce its power consumption (which also led to a better battery life version of the regular model). We would likely need to see Nintendo make the same move for the Switch 2 to avoid struggling with cooling and thermal throttling.</p>
<p>One of the reasons the Switch Lite was such a hit, though, was because it was so much easier for children to hold. The smaller form factor has smaller sticks and buttons, perfect for younger hands, and without the detachable Joy Con, it was a simpler, more straightforward device, never mind easier to carry around. If Nintendo couldn’t make it that small because of hardware issues, is there really any point?</p>

<p>Of course, there could be another option for the mystery hardware tag: a revised version of the original Nintendo Switch. The Switch has been an incredible success – with over 155 million sold, it’s just scooted past the Nintendo DS into second place behind the PlayStation 2 – and Nintendo certainly still see value in supporting a console with a huge library and a monstrous install base, particularly when it can work as a gateway console before buying the newer Switch 2. At a time where consoles have been getting more expensive instead of less, and with the skyrocketing RAM prices a possible concern for the Switch 2, a cheaper version of the Switch would be the perfect way to keep Nintendo consoles arriving in more people’s homes.</p>
<p>We saw Nintendo do this with the Wii Mini, a stripped-back, cheap version of the Wii hardware that appeared six years into the console’s lifespan. We’re nearly at 9 years for the original Switch, but it still remains relevant, with new games continuing to release for the plucky hybrid. Consoles are sticking around for much longer than in previous hardware generations, and though the Switch 2 will be Nintendo’s poster child for years to come, there’s money to made with the older console, particularly when its older components shouldn’t be as affected by the AI server farm craze.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, something is intriguing about the OSM model tag, but we’ll just have to wait and see exactly what it is. In the meantime, we’ll continue to love the Switch and Switch 2 we already have.</p>

            <p>After being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-accused-of-using-ai-generated-art-to-promote-sale-as-job-listing-indicates-theyre-keen-to-adopt-ai-assisted-development-tools">accused last week</a> of using AI-generated artwork to promote their store's new year sale, retro game sellers GOG have reportedly addressed the issue in a private Discord server for paying supporters. According to this fresh response from a GOG staffer, the banner was made "with the help of Al tools" and was "mistakenly allowed" to be pushed live on the storefront.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-ai-art-banner-ad-confirms-discord-message-small-team-slop-2000665056">Kotaku</a> report having been sent a screenshot of this response posted in a message to GOG's official Patron Discord server by an employee with the handle Arthur Slay. Beginning with Slay making clear that they're addressing the New Year Sale banner, their message as shared by Kotaku continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>First of all, regarding the quality of the asset: This banner was a work-in-progress asset that we mistakenly allowed to be displayed on the storefront. This shouldn’t have happened. We failed on at least two levels: Quality-control of the asset that landed on the front page, and then reacting quickly enough when we noticed the error. Second, I want to confirm that this WIP asset was indeed made with the help of Al tools. We hear your disappointment with the use of this technology, and see that it’s a sensitive topic for many of you.</blockquote>
<p>Slay then reportedly went on to discuss GOG's general approach to the use of AI, emphasising that the game sellers "don’t have the infinite resources of the industry giants" and that they "experiment with tools that can allow us to do more with the limited hands we have" as part of their preservation efforts. "We’ve been testing different technologies since our beginnings," the staffer added. "Some experiments are successful, and some (like this banner) are not. Exploring various tech gives us the reach of a much larger team, so we never have to settle for doing less."</p><p>Approached for comment on the sale banner last week, GOG told RPS they were unable to "comment publicly on our internal processes or tools". I've reached out to the company for a second time in light of this Discord message.</p>
<p>The Polish storefront - noted for revamping and selling a bunch of classic games - changed ownership in late 2025, with Witcher developers CD Projekt opting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">sell to original GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński</a> in a deal worth about £18.6 million. So far, Kiciński's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">suggested the plan for the store going forwards</a> is to remain focused on preservation and DRM-less games.</p>

Although Rutschlé doesn't believe Ubisoft's struggles are solely the fault of Guillemot, he explained that as CEO he is ultimately responsible.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's his company, at the end of the day," says Rutschlé. "But everyone around him are just yes men. That was also the issue during the sexual [harassment] scandal in 2020."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked directly whether he would like to see a change in leadership at the very top, Rutschlé had a simple answer: "Sure. I expect nothing from this guy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a sentiment shared by Mataoui, who questioned Guillemot's decision to name his son, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-announces-leadership-for-tencent-backed-subsidiary">Charlie Guillemot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as co-CEO of a new subsidiary that will house some of the company's biggest franchises. He said that, apart from being an instance of nepotism, Guillemot's habit of promoting those closest to him is negatively impacting Ubisoft's ability to craft hit video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you just put your white male friends in [those jobs], then you don't promote any diversity or get any new opinions or ideas," continued Mataoui. "We are in a creative job. We need new ideas to come in to [help us] make great new games. But we don't have that. We don't have this mindset for creativity."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ashes-of-creation-developer-intrepid-studios-shuts-down" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Ashes of Creation developer Intrepid Studios shuts down</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mataoui said it feels as if the current cohort of Ubisoft executives "don't understand their social responsibility to employees" and suggested that workers themselves should be able to elect people to oversee the company. "I'd rather have a manger who I consent to give my workforce, than a manager who I cannot trust. The situation right now is that we don't trust these people," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, both Mataoui and Rutschlé said the management team at Ubisoft failed to actively rebuild bridges with employees after the company was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-ubisoft-paradox-how-the-publisher-enabled-a-culture-of-abuse-and-control">accused of enabling a culture of fear and control in 2020</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by allegedly cultivating a workplace where abusers could thrive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rutschlé explained those reports, coupled with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nft-peddler-ubisoft-complains-that-players-simply-don-t-get-the-pitch">company's decision to enter the divisive NFT market</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shortly after, only served to eradicate any remaining goodwill between workers and management.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, he said it feels as if there is no going back. "I think Guillemot should move away at this point," said Rutschlé. "I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on.

"The whole return-to-office policy is very hard to take," said Rutschlé, who claimed Ubisoft must be aware it will cost some employees—such as those who might have recently purchased homes or who have families—their jobs at the company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that Ubisoft previously struck agreements with some employees that facilitated a level of remote working. Those, he suggested, have now been torched without reason. "We asked them for documentation or analysis that showed a link between production or creativity with the return to the office. They had none," Rutschlé continued. "So it's like 'okay, let's do that then.' As a union representative, I'm like 'what the fuck, man?.'"&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rutschlé suggested the newly-announced restructure and ongoing cost-cutting is simply a way for Ubisoft to "make big announcements that make shareholders happy." Those announcements, however, have sometimes rubbed shareholders the wrong way (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://insider-gaming.com/investors-demand-ubisoft-to-renegotiate-tencent-deal/">thanks Insider Gaming</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) and tanked Ubisoft's valuation on the stock market (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-shares-tumble-after-assassins-creed-creator-unveils-restructuring-2026-01-22/">via Reuters</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mataoui claimed the only way Ubisoft can now course-correct is to remove the entire board of directors and recruit "fresh minds" who are willing to lead with integrity and accountability. Rutschlé said it's also vital for Ubisoft workers across the world—especially in locations such as Montreal, which is viewed as an influential studio within the company—to organize in order to secure their own futures and hold management to account.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Join the unions," said Rutschlé, when asked whether he has a message for his colleagues across the globe.

            <p>Barely over a month in, 2026 has been busy, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is easily the strangest game release we've had so far. Following a baffling, nearly marketing-free rollout following its reveal at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a>, it crashed into a wall of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">negative reviews</a>, but developer Wildlight Entertainment was quick to react. Now, the sentiment is more positive following 5v5 matches being tested and locked - but can it survive the poisoned conversation that's sprung up around the game so far?</p>
<p>Ahead of the last weekend, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-update-reduces-crashes-by-90-adds-crouch-toggle-option">first patch</a> addressed some of the most pressing criticisms, with the devs also deciding to experiment with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-has-a-new-5v5-mode-but-its-only-live-this-weekend">limited-time 5v5 mode</a> that could maybe make Highguard's large maps feel less empty outside the attack and defence phases. It turns out that was a good call, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Steam</a> reviews have now climbed up to "Mixed" as players (the hopeful ones, at least) engage with a more frenetic and brutal version of the shooter. Thus, the 5v5 queue is staying.</p>
<p>Of course, the conversation on social media and YouTube is far more negative, with the usual suspects using the latest big attempt at breaking into the live-service space as a punching bag instead of downvoting and moving on. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-we-being-too-hard-on-live-service-games">There's a conversation worth having</a> about the industry reaching peak live-service critical mass years ago, sure, but don't expect grifters to approach <em>any game</em> making waves in good faith.</p>
<p>That said, the reality of the situation is that Highguard is struggling after a confusing launch and due to its objectively under-cooked state. There's a few too many different shooters in that esports-oriented mix, and not all of them work or play well together. The 5v5 mode is promising in that it actually feels good to play and makes you catch a glimpse of what the game <em>could become</em> in the long run. That is, if there's a long run for it. We know <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-roadmap-apex-legends-live-service-plan/">Wildlight worked on a full-year roadmap for Highguard</a>, but can the game really sustain itself for so long?</p><p>The game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#1w">SteamDB profile</a> paints a grim picture, at least on PC, with the concurrent players chart steadily going down since Highguard opened its gates on 26th January. 3,157 players are inside the game at the time of writing, with 8,404 at its 24-hour peak. Positive reviews are up, yes, and even surpassing the negative ones now, but these numbers aren't what you want to see only a week after launch when you're thinking big with another online shooter.</p>

<p>We don't have access to the data on consoles yet, but so far, the crossplay capabilities are ensuring that matchmaking is quick, so there might be a bigger interest there that we can't quantify. In my personal case, I'm now curious about where it could go following the 5v5 update, but <a href="https://www.vg247.com/concord-review">having been burned in the past</a> a few too many times by similar shooters, I'm also staying realistic.</p>

            <p>The Nintendo Switch has surpassed the DS to become the company's best selling console ever.</p>
<p>As shared in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf">Nintendo's latest financial report</a>, which covers the first nine months of FY2026 up until 31st December 2025, the Switch has now sold 155.37m units. To compare, the company's previous best selling console - the Nintendo DS - has clocked up 154.02m units sold as of 31st December 2025.</p>

<p>3.25m Switch units were sold during the nine-month period covered in Nintendo's latest financial report, which began on 1st April 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Switch console is now the second best selling console of all time, only behind that of the PlayStation 2. Back in 2024, Sony confirmed its PS2 console - which first released back in March 2000 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-officially-surpasses-160m-sales-retaining-its-best-selling-console-crown">had shifted 160m units since its millennium launch</a>.</p>

The Switch 2 is Nintendo's fastest-selling dedicated video game platform.</p><p>As for Switch 2 software sales, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has sold 14.03m units, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold 4.25m units, Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition has sold 3.89m units and Kirby Air Riders has sold 1.76m units.</p>

<p>Looking at the coming weeks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-93-most-exciting-games-of-2026">Nintendo is set to release Mario Tennis Fever in February, and then Pokémon Pokopia will be arriving in March</a>.</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever promises 38 characters - the most in the series' history apparently - plus a range of different activities, online options, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-nintendos-latest-direct">an adventure mode starring the Mario babies</a>.</p>

<p>There are only a handful of games to peruse from the Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> conspicuously absent. In fact, Nintendo has not made mention of Retro Studios' latest in any capacity regarding sales data, so it seems likely that it's failed to reach 1 million sales on either the Switch or Switch 2. Combined sales may tell a different story, but it's definitely not a good look for the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cepymoxn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

			<p>Today, <strong>Nintendo</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported its <strong>Q3</strong> financial results</a>, revealing that the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> console has already sold <strong>17.37 million units</strong> as of December 31, 2025. As a reminder, the hybrid console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted in stores on June 5, 2025</a>, and immediately set new sales records.</p>



<p>Last quarter, the game developer, publisher, and console manufacturer announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Switch 2 had reached <strong>10.36 million units</strong></a>. This means that in the last three months, Nintendo added <strong>7.01 million units</strong>. Sure, it was the Holiday quarter, but the figure remains nonetheless impressive. The company's forecast of <strong>19 million units</strong> sold by the end of the current fiscal year (in late March) seems not only achievable but also easy to surpass. At this trajectory, <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 should handily break the 20 million-unit milestone by then</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>original Switch</strong> is also still meaningfully contributing to Nintendo's bottom line. During the past quarter, the 9-year-old console still sold <strong>3.25 million units</strong>, which allowed it to surpass <strong>155 million units</strong> sold and thus officially take the top spot as Nintendo's best-selling console hardware ever, topping the <strong>Nintendo DS</strong>, which stopped at 154 million units. If its successor keeps this pace, though, it may eventually overtake it in a few years.</p>



<p>When it comes to game sales, Nintendo Switch 2 games are also doing well. The launch title <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a></strong> has now sold <strong>14.03 million units</strong>, although that includes bundle sales. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong: Bananza</a></strong> is already at <strong>4.25 million units</strong>, while <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a></strong> has sold <strong>1.76 million units</strong>.</p>



<p>The only slight decrease reported by Nintendo this quarter is in IP (intellectual property) sales, which were down 10.1% year over year due to lower movie-related revenue. However, that will soon be remedied <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the imminent theatrical release of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong>, <span>scheduled for&nbsp;<strong>April 1</strong>&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;</span>counted in Nintendo's next fiscal year. </p>



<p>Even with the lower IP sales, <strong>the company's net sales have increased by nearly 100% compared to last year thanks to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, totaling <strong>$12.25 billion</strong>.

<p>So let's dive in and take a look at the full list, hm?</p>
<h2>Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mario Tennis Fever - 12th February 2026</li>
<li>Pokémon Pokopia - 5th March 2026</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup at Bellabel Park - 26th March 2026</li>
<li>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book - Spring 2026</li>
<li>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave - 2026</li>
<li>Splatoon Raiders - TBD</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nintendo Switch</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> - 19th February 2026</li>

</ul>
<p>Not a bad line-up, overall, but we'd argue that 2026 is definitely lacking that 'killer app' at the moment. Y'know, your 3D Mario, your Zelda... The latter is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, so who knows, we may well see something special in the coming months.</p>

<p>DS has finally been toppled</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9dc3aeeaf2f32"><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9dc3aeeaf2f32/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has updated its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">sales figures for the Switch</a>, and it's official folks, the little hybrid that could is now the company's best-selling console of all time.</p>
<p>We've been keeping a close eye on this since the last financial report back in November 2025, where only 10,000 units separated the Switch and the Nintendo DS. Naturally, it seemed only inevitable that the former would emerge victorious, but it's nice to see Nintendo officially acknowledge it.</p>
<p>So what are the specific figures? Well, the Switch has now sold a total of <strong>155.37 million</strong> units, while the DS was previously sat atop the throne at <strong>154.02 million</strong>. The Switch 2, meanwhile, has gotten off to a roaring start with a total of <strong>17.37 million</strong> units sold since launch in June 2025.</p>
<p>The Switch is still not the best-selling console of all time, though. Sony recently found a bunch of PS2 sales just kinda hiding down the back of the couch, which means the iconic console is now currently sitting at over 160 million units. At this stage, we're not entirely convinced the Switch will manage to reach 160 million, but hey, stranger things have happened!</p>
<p>It's an astonishing feat from the Switch regardless, though. For clarity, here's a look at every Nintendo console for comparison:</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>For the Switch 2, Nintendo has not updated its sales forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, so it's current target is 19 million. At 17.37 with another quarter of the year to go, we reckon it'll have absolutely no trouble meeting its target.</p>

            <guid>1423597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent report published by Newzoo, the full-year game performance metrics for 2025 were revealed. The graphs and numbers told a telling tale about the state of play across both console and PC markets, revealing the biggest movers and shakers, and by contrast, the games that fell out of fortune with players worldwide last year.</p>



<p>Two slides in particular, one addressing the biggest money-makers on console and the other answering the same question on PC, offered a sort of axiomatic revelation. Year after year, console gamers can’t escape their sports games.</p>







<h2 id="h-sports-games-don-t-make-money-on-pc">Sports Games Don’t Make Money on PC</h2>



<p>Newzoo’s newest annual report breaks down the numbers across PC and console for a 12-month spread, uncovering the best-selling games, the titles with the highest revenue, and those with the most sizeable MAU counts.</p>



<p>On the PC front, the top ten games by <strong>revenue</strong> (in six major markets) were:</p>



<ol>
<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule 1</li>



<li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>R.E.P.O.</li>



<li>Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Expedition 33</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>
</ol>



<p>By contrast, the console market seemed laser-focused on <strong>sports games</strong> in 2025:</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Madden NFL 26</li>



<li>MLB The Show 25</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</li>



<li>EA Sports College Football 26</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>
</ol>



<p>Those lists indicate that 50% of the best-selling games on console platforms in 2025 were <strong>all </strong>annual sports releases. These are the relatively safe, simple purchases that players often make out of habit rather than anything else. As the report indicates, this is suggestive of PC players being more ‘experimental’ in their gaming habits.</p>



<p>You get a lot of early access titles launching on PC, for instance. It gives players a more diverse repository to pull from, even if a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/keeping-game-early-access-nine-months-kill-it-data/">those games fall flat</a> because they remain in that state for too long.</p>



<p>The MAU stakes on console are drastically different, though. At the top of the table sits Fortnite, followed by Call of Duty, then GTA 5, Roblox, and Minecraft. You don’t get into a sports title until the sixth spot on the list, and even then, it’s EA Sports FC 25, which is followed swiftly enough by EA Sports FC 26.</p>



<p>Rocket League is arguably a sports title, and that sits in seventh place for console players, but it’s not an annual release.</p>



<p>The PC MAU trend is pretty similar to console. The number-one spot is secured by Counter-Strike 2, but Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite are all in the top five. Call of Duty finds a place in the top ten as well, but the other games are made up mostly of those that are unique to PC, like League of Legends and Dota 2.</p>



<p>In 2024, Newzoo revealed that PC gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-gained-more-players-than-console-in-2024/">gained <strong>more new players</strong></a><strong> </strong>than console platforms, which was an eye-opener. It was also revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/">58% of PC gaming revenue</a> came from <strong>microtransactions</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="692a8a4c594a5"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/692a8a4c594a5/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf">financial data</a> for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, confirming that the Switch 2 has now sold an astonishing <strong>17.37 million units</strong> since launch in June 2025. <em>17.37 million</em><em>!</em></p>
<p>If you remember, Nintendo increased its forecast for Switch 2 sales back in November 2025 from 15 million to 19 million. Honestly, that seemed a tad overly-ambitious to us at the time, but it seems the Switch 2 will have absolutely no trouble smashing through its target by the time the fiscal year is out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Nintendo has also showcased a rather lovely graphic to demonstrate how fast the Switch 2 is selling compared to the Switch. Note that this has the Switch 2 at 15 million units, but specific figures in Nintendo's dedicated unit sales page has it at 17.37 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="30e5a02f32d62"><a title="Sales Chart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30e5a02f32d62/sales-chart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software is also sitting pretty at a total of <strong>37.93 million</strong> units, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> taking the lead at 14.03 units shifted. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> managed a total of 4.25 million, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> performed admirably at 1.76 million. Curiously, Nintendo has opted to make no mention of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Hmm, troubling.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the money is going up, up, and up. Net sales for the nine months of FY26 so far are up by 99.3% at a total of 1,905.8 billion yen, while operating profit is up 21.3% at 300.3 billion yen. There are no new changes to the hardware or software forecast for the remainder of the year, and Nintendo has singled out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> as games to watch out for in February and March.</p>
<p>We'll definitely look forward to those, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros.

<p>If you haven't already seen our own review and score, we gave this reimagined release nine out of ten stars, calling it the "most fun version" of this particular entry yet, and well worth a look if you're a fan of "high-quality, old-school JRPG" action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined still encapsulates much of what makes Dragon Quest VII resonant, but with every possible edge sanded off. It succeeds at streamlining a lengthy adventure at the expense of player discovery and friction. Besides being able to reach the credits more quickly, I find it difficult to declare this version as an improvement on what came before."</p>

<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined delivers a better-paced version of this 26-year-old classic while retaining its signature charm, but it also goes too far with some of its changes, sanding down the experience for newer players at the expense of the challenge and discovery"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined is a beautifully designed turn-based RPG that is much more approachable to new players than the 3DS remake in 2016, but it may leave fans of earlier versions feeling slighted...Even though there aren’t any glaring problems with this remake, it never felt as satisfying to play as the HD-2D games or Dragon Quest 11, so be prepared for a noticeably different experience compared to those RPGs."</p>

In its latest earnings release, Nintendo reports that the Nintendo Switch has, as of December 31, 2025, sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">155.37 million units</a> since its launch in 2017, compared to 154.02 million units for the 2004 Nintendo DS.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/813025/nintendo-switch-2-sales-september-2025-earnings">Nintendo reported</a> that the Switch and DS were neck and neck. We expected the holiday sales period would see the Switch surpass the DS, even with Nintendo announcing that primary development would focus on the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot">Nintendo previously said</a> that it would continue to sell the original Switch “while taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration.”</p><p>Nintendo has to keep selling the Switch if it wants to dethrone Sony’s PlayStation 2 as the best-selling video game console of all time. The PlayStation 2, discontinued in January 2013, sold <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">more than 160 million units</a> over its 13-year lifespan.</p><p>Demand for the Switch 2 accelerated over the holidays, with Nintendo reporting 7.01 million units sold during the quarter covering October through December, compared to 4.54 million units in the previous quarter. In total, the Switch 2 has now sold 17.37 million units since it launched in June 2025, taking less than a year to surpass the Wii U’s 13.7 million lifetime sales.</p><p>The Switch 2 launch has helped Nintendo to drive a 51 percent increase in net profit over the first nine months of FY26, reaching ¥358.86 billion (about $2.31 billion). Net sales almost doubled during the same period, jumping to ¥1.906 trillion (about $12.2 billion) compared to ¥956.2 billion ($6.1 billion) last year. Looking ahead, Nintendo maintains its forecast to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by the end of this financial year.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/872768/nintendo-earnings-switch-best-selling-console-ds]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="40062ef98b2c1"><a title="Magical Craft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40062ef98b2c1/magical-craft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Imagineer</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Imagineer and developer syn Sophia (the team behind Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_2_-_fashion_forward">Style Savvy</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_3_-_styling_star">New Style Boutique</a> series) announced a new Switch dressmaking game called <strong>Magical Craft</strong>. It's already been released in Japan late last year, and now, in an update, an ESRB listing has surfaced.</p>
<p>No local release has been announced just yet, but if this rating is any indication, it seems we could be getting some news soon. The developer is the same Japanese team behind the 2023 Marvelous Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fashion_dreamer">Fashion Dreamer</a>. It also more recently helped Imagineer with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3</a>.</p>
<p>In this title, you gather fabrics, motif patterns and other items to make dresses, with "over 100,000 possible designs". To complete each dress, you'll play through mini-games featuring four kinds of sewing magic, and your villagers can then wear your creations.</p>
<p>Here's an official description about the game's protagonist and story (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dressmaking-adventure-game-magical-craft-neko-to-mahou-no-dress-announced-for-switch">via Gematsu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story unfolds in the tranquil village of Frune. The protagonist, a young girl named Lilia, begins her journey as a dressmaker, using the “sewing magic” she inherited from her grandmother. As she fulfills requests from the villagers and works toward becoming a legendary dressmaker, her everyday life of dressmaking begins."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we hear any updates about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>And it's "no comment" on "why separate SKUs were not possible"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="06fa2bb960801"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/06fa2bb960801/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of the superhero workplace comedy game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> on Switch and Switch 2 hasn't exactly panned out as expected.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, there has been a lot of back-and-forth over the past week about censorship in the Nintendo versions of the game. It resulted in the developer AdHoc Studio sharing multiple comments, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">Nintendo issued a formal statement</a>.</p>
<p>The previous update from the studio said the plan was to "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/people-have-a-right-to-be-pd-dispatch-dev-says-it-intends-to-address-at-least-some-censored-switch-content">address at least some of the censored content</a>" in the Switch and Switch 2 releases going forward. Now, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57271-dispatch-devs-say-uncensored-physical-switch-release-not-possible-can-t-comment-on">GoNintendo</a> has asked about the possibility of a "fully uncensored" physical version of the game on Nintendo platforms, but apparently, this won't be happening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GoNintendo:</strong> Unfortunately the answer isn’t one we hoped for. Our point of contact told us there is <em>“no possibility for a physical version to be released without the adjusted content.”</em> They also went on to say that the discussion isn’t <em>“currently relevant as there are no announcements regarding a physical release at this time.”</em> That is very much true, but you might remember that in our interview with Natalie Herman, Lead Producer on Dispatch, we asked about the potential for a physical release. Herman responded by saying, <em>“Let’s just say we’ve dreamed of Dispatch in a shiny red case. We have a lot of physical media fans on our team.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same site also asked about the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">singular worldwide release discussion</a>" doing the rounds online and reportedly got the following response back from AdHoc's PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“AdHoc is legally unable to provide further comment on why separate SKUs were not possible for different regions.”</em></p>

			<p>As you explore the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Poolside Cave</strong> in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> to help the Roamers complete their trial, you will come across a cryptic riddle in the cave's Underground Level 2 map : <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">“A chest that rests in a wintry bath, Will show us the Almighty's path.”</em></p>



<p>While your instinct in any RPG is to open every chest you see, this room is a minefield. Most of the treasure chests here are either completely empty or, far worse, are actually <strong>Canniboxes</strong> in disguise. These monsters are notorious for their high critical hit rate and their ability to cast <strong>Whack</strong> (the series' dreaded instant-death spell).</p>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">In my first playthrough, I learned the hard way that fighting these early on is a recipe for disaster,&nbsp; especially if you're playing at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, so I highly recommend going straight for the&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"wintry bath"&nbsp;</em>and ignoring the decoys.</span></p>

<h3 id="h-finding-the-wintry-bath-chest"><strong>Finding the "Wintry Bath" Chest</strong></h3>



<p>To solve the puzzle and avoid a confrontation with a Cannibox, you need to head to the <strong>eastern side of the map</strong>. You will find a group of <strong>two chests</strong> sitting near a pool of water.</p>

<p>As soon as you interact with it, you will hear a distinct <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">rumbling noise</strong>. This is the signal that the puzzle has been solved and the path forward has opened.</p>

			<p><strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> introduces a level of flexibility never before seen in the series by offering three distinct difficulty presets: <strong>Easy Going</strong>, <strong>Happy Medium</strong>, and <strong>Tough Going</strong>. These roughly correspond to your traditional <em>Easy</em>, <em>Normal</em>, and <em>Hard</em> modes.</p>



<p>While these presets are a good starting point, the "reimagined" experience allows you to adjust every parameter individually, even during the game (<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Main Menu, Settings, Difficulty Level</strong>). After extensive testing, I have found that the default <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Happy Medium</strong> can still feel a bit too simple for both series veterans and those accustomed to RPG mechanics.</p>



<p>To achieve a playthrough that rewards strategy without becoming a tedious grind, I recommend a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Custom Balanced</strong> setup.</p>

<h2 id="h-recommended-balanced-custom-settings">Recommended "Balanced" Custom Settings</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Difficulty-Settings-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The difficulty settings I have used in my first full playthrough of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Setting</strong></td><td><strong>Selection</strong></td><td><strong>Why it Works</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Damage Dealt</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Avoids making enemies feel like "damage sponges."</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Experience Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Maintains the game's native progression curve.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proficiency Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Keeps Vocation leveling steady and rewarding.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gold Acquired</strong></td><td><strong>More</strong></td><td>Reduces early-game poverty and increases gear options.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Strength</strong></td><td><strong>Strong</strong></td><td><strong>Essential</strong> to keep the Vocation system relevant.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Activity</strong></td><td><strong>Monsters Attack</strong></td><td>Keeps the tension high during field exploration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Restore HP after Battle</strong></td><td><strong>Don't Restore</strong></td><td>Preserves the classic resource-management loop.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-why-these-settings">Why These Settings?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-dealt-normal"><strong>Damage Dealt: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>Reducing the damage your party deals has one unfortunate side effect: it prolongs battles with no tangible benefit to strategy.</p>



<p>I tested the difference between <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Normal</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Less</em> damage against two early-game Vicious enemies: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Hammerhood</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ballymolly Region</strong>) and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Bodkin Archer</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Emberdale Region</strong>). There was zero difference in the strategy required; I simply had to spend more turns using <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Healing Herbs</em> to conserve MP. It wasn't more fun—only more tedious.</p>



<h3 id="h-experience-amp-proficiency-normal"><strong>Experience &amp; Proficiency: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>The game is already quite generous with <strong>EXP</strong> and <strong>Proficiency Points</strong>. During my testing, I never felt the need to grind, as the game's balance is handled differently than traditional <em>Dragon Quest</em> games. Keeping these at <em>Normal</em> ensures you stay at the intended power level for the story without inadvertently out-leveling the content.</p>



<h3 id="h-gold-acquired-more"><strong>Gold Acquired: More</strong></h3>



<p>This comes down to personal preference, but <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are notoriously stingy with gold. While I understand you aren't meant to buy out every shop immediately, having more financial freedom early on makes the game significantly more enjoyable. It allows you to experiment with different gear setups rather than being locked into a single "optimal" purchase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Boss-Fight-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>This difficulty settings made my first playthrough very enjoyable without making the experience overly frustrating</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-monster-strength-strong"><strong>Monster Strength: Strong</strong></h3>



<p>Because <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> is balanced differently than the original PlayStation or 3DS versions, the base game is generally quite easy. Anything lower than <strong>Strong</strong> results in combat encounters becoming a "walk in the park."</p>



<p>If you want to actually engage with the <strong>Vocation System</strong> and avoid steamrolling bosses and Elite enemies, setting Monster Strength to <strong>Strong</strong> is the only way to ensure the game's mechanics actually matter.</p>



<h3 id="h-restore-hp-after-battle-don-t-restore"><strong>Restore HP after Battle: Don't Restore</strong></h3>



<p>Setting this to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Don't Restore</strong> is vital for maintaining the survival aspect that defines the series. When HP is automatically restored, the tension during dungeon exploration completely vanishes, as every individual battle exists in a vacuum.</p>



<p>By keeping this setting <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OFF</strong>, you preserve the classic resource-management loop of the series which forces you to make choices in regards to items and spending MPs to heal your party or save them for other skills.</p>



<h3 id="h-bonus-setting-objective-marker-display-off">Bonus Setting -  Objective Marker Display: Off</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Objective-Marker-Off-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Turn off the Objective Marker Display to preserve the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined great sense of discovery</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The beauty of every <em>Dragon Quest</em> title is the sense of <strong>discovery</strong>. This is even more vital in <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, where the core of the experience is witnessing how the world’s islands have changed between the <em>Past</em> and the <em>Present</em>.</p>



<p>Having the marker constantly active conditions your experience, making it feell like it’s on rails. By turning the marker off (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Main Menu</strong>, then <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">System</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Screen Settings</strong>,) you are encouraged to look around the world map and villages and interact with NPCs, who not only provide the clues you need to progress but also flesh out the world with flavor text and lore. This organic exploration makes the game world feel alive, ultimately making your journey far more enjoyable than simply following an icon on a map.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-results">The Results</h3>



<p>By combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Strong</strong> monsters with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">More</strong> gold, you create a game that is tactically demanding but allows you the resources to meet those challenges. It’s the perfect "Sweet Spot" for your first journey into this beautiful world.</p>

			<p>Although it streamlines many of its most challenging elements to be more welcoming than the PlayStation original, <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> can still be a massive undertaking for newcomers that may have some trouble getting into the game and enjoying it right from the beginning.</p>



<p>To maximize your understanding of the early game, and thus its enjoyment, we have put together a list of beginners' tips that are sure to help you enjoy <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> more, especially if this is your first time putting the fragments of the forgotten past back together again.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere" data-level="2">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</a></li><li><a href="#h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely" data-level="2">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</a></li><li><a href="#h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies" data-level="2">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</a></li><li><a href="#h-thoroughly-explore-the-present-day" data-level="2">Thoroughly Explore the "Present Day"</a></li><li><a href="#h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense" data-level="2">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Mini-Medals-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore the world thoroughly to discover all sorts of secrets</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Although the experience has been tweaked to be more welcoming,&nbsp;<em><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong></em>&nbsp;is still a&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>&nbsp;game through and through, which puts the same emphasis on exploration as it does on turn-based combat.</span> As such, <strong>every time</strong> you reach a new island or discover a new village, make absolutely sure to talk to every NPC, search every closet and drawer, and smash every urn and barrel before you do anything else.</p>



<p>This isn't just to discover more gear and items that can make you save some gold and <strong>Mini Medals</strong> (which can be exchanged for rewards in <strong>Estard Castle</strong>), but this is also a tip to enhance your enjoyment of the story. </p>



<p>The true beauty of this game lies in the small details and the connection between the past and the present of an island, which the main story often glosses over, giving you a much deeper connection to the world you are working so hard to restore.</p>



<h2 id="h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Fight-Wisely-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"Fight Wisely" is a great auto-battle option to improve combat pacing</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> addresses the high random encounter rate of older games by making enemies visible on the field, you will still be fighting many enemies during your adventure. To make random battles snappier and considerably faster, consider using the <strong>"Fight Wisely"</strong> Tactics option for all your characters, which you can assign at the start of every battle by pressing the <strong>Triangle / Y / X</strong> buttons.</p>



<p>This auto-combat option is based on the principle of taking down enemies as efficiently as possible. With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Fight Wisely"</strong> on, characters will also heal when needed using either magic or items, making it a much more reliable option than <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Show No Mercy."</strong> During regular combat encounters, however, make sure to <strong>turn off the When Worked Up, Use Let Loose Immediately option</strong> by pressing Triangle / Y / X in the Tactics menu to avoid needlessly wasting the powerful Let Loose skills.</p>



<p>If you wish to speed up battles further, also consider changing the battle speed to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fast</strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra Fast</strong>. While combat animations are great to look at, over the dozens of hours it takes to complete the game, they will grow old, believe me.</p>



<h2 id="h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Gold-Sparkle-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Focus on Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies if you are not inclined towards exploring the world to still reap some great benefits</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you're a player who's more inclined towards quick story progression, you may want to reduce your exploration endeavors to just hunting down two specific things: <strong>Gold Sparkles</strong> and elite <strong>"Vicious"</strong> enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gold Sparkles:</strong> As opposed to regular sparkles, these found on the world map hide special items and <strong>won't respawn</strong>. Hidden in them are rare items such as <strong>Seeds</strong> that can be used to boost your characters' stats permanently.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elite "Vicious" Enemies:</strong> These can be recognized by their <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">red glow</strong> and the fact that they don't move around. These more powerful variants can be challenging, but they drop <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hearts,</strong> which can be equipped to customize your characters with very useful passive abilities.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-thoroughly-explore-the-present-day">Thoroughly Explore the "Present Day"</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Present-Day-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Exploring the Present Day world carefully is really important in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is a common mistake for players to assume that the "Past" versions of islands are the only places where progress happens. However, you should make it a priority to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">explore everything in the Present Day</strong> as soon as an island has been restored. Many vital <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Fragments</strong> are tucked away in the modern versions of towns and dungeons.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can find <strong>useful gear</strong> and <strong>learn more about an island's history by speaking with NPCs</strong> when you revisit a location. In my first playthrough, I found that if I ever felt stuck or unable to progress at the Shrine of Mystery, the solution was almost always a missed fragment hidden in the most recently restored "Present" island.</p>



<h2 id="h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Shop-Screen-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Always priotize defensive gear to have an easier time throughout the game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When visiting a new shop in any of the game's villages and towns, you might be inclined to spend all your gold on the weapon with the highest attack stat. However, I highly recommend that you <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prioritize purchasing defensive gear first.</strong> In <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, especially at <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, survivability is far more valuable than raw power.</p>



<p>The reason for this is simple: every now and then, you will encounter powerful enemies and bosses that can <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">act twice per turn.</strong> A character with a high-damage sword but weak armor can be wiped out in a single turn before your healer even has a chance to react. By focusing on shields, helmets, and armor first, you ensure your party can weather these difficulty spikes. This strategy is crucial for maintaining the game’s pacing and preventing lost progress.</p>

            <guid>1423498</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While walking the halls of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-tabletop-games-at-pax-unplugged-2025" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged</a> this winter, I was immediately struck by the vibrant colors and interesting products on display from <a href="http://www.hugeminis.com/" rel="nofollow">Huge Miniatures</a>. After chatting a bit with the team, they sent along some products for me to check out and review. And I’m thrilled to say, Huge Minis is even better in practice than it looks on the shelf!</p><p>Huge Miniatures sent along a bevy of basing products and tools for me to check out, and I thought the best way to put them all through their paces was to scratch-build some tester scatter terrain out of cardboard. Follow my process and I’ll walk you through the products I used!</p><h2>Huge Miniatures Basing Fundamentals</h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-product-showcase-2.jpeg?itok=raqBGnOb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1067" height="800">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/huge-miniatures-product-showcase-2.jpeg?itok=O-70r0WG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1067" height="800">
                  

  </picture><p>My first order of business when setting everything up for this review was to create a base upon which to build a bit of scatter terrain. Using some scraps of corrugated cardboard I had nearby and some basic white glue, I created a rough hill with varying levels.&nbsp;</p><p>I always like to force a bit of verticality in my scatter terrain, and this off-centered hill felt like a good way to test how these products cover tight and wide spaces, as well as ridges.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-muddy-base.jpeg?itok=Q0AJ__0_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/huge-miniatures-muddy-base.jpeg?itok=bkJ3Bsg- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>After a quick coat of brown acrylic paint over everything (which I would quickly learn was totally unnecessary!), I got to the business of testing out one of the products I was <em>most</em> curious about, the Huge Miniatures Texture Paste. They sent along both the Mud and Snow variations, so I started with the Mud as a basis.</p><p>Here's where I knew I was truly in for a treat! As soon as I opened up the canister and began to spread it on (using a Huge Miniatures Texture Paste Paint Knife, which they also provided), I was shocked by the texture (the name should have been a giveaway, I guess) - it spread evenly, but had a bit of stiffness and weight to it that allowed it to be molded.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-muddy-base-with-snow.jpeg?itok=YhZFWQJs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/huge-miniatures-muddy-base-with-snow.jpeg?itok=brNRW7rQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>Next up was the Snow Textured Paste, which I applied after the Mud had dried (set up in front of a mini-fan, this took less than an hour). And this was even <em>more</em> satisfying to spread on. Thick, but malleable, with a crisp white finish. The only way I can describe the texture was, to put it plainly, like working with cake icing.</p><p>This is the kind of basing material that'll make you want to use up the whole pot just playing around with it on your bases. Experimenting with this texture paste was so satisfying, and I found myself creating little moments and interplay between the mud and snow on the base.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, the snow drifted up against the hillside, there, the mud bled through a shallow drift. It was environmental storytelling on the smallest scale, all thanks to Huge Miniatures.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-base-with-greenery.jpeg?itok=dN7SKc_L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/huge-miniatures-base-with-greenery.jpeg?itok=3w6uDV9e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>Finally, it was time to try out the other basing materials included with this shipment, consisting of the Huge Miniatures 4-in-1 Tundra scatter foliage, frosty tufts, and snowy pure white weathering powder. Both the tufts and the 4-in-1 scatter were easy to use, and instantly helped flesh out the scene I created on my scatter.&nbsp;</p><p>The weathering powder took a moment to get used to, but once I'd gotten the hang of it, I was dusting those shrubs with the best of 'em! It's an interesting product, super-fine and light, and the idea is to apply it pretty liberally with a dry brush, then hit it was a lacquer or sealant and re-apply. At first, I couldn't see what it was accomplishing, but as it dried I was astounded by the wintry vibes it helped bring to life.</p><p>Now, in the above photo, you may notice some very disgruntled, frost-bitten Rebel Troopers (from <em>Star Wars: Legion</em>), I enlisted their help to see how all these basing products worked on actual model bases.</p><h2>Huge Miniatures Model Basing</h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-models-un-based.jpeg?itok=Q_AHWDN0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>I started with a small handful of <em>Star Wars: Legion</em> models I'd already had painted. Pretty handy to have some snowy dudes to test out this snowy basing paste, huh?&nbsp;</p><p>I've always wanted to be the kind of hobby modeler and miniature gamer who fully bases his minis, but the reality is what you see above - it's actually a miracle that I even slapped some white acrylic paint around the bases of my Hoth Rebel Troopers.</p><p>So now, with the right tools and a reason to get back into it, I was ready to work on these bases of these minis.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-applying-basing-snow.jpeg?itok=dh0Ierv3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/huge-miniatures-applying-basing-snow.jpeg?itok=81-KkhWW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>This is where I felt the utility of the included paint knife. While you can use just about anything to spread this Texture Paste onto something as large as a piece of scatter terrain, I found the narrow point of the paint knife perfect for getting between the legs of these figures.</p><p>After liberally applying snow to the bases of these figures, I wanted to go all out and hit them with the weathering powder as well, to ensure they had the right, snow-bound look to them.</p><picture>

It was so fun to mold the snow around them, with the one model on his knee really being designed to look "dug in" to the snow - an idea I was able to push by piling on the weathering powder on his hat, shoulders, and gun barrel.&nbsp;</p><p>I also used the Mud Texture Paste on some random <em>Legion</em> commander models I had lying around, to see if I could recreate the feeling of soldiers trucking through the mud and muck.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>As you can see from the image above, the Mud Texture Paste is a little bit thinner and grainier than the Snow Texture Paste, by design.&nbsp;</p><p>This allowed me to create a much muckier and more fluid scene on these models' bases, allowing it to behave like and mimic Mud much better than if it had a similar constitution to the Snow paste.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Huge Miniatures Modeling Supplies - Final Thoughts</h2><p>What can I say? I'm completely hooked. I love the idea behind - and execution of - the Texture Paste. It's easy to use, dries to create realistic moments, and retains a strong color after drying. The 4-in-1 Tundra scatter was also a big hit, combining four different types of scatter foliage in one easy to use tub. And while the weathering powder took some getting used to, in the end I was really pleased with the results.&nbsp;</p><p>My only <em>real</em> complaint is that I used cheap corrugated cardboard as my scatter terrain base on this test and review! If I had known how much I was going to enjoy working with these products, and how strong the finished product would end up looking, I would have gone the full mile and custom cut some foam with the ol' hot wire cutter.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking to start creating scatter terrain for your games, or want to level up the bases of your miniatures, I cannot recommend Huge Miniatures highly enough.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Following a special Nintendo Direct broadcast last week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, Nintendo is now celebrating the series on its music app this week with the release of the 3DS soundtrack.</p>
<p>This 3DS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> game was locally released in 2014. The soundtrack contains a <em>whopping</em> <strong>210 tracks</strong>, with a runtime of 3 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Oh Mii oh my! Songs from the Nintendo 3DS game Tomodachi Life are now available on the Nintendo Music app... Featuring tracks such as Afternoon on the Island, Mii Apartments, and more."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka (who was recently credited for music in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>) and former Nintendo composer Asuka Itō, who contributed to multiple other Nintendo projects throughout the 3DS generation.</p>

<p>As usual, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription to listen to the soundtrack on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> mobile app. If you didn't catch last week's Direct about the new Switch game, be sure to check out our previous coverage. This new title launches this April.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest Secret Lair sold the same drop at different prices, drawing anger from the community.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning Wizards of the Coast put a new Magic: The Gathering product up for sale with an unexpected twist. The <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/chaosvault" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Prints Charming” Secret Lair drop</u></a> contains four reprinted cards with pretty excellent new art – but rather than simply telling us how much it costs, it was given five different non-foil store listings and five more for the foil version, each with a different price ranging from $10 all the way up to $50. The product description on all of them is careful to point out the following: “The only difference between listings is the price. Higher-priced listings do not include anything extra.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, by my estimation as someone who has been playing Magic since the 90s and literally wrote <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/magic-the-gathering-reveals-new-secret-lair-drop-series-with-wild-art"><u>the announcement for the very first Secret Lair</u></a>, is pretty lame. Taken graciously, it’s a goofy marketing stunt meant to do something silly and get folk talking about it, but it nevertheless leaves those who arrived too late with a very sour taste in their mouth. A more pessimistic reading would be that WOTC is price testing what people are willing to pay for a Secret Lair drop in broad daylight, shedding even the thinnest veneer that may be hiding the capitalist hunger <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set"><u>a lawsuit recently alleged</u></a> is designed specifically to hide shortfalls in other parts of Hasbro’s business. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - "Prints Charming" Secret Lair Drop</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1qu0vyc/sld_chaos_vault_prints_charming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The reaction</u></a> amongst the Magic community has been muddled. Some were confused. Some very generously assumed the higher price points were to bait automated scalper bots into spending more while real people could snag a more affordable version – an argument that doesn’t exactly hold water when you consider that <em>they could just make them all cheaper </em>if that was the desire. And some were just angry, either because the cheapest versions sold out so fast, or because they similarly see this as bold-faced market research in cardboard form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I actually really love the idea of Wizards of the Coast’s Secret Lair line overall. Directly selling small drops of thematically linked cards with cool and unique art treatments is quite fun, and often comes at little-to-no cost for those who just want to ignore it. Being able to give <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-secret-lair-superdrop-brings-the-last-of-us-god-of-war-and-more-to-magic-the-gathering-in-october"><u>Kratos or Aloy their own cards</u></a> without the production lift a larger product would require is a neat tool in WOTC’s toolbelt. The “Chaos Vault” moniker this latest one was released under intentionally pushes the envelope even further with weird, off-schedule ideas and one-offs that are explicitly meant to experiment. I dig that! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that does not mean Secret Lair is free from criticism. Most pressing here, folk (myself included) were already displeased by WOTC’s 2024 decision to move these drops from a “print to demand” model to one with limited and undisclosed quantities. The former system meant anyone who wanted a certain drop could get it within a specific timeframe, while the latter has historically meant you need to get in line <em>right </em>when a popular drop arrives in order to have a <em>chance </em>at purchasing it – something you can’t do if you, say, have work or school at the same time.</p><p>Regardless of intent, the result is a majority of players feeling like they were the ones left holding the bag.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, given there is already anxiety around the availability of Secret Lairs, one that got almost no pre-promotion offering an early bird discount (alongside the option to pay WOTC <em>more</em> money) is understandably frustrating. It’s the sort of thing that independent creators admittedly do with their products from time to time without drawing any ire, rewarding their most dedicated fans while also providing a way to support them even further for those who want to. But for a multibillion-dollar corporation to do it is not endearing in the same way – it comes across more like profit analysis wearing a sign around its neck that reads “it’s just a prank, bro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much to my dismay, both the lowest <em>and</em> highest priced versions of Prints Charming sold out the quickest, either lending some credence to the “ha ha stupid bots” theory or offering evidence that “speaking with your wallet” is and will always be a doomed suggestion. The standard Secret Lair pricing of $30 for non-foil and $40 for foil lasted much longer than the others, so it seems likely the “stock” for those versions was intentionally the largest of all the options. But even if that does make this one big stunt, or even a cute way to subsidize a few discounted drops through folk who are willing to spend a little more, the ultimate result is still that a majority of players feel like they are the ones left holding the proverbial bag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know, maybe I am yelling at the clouds. The card-selling company is experimenting with how much money it can sell its cards for. This should not be a shock, nor am I surprised to see Prints Charming sell out within hours (the art is really excellent, even if its total reprint value of around $5 is not). But the quiet part is being said louder than usual here. The teacher has handed us a test, and I fear what the results will be. The theme of this drop is cards that speed up your green resource production, and if that’s not as on the nose as naming your giant evil space station the Death Star, I don’t know what is.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Associate Reviews Director and local MTG Cube obssessive.

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard’s 5v5 Raid Mode Has Been Added Permanently]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/</link>
            <guid>1423417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Highguard was released last week, one of the biggest points of contention concerned the game’s player structure. Each ‘raid’ in the game could accommodate just six players, three on each team. It made the game feel empty and promoted awkward pacing, and it was mere days before Wildlight, the game’s developer, introduced a 5v5 mode.</p>



<p>It was supposed to be a temporary thing to test the waters, but Wildlight has just confirmed that 5v5 is ‘here to stay’ after a successful trial period.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-5v5-do-anything-to-save-highguard">Will 5v5 Do Anything to Save Highguard?</h2>



<p>Highguard’s player count continues to drop, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-update-target-games-biggest-gripe/">the sentiments</a> surrounding the game are in a critical state. Any viewership has been almost eradicated, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">the year-long roadmap</a> has done little to instill a sense of confidence in those who would call themselves fans.</p>



<p>Last week, Highguard launched after several weeks of radio silence following the game’s grand reveal at The Game Awards. It was an unveiling marred by negativity, and the game’s full release did nothing to abate the disappointment of gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>When it was discovered that this ambitious first-person shooter would accommodate just six players per match, prospective fans found themselves questioning the depth of their matches.</p>



<p>Then, along came Wildlight Entertainment, with an idea to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-adds-5v5-raid-playable-now/">trial a 5v5 mode</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Wildlight confirmed the trial was a success:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay!</p>



<p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments under the post, the game’s fans put a positive spin on the change, suggesting it would cater to the more casual players and attract a wider audience. That hasn’t been reflected in the game’s player count, though.</p>
