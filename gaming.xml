              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-no-offline-mode-always-online-2025-1851777885">EA’s live-service reboot of <em>Skate</em>,</a> which launched back in September, is continuing to expand and improve. The skateboarding game’s second season is out now, and fans mostly appreciate the new content and changes. But a lot of players aren’t happy about their in-game characters suddenly looking sick and tired after season two went live, with some jokingly referring to them as drug addicts or stoners.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-launch-date-september-xbox-ps5-pc-trailer-2000620375"><em>Skate</em> season two went live on all platforms.</a> The update adds cosmetic items, fresh areas to skate, a new trick (the Impossible), and a host of quality-of-life tweaks and visual changes. That’s all good and nice, and overall, fans are happy about the update, even if there are some odd lag issues at the moment. But many players were surprised to find their characters looking different, a bit more tired perhaps, when logging on Tuesday to play <em>Skate</em>. As part of EA and developer Full Circle’s commitment to improving <em>Skate’s</em> visuals, a lot of characters now have dark bags under their eyes and darker complexions.</p>

 <p>“Why the faces look so tired and weird?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pcibc1/why_the_faces_looks_so_tired_and_weird/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">asked one Redditor</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pciob3/season_2_comparison/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Skate</em> subreddit.</a> Someone else joked that the new update had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pchvpk/update_ghould_my_character/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">“Ghoul’d” their character.</a> On Twitter, some replies to EA’s tweet announcing the new <em>Skate</em> update included more screenshots of characters that now look a lot more tired than before. One user shouted at EA: “Look what you did to MY FACE! Look at my face! Look at it!” <a href="https://x.com/Koreyzzz/status/1995931933600350654">Another player shared an image of their character </a>with darker eyes and mentioned that the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20important%20to,our%20future%20updates.%E2%80%9D">devs had previously promised to make characters look better</a> and didn’t think that this update accomplished that.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You guys are not making any sense. <a href="https://t.co/Rw5vhBi8fW">pic.twitter.com/Rw5vhBi8fW</a></p> <p>— Роман Платонов (@Roman__Platonov) <a href="https://twitter.com/Roman__Platonov/status/1995928606980407603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Some players even claimed that they loaded up the game and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pcfk94/they_changed_my_skin_color/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">found their character</a> had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pchja2/what_did_they_do_to_him/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a totally new skin tone</a>.

Some are even asking EA to revert the change to characters or add a toggle to let people go back to the more cartoony look seen when <em>Skate</em> launched earlier this year.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted EA for more information.</p> <p>I doubt EA will let people toggle between the old and new look, but with how often Skate has been updated and the devs’ commitment to listening to player feedback during the game’s early access development, I expect this won’t be the last time players boot up Skate and discover their characters look a bit different. Hopefully, next time everyone won’t look so tired.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/</link>
            <guid>1371040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Santa Ragione's <em>Horses</em>, the unsettling horror game in which horses are naked human slaves wearing horse masks, won't be released on the Epic Games Store after all. <em>Horses </em>was previously <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio?ref=aftermath.site"><u>banned from release on Valve Software's Steam platform</u></a>, too. Publisher Santa Ragione, which released survival horror game <em>Saturnalia</em> in 2022, announced on Monday that Epic Games alerted the company just 24 hours ahead of its release that the game wouldn't be published on Tuesday.</p><p>Epic Games told Santa Ragione that <em>Horses</em> violates its content guidelines—"specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies," <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a reprint of the message published on the <em>Horses</em> website</u></a>. Epic Games communications director Jake Jones confirmed that the platform "found violations of those guidelines during our extensive review," and pointed Aftermath towards the correspondence published on the <em>Horses</em> website. Santa Ragione "immediately" appealed the decision, it said, but that appeal was rejected.</p><p>Epic Games specifically said it prohibits content that “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated" and "promotes abuse and animal abuse." Santa Ragione denies that <em>Horses</em> includes these things.</p><p><em>Horses </em>is described on its GOG storefront as a "first-person game with live-action sequences." It takes place over the span of fourteen days in-game and will test a player's "obedience, complicity, and restraint" as they play as a college student working on a weird-as-fuck farm. <em>Horses</em>&nbsp;is currently listed on GOG's recent best-selling games page, after only&nbsp;<em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat</em>'s enhanced edition. </p><p><em>Horses </em>has a pretty lengthy content warning, which certainly provides a better understanding of the sort of imagery in the game:</p><p><em>"This game contains scenes of physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny. The inclusion of these elements is intended to depict and characterize a fictional world and its fictional inhabitants. The presence of these elements is not an endorsement of them, nor do they reflect the beliefs or values of the creators. Some scenes also feature unsettling sounds, such as chewing and swallowing, which may be disturbing for players with sound sensitivities or related phobias. Character dialogue also includes references to psychological trauma that may be upsetting, especially for those who may have had similar experiences in their pasts. Player discretion is advised. If you feel uncomfortable or upset while playing, please consider stepping away and reaching out to someone you trust."</em></p><p>The game <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87?ref=aftermath.site"><u>does still have an Epic Game Store page</u></a>; several critics reportedly reviewed the game ahead of launch on the platform, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including IGN</u></a>.</p><p>Epic Games claimed in its email to Santa Ragione that the game received an Adult's Only (AO) rating from the International Age Rating Coalition. Santa Ragione said that when <em>it</em> filled out the IARC questionnaire, it received a PEGI 18 or ESRB M rating. AO rated games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store—except games that received that rating for the inclusion of NFTs or blockchain—but mature or 18+ games are. Aftermath has reached out to IARC for clarification on <em>Horses</em>' rating. Santa Ragione said it submitted its certification of its rating to the Epic Games Store ahead of its release.</p><p>Epic Games wasn't specific about <em>what</em> caused the ban, and neither was Valve when it originally rejected the game from being published on its platform in 2023. Santa Ragione said in late November that the game was banned in 2023 after the company had to upload an early build of the game—a requirement to getting a Steam storefront page up and running. Valve rejected the build without comment, and Santa Ragione said on its website it was likely due to a scene in which a "young girl" rides on the shoulders of a naked adult woman with a horse head. Santa Ragione said it has since changed all characters in the game to be in their 20s or older.</p><p>"Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor," Valve wrote in an automated review sent to the studio, according to the FAQ on the <em>Horses</em> website.</p><p>Santa Ragione said in its FAQ that the Steam ban isn't related to the recent restrictions on adult content that caused <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout/"><u>a major "deindexing" of NSFW games</u></a> on Itch.io and the outright removal of others there and on Steam. That's because Valve's rejection of the game happened in 2023, before conservative activist group Collective Shout's campaign to harass game platforms into removing anything it deemed objectionable. The group went after game platforms by harnessing the power of payment processors—<a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-steam-itch-porn-payment-processors/"><u>with payment processors determining what's acceptable sexual content and what's not</u></a>, platforms like itch.io and Steam complied or risked having access to the processors removed.</p><p>This sort of censorship-by-payment-processor can have a chilling impact on the industry; in an effort to protect children, these restrictions can end up restricting free expression of even mildly-uncomfortable ideas. <em>Horses</em> certainly seems to push up against these restrictions, but its developers said it doesn't cross them: the game is supposed to be "challenging, adult storytelling," the publisher said on its website.</p><p>Guidelines for platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store are often written in such a way that leaves some grey area for certain content—platforms then can apply these restrictions however they'd like, and in ways that often feel confusing to players. Both Epic Games Store and Steam sell sex games and games with graphic violence. For instance, there are a lot of "anime boob games," <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-not-easy-putting-a-gay-sex-game-on-steam-1782457390?ref=aftermath.site"><u>as Nathan put it in 2016</u></a>, but not many gay sex games. He spoke to game developer Robert Yang about getting his games on the platform: Dicks can be used for "exploitation or titillation," but not in the context of sex.</p><p>"We respect players enough to present the game as intended and to let adults choose what to play; lawful works should not be made unreachable by a monopolistic storefront’s opaque decisions," Santa Ragione said. "Steam publicly downplays human curation in favor of algorithmic sales optimization, yet intervenes with censorship when a game’s artistic vision does not align with what the platform owners considers acceptable art. Steam’s behavior passively shapes which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship."</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Merge And Fight monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Seeds, Buckets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Merge And Fight is a fusion of Plants Vs Brainrots and the iconic Plants vs. Zombies title.

Furthermore, one must defeat the most profitable high-HP brainrots to increase their revenue contribution. This is when the active Merge And Fight codes come into play.

New players using the codes will quickly secure the finest early-game brainrots and build the most damage-inflicting plants without grinding.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>update1</strong>&nbsp; – x2 Jalapeno Seed, x3 Iron Bucket, and Damage Potion (New)</li>



<li><strong>cactus</strong> – x2 Cactus Seed, x3 Golden Bucket, x2 Plant Attack Potion, and x5 Freeze Grenade&nbsp;</li>

<p>There are no expired codes as of the writing of this article. You can expect new codes to be released during milestones and major in-game updates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-merge-and-fight-codes">How To Redeem Merge And Fight Codes?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Merge And Fight Code Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow the steps below to redeem all the active codes:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Merge And Fight and spawn on the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hit the “Store” button.</li>



<li>Scroll down to the last or press the “Redeem Code” key to see the code box.</li>



<li>Enter any code into the “Enter Code” text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Press the “Redeem” button to activate the code.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-more-about-merge-and-fight-codes">More About Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>Gears claimed from the active codes have the following use:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Wooden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freeze Grenade – Throws to freeze brainrots for a while.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Shuriken – Throw to deal 120 damage and bounce 2 additional times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gloves – Click to deal 600 damage to brainrots.</li>



<li>Iron Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 3 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Golden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 10 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Damage Potion – All plants ATK +50%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Brainrot Potion – Legendary+ brainrot spawn chance +100%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>Use the free Potions when you see boss brainrots walking down the Brainrot Portal. Freeze Grenades are useful because they can stun high HP brainrots and bring them down slowly. When you place rare plants, they’ll take quite some time to grow. This is when you must use the Bucket gears. They will help you ignore the annoying waiting time and quickly set up a sturdy defence in your garden.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>1370995</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levine-judas-ghost-story-games-art-no-release-date-update/">Three months after its first developer blog</a>, Ghost Story Games and Ken Levine are back to remind everyone that Judas is still around, that the studio is still working on it, and that it is still planning to be released, eventually. On that last point, no, the blog does not include a release date or an indication as to when it'll be out. In fairness, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">a trailer at The Game Awards</a> could give players all the answers they want that are not included in this blog, but we could also just as easily go another year wondering how the spiritual successor to BioShock is coming along.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-2">As far as what the blog does include,</a> we get a new piece of concept art of the game's titular character, Judas. We also hear from several members of the development team, instead of just hearing from Ken Levine, with lead narrative designer Drew Mitchell, lead artist Karen Segars, and studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff all contributing comments on the creative process behind Judas, and more specifically, the development of its main character.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>The project began with us wanting to tell stories that are less linear, that react to the player and unfold in ways that no one’s ever seen in one of Ken’s games</em>," said Mitchell. "<em>That told us a lot up front about what we’d need: namely, characters with strong, competing objectives, who each had a stake in everything the player did. Starting with that framework, we spent a lot of time thinking about those characters, their conflicts, the right setting to force them all together, and the systems underpinning it all. For a long time, there wasn’t even a set protagonist — just sort of a cipher, a blank slate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Eventually, the story and world started to coalesce into something specific, and we needed to figure out who the player character should be. As a rule, you want to put your heroes in the last place they ever want to find themselves. So, what kind of person would really struggle to deal with all these relationships and warring interests? And I remember that was the point where Ken came up with this monologue that kicked everything off.</em>"</p>



<p>Studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff also added comments on how the game's setting evolved in its creation, and how it grew from a more practical location to what it is now. "<em></em><em>At the beginning of its journey, it was a more practical, conventional, modular starship. But over the course of its mission, due to conflict between factions of people and ideals, it's changed into what you see now. And we're working on communicating this through the environment.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Like with any city with significant history, if you start digging up the street, you would find layers of the city's past.  Older eras of street long buried, forgotten, and built over by the roads upon which you now walk.  With the Mayflower as a generational starship, we want to imbue this world with the same sense of time, history, and credibility; this is a civilization that went through eras of conflict and rebirth. And having the characters and the architecture of the world reflect those layers of the onion is a powerful mechanism for visual storytelling. This allows players to act as a sort of historian and architect as they explore the Mayflower. Through uncovering more, you’ll make increasingly informed decisions with the story and characters on your journey.</em>"</p>



<p>All of this is, ultimately, wonderful insight to how Judas has been created in the years since development began, and it's good to see Ghost Story Games communicating to players with a little more frequency than we've seen previously.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this continues, and we'll get an even better look into the game and perhaps even some gameplay soon.</p>

              <p><span>After a week of viral clips and outrage from anime fans and AI-haters alike, Amazon has taken down the AI-generated English dub for </span><i><span>Banana Fish</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The embarrassingly bad dub of the action-packed yaoi was a first for Amazon and was labeled as an “AI Beta” in the series’ language options. Instead of hiring voice actors with all of Jeff Bezos’ fuck you money, Amazon uploaded an AI voice track that is monotone, weirdly mixed, and makes even the most exciting scenes sound like a boring text-to-speech demonstration. Anime is known for its dynamic voice performances, and this shit sounds like it barely gets above a whisper. Here’s a clip, and sorry for putting it somewhere you can hear it:</span></p> <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx/video/7577995965458648328" data-video-id="7577995965458648328" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@animedomainx" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx?refer=embed">@animedomainx</a>  <p>This is Back ngl 🥀 Amazon has started using Al to dub shows, and the first anime to receive an English Al dub is Banana Fish. Many voice actors are speaking out against Amazon’s decision, criticizing the use of Al and the fact that human voice actors were not compensated. Banana Fish is an action-packed crime thriller that follows a young, intelligent gang leader named Ash Lynx as he investigates a mysterious d_rug called “Banana Fish” while trying to protect a pure-hearted Japanese boy, Eiji Okumura, in the dangerous underworld of 1980s New York City Follow For Daily Anime News <a title="bananafish" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bananafish?refer=embed">#BananaFish</a></p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Anime DomainX | Anime News" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7577996058077301511?refer=embed">♬ original sound – Anime DomainX | Anime News</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>  <p><span>After days of ridicule, Amazon has </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-shows/after-widespread-criticism-for-the-use-of-ai-voice-actors-amazon-removes-ai-dub-from-anime-series-banana-fish/"><span>removed the fake English dub</span></a><span> from its streaming services. Bullying works. Hire actors. Bezos has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/"><span>billions of dollars</span></a><span>, and you’re telling me that man can’t afford to put someone in a booth?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As of this writing, the Spanish AI-generated dub is still available, but we’ll see if that lasts. The next question is, will Amazon continue to roll back this decision by releasing a proper English dub with real actors? God knows the company has the money to do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Anime isn’t the only industry that has started relying on generative AI to add voices to creative works. Video games like </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>have AI-generated voices, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-gen-ai-arc-raiders-brendan-green-2000644914"><span>rich people are lining up to tell you</span></a><span> that replacing real voice actors with soulless droning machines is good, actually. A lot of AI apologia relies on the false notion that AI-generated content is good enough to replace human-made work, and if this is the best it has to offer, everyone will continue to rally against it.</span></p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, the studio known for developing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and supporting games like Tomb Raider and others, has had more layoffs.</p>



<p>Over the last week, a number of now former employees took to LinkedIn to announce that they were no longer with the company.</p>







<p><strong>“Hey there!”</strong> gameplay director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398821593012989953/?originTrackingId=HOT3SE08iXRoDN1N9LEmuQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Daher wrote</a>. <strong>“Was working at Eidos, loved it and would have stayed, but times are difficult.”</strong></p>



<p>In total, at least a dozen or more people are now looking for work. This is the second known wave of job cuts at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after 75 people were let go</a> back in March. At the time, it was said that the layoffs were done due to “mandates coming to an end”.</p>



<p>And while one would hope that the latest layoffs are the end, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In recent days, multiple sources have explained to Insider Gaming most projects at the studio have been cancelled. The focus for Eidos-Montreal right now, they say, is on the work it’s doing with Microsoft and Xbox on games like Grounded 2 and Fable. There’s also another internal project that started development in 2019 which, sources say, has no way of recouping its current costs. </p>



<p>After those projects wrap, however, <strong>“additional staff reductions are already forecasted.”</strong></p>







<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to both Eidos-Montreal and its parent company Embracer for comment. As of writing, no responses have been received. In the past, Embracer has often declined to give an official comment on subjects such as layoffs and internal development projects. </p>

Tribute Games, Marvel Cosmic Invasion sees Earth’s Mightiest Mortals team up to take on Annihilus and his Annihilation Wave. Designed to look like an old-school SNES action game with its pixel-art graphics, the game features a roster of 15 heroes. The lineup includes popular characters like Captain America, Storm, and Spider-Man, alongside more obscure heroes like Beta Ray Bill and Quasar, all rendered in a style that evokes classic ’90s video games.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 Buying Guide - Amiibo Restock, Deals On Switch 2 Gear, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upgrade-nintendo-switch-2-storage-with-steeply-discounted-samsung-512gb-microsd-express/1100-6530578/">Last Chance To Get Cyber Monday Deals On MicroSD Express Cards For Switch 2</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controllers-on-sale-for-black-friday/1100-6536412/">DualSense Limited Edition PS5 Controllers On Sale For Black Friday</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-black-friday-game-deals-available-now/1100-6535728/">Check Out Over 200 Nintendo Switch Game Deals For Black Friday</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-switch-exclusive-game-deals/1100-6536453/">Eight Nintendo Switch Exclusives Are 50% Off In Walmart's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The developers said Tuesday they’ve managed to cut down the PC file size for <em>Helldivers 2</em> by about 85 percent, freeing up enough space for at least one or two more large games.</p><p>In a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F553850%2Fview%2F491583942944621371" rel="sponsored">post on the game’s Steam page</a>, the developers explained that they’ve been working on slimming down the game while also adding new content:</p><div><blockquote><p>“The longer term goal has always been to bring the PC installation size much closer in line with the console versions. We are happy to report that, thanks to our partners at Nixxes, we have reached that goal much sooner than expected. By completely de-duplicating our data, we were able to reduce the PC installation size from ~154GB to ~23GB, for a total saving of ~131GB.”</p></blockquote></div><p>The reduction in file size should have a “minimal” impact on load times, “seconds at most,” the developers said. The original file size was significantly larger because the developers were duplicating game asset data to improve load times on mechanical HDDs, which they estimate about 11 percent of <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are currently using.</p><p>However, as the post on the update explains, the developers now know that load times in <em>Helldivers 2</em> are mainly due to level generation, not loading game assets, so duplicating asset data was offering minimal benefit and impacting a small percentage of players (while making the file size larger for everyone).</p><p>Anyone with the PC version of <em>Helldivers 2</em> can opt in for the technical public beta on Steam to get the “slim” version of the game, which will eventually become the default version after the developers iron out any remaining issues that come up in beta testing.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/836948/helldivers-2-file-size-decrease]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new leak on social media for Fortnite hints at a huge collaboration with South Park. The event, if true, would have several big elements like a Rift Anomaly and multiple mech skins.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been off to a great start for fans. Not only did players get&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, but skins for Back to the Future and a new map. With the live-service title collabing with basically every IP out there, there’s one vulgar one that would feel right at home: South Park. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors of a collab</a> have been here and there, but one reliable Twitter user dropped a huge leak as to what South Park will be like in Fortnite.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SOUTH PARK x FORTNITE IS A BIG COLLAB</p><p>• MULTIPLE SKINS AS MECHS<br>• Rift Anomaly: "Everyone Kills Kenny"  <br>• At least 1 Boss on the map<br>• Stick of Truth Mythic<br>• Respawn Token/Medallion<br>• Unknown Consumable<br>&amp; more.. <a href="https://t.co/veNGth1U9k">pic.twitter.com/veNGth1U9k</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a well-known leaker in the Fortnite community. They’ve gotten many details from past seasons correct and are generally accurate. This time, the leak pertains to South Park, as it is seemingly making its way into Fortnite. While no date was given as to when, information regarding the collab has dropped.</p>



<p>As it seems, the Fortnite x South Park collab will feature skins for the mechs and a few collectibles. However, the biggest ones are that a Boss will spawn on the map relating to the adult-animated series. Furthermore, a Rift Anomaly, aptly titled “Everyone Kills Kenny,” will be part of it, though no details on how it will play out were stated.</p>



<p>Given the recent popularity of South Park, it’s no surprise to see it collaborate with Fortnite. It wouldn’t be South Park’s first foray into gaming, as the show has garnered two RPGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-park-snow-day-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other tie-in games</a>. In fact, South Park: The Stick of Truth was a hit with critics and fans, being a near-ideal translation from its TV counterpart. While Fortnite’s version may be toned down for the player base, it’s sure to hit the same marks it did in 1997.</p>

<p>This new patch brings all of the tweaks and additions made to other versions of the game (which we reckon is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">really very good</a>, actually) to Switch 1 and 2, so there's total parity across all versions.</p>
<p>That means the Switch releases have received the CPU Ranked Match mode, the new "Advance Win" feature — which allows you to call time on matches with huge leads (as well as some anti-cheat measures for online) — and a bunch of other tweaks and fixes to boot.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067irmjpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The game's executive producer (and Level-5 CEO, lest we forget), Akihiro Hino, dropped the full deets <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1995815684304150948?s=20">on social media</a>, although we are still awaiting some more detailed patch notes. Here's the tweet, plus the machine translation below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest version of Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Victory Road has been updated. The versions are 1.4.0 and 1.4.1. Distribution will begin on each platform at various times. It will be after 9 PM for all platforms. The time may be subject to change.<br>
・Advance Win, Advance Time<br>
・First-time route unlock battle: Kizuna Star x5<br>
・AI ranked match<br>
And so on, including bug fixes, many new features will be implemented across platforms including Switch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this latest update, alongside 1.3's added ranked level cap and bug fixes, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is certainly in good shape, and looking and playing every bit the soccer star that it is!</p>
<p>The game launched back in the middle of November, and Ethan called it "the franchise’s most premium experience yet" in our recent review:</p>

		<p>Ghost Story Games, the studio founded by BioShock creator Ken Levine, has released a new short teaser for its upcoming FPS Judas. This little teaser shows different environments of The Mayflower, the colony ship that Judas, the main character, lives on. The Mayflower is an environment filled with decades of changes, which Judas has to navigate along with the different relationships which she finds difficult to do.</p>
<p><iframe title="Judas Environment Themes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O-29-fOEE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new Judas dev log, the team said, <em>“We put her in a science fiction world, a colony ship filled with robots — a futuristic setting that makes someone like her extremely powerful. But it’s also a world where personal success hinges on how well you can conform to the rules, because dissent would lead to the failure of the mission. That makes her an outlaw, a pariah — a Judas. That tension at the heart of the character came to inform everything about the game, which we stopped thinking of as an FPS and started calling a “Judas Simulator.” Everything comes back to that core idea of you interacting with the world as Judas.”</em></p>
<p>The Mayflower is split into different sections from VIP Pilgrim Quarters, Regular Pilgrim Dorms, and Violator Quarters with each having its own distinct style. These styles show the divides within a society where the citizens have devolved into a bitter battle of constantly spying on one another and dobbing one another in for even the slightest offences. It’s machines, not people who are in control of business, art, government, and they’re trying to turn the humans into robotic model citizens.</p>

<p>Judas does not have a release date yet, but it is expected for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> season five’s finale episode, which is also the series finale, will go live on Netflix on New Year’s Eve. To celebrate that, Lego and Netflix have teamed up with the series creators to create a $300 set that I’m not sure really hits the mark. And I’m a big <em>Stranger Things</em> fan and Lego sicko.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-creel-house-lego-set">Lego and Netflix revealed a new elaborate <em>Stranger Things</em>-themed set</a> that is based on the <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Creel_House">Creel House first seen in season four</a>. This is the place where a young Henry Creel lived and where some horrific shit went down. It also ended up being the home base for season four’s big bad monster man, Vecna. And while that does mean the Creel House is a very important piece of Stranger Things lore, I’m not excited to spend $300 on what mostly looks like a Lego haunted house set.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/stranger-things-the-creel-house-11370">The Creel House Lego set contains 2,593 pieces and 13 minifigs</a>: Eleven, Will, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Steve, Nancy, Robin, Jonathan, Max, Holly, Mr. Whatsit, and Vecna himself. It also includes two vehicle builds. As you might expect, it contains a lot of Easter eggs referencing moments from every season of the popular Netflix series. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit about this set is that it can be split in a way that reveals the “interdimensional horror” below, with Lego and Netflix calling it the “first-ever transforming LEGO house.”</p>

 <p>“We grew up obsessed with the LEGO brand, so seeing <i>Stranger Things</i> rebuilt in bricks is honestly surreal,” explained <em>Stranger Things</em> creators Ross and Matt Duffer. “With the show heading into its final chapter — and hitting the 10-year mark — bringing the Creel House to life this way feels like the perfect celebration of the world and the fans who made all of this possible.”</p>

 <p>Personally, I’d have been much more interested in a Lego diorama recreating Hawkins or a few smaller sets depicting iconic locations and moments from the show that connect into a nice display piece. Something that feels instantly recognizable as <em>Stranger Things.</em> But at least for $300, the house looks detailed, splits apart, and contains a ton of figs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">I’ll be spending dumb amounts of money on a different big Lego set based on a popular show soon, so I’ll be passing on this house set</a>.</p> <p>The Creel House set will be available to buy on New Year’s Day, about 24 hours after the finale airs. Makes me wonder if there are some interesting spoilers hidden in the set. <em>Stranger Things</em> <em>Vol. 1</em> is out now on Netflix. <em>Vol 2.</em> arrives on December 25. And the finale airs on New Year’s Eve.</p>

      <p>Anime fans rarely unilaterally agree on anything. However, fans on Twitter were all outraged by the unveiling of the atrocious Prime Video's AI Beta. The product is a mess of generative AI that dubs anime with the stunted cadence of a run-of-the-mill text-to-speech program, and is somehow a product from a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAU87ypjydpiKl3SoY-9JU2L1BHhtZYNziutw31b28xk0rcQNgJyP2mHZvKTBKTnnLGmYx3DTUnF17fKuth6R9etLdLC4QOgg36WDoVk2w1P-BwZ2QmywyZaI41GZ-963LLq7YAL0_AnqTrNeXYlyVZUUlWmR3vhSA5k2Z0Wfcw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>$2.5 trillion company</u></a>.</p><p>Over Thanksgiving weekend, anime fans noticed that Prime Video quietly released new language tracks for <em>Banana Fish</em> and <em>No Game No Life</em>—two years-old anime that might not be uber popular in mainstream circles but are fondly remembered as formative series. <em>Banana Fish</em> in particular is known among fans for its explicit queer themes, having been based on a landmark shojo manga that deeply influenced how homosexuality is depicted in the genre. Getting an English dub for such a series <em>should</em> be like getting an early Christmas present. But that joy was misplaced: both shows were given an <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-anime-ai-dub-banana-fish-no-game-no-life-2000693962?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI Beta English dub track</u></a> that sucked worse than the <a href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1994583024802189814?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>most archaic dubs vs. subs detractor</u></a> could ever imagine.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon's AI English Dub for Banana Fish is hilariously bad at times.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BANANAFISH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#BANANAFISH</a> <a href="https://t.co/CtiE47W4yh?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/CtiE47W4yh</a></p>— Otaku Spirit (@OtakuSpirited) <a href="https://twitter.com/OtakuSpirited/status/1994598770202611749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote>

The program was released on March 5 in English and Latin American Spanish for 12 licensed movies and series, including foreign works such as José Pozo's 2003 animated film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cid:_The_Legend?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>El Cid: La Leyenda</u></em></a>, Martín Musarra's 2016 drama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6264558/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Mi Mamá Lora</u></em></a>, and Erik Bloomquist's mystery film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282278/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Long Lost</u></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>By the way, <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@amazon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@PrimeVideo</a> pay MAYBE $125-$150 / hour to English voice actors, even through SAG-AFTRA Union rates.

</figure><p>As a way to combat this distressing trend, anime fans warned those among us prone to hate watching not even to give Prime Video the satisfaction of an uptick in viewers and instead post that they <a href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1994561238551204005?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>wouldn't be renewing their paid Prime memberships</u></a>. Prime memberships, mind you, cost $2.99 extra on top of a $14.99 membership to remove ads on their streaming service, and which also grant you one free Twitch prime sub.

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Banana Fish AI-generated dub on Amazon is so fucking atrocious; it's almost tragic how lifeless it sounds, the intonations are all wrong, and it's a slap in the face not just to artists, actors, and the media itself, but the fans as well.

</figure><p>However, the public shaming appears to have reached someone important.As on Monday morning, the feature was quietly removed, eliminating AI Beta English dub tracks for both anime.

</figure><p>To illustrate how much of a non-issue an official production of an English dub for <em>Banana Fish</em>—something not uncommon with anime, especially if they're newly licensed on a new streaming platform—would've run Prime Video roughly $125-$150 an hour per session, even through SAG-AFTRA Union rates. Basically, this is peanuts compared to what the show has already burned through on content mill-brained titles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games/"><em><u>Beast Games</u></em></a>. But, like everything fueling the AI bubble, companies still compete to out unga bunga each other to make even better ways to boil the ocean to make shit no one wants. Prime Video didn't even opt for the tried and true method of asking for forgiveness instead of permission; Instead, they are apparently playing this nine-month initiative as an oopsie that it hopes will blow over while people flock to Cyber Monday deals. Time will tell if that cowardly gambit pays off, but history shows it has worked for other streamers, and we shouldn't let it continue.</p><p>Back in 2023, Netflix caught ire for listing AI as a creator in the credits for its WIT Studio anime, <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-ai-anime-wit-studio-dog-and-boy-spy-family-1850062043?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dog and Boy</u></em></a>. In a post from Netflix Japan (which Vice translated), the account characterized the whole deal as "As an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts!” As <em>Kotaku</em> noted, a human creative likely had to handhold the AI to spit out whatever that film, which'll return to obscurity once you've finished this sentence. At the same time, animation freelancers continue to be <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anime+news+network+acen+2025+Isaiah+Colbert&amp;sca_esv=9370fbfcff6639a9&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifPIQwVBrK1GDGrjzMewD4Q-_Tt2eQ%3A1764695661663&amp;ei=bR4vae-bKLehptQPyPviqA4&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivhrPQs5-RAxW3kIkEHci9GOUQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=anime+news+network+acen+2025+Isaiah+Colbert&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiK2FuaW1lIG5ld3MgbmV0d29yayBhY2VuIDIwMjUgSXNhaWFoIENvbGJlcnQyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAFIkRZQ-AJYkBVwAXgBkAEAmAGVAqABzRCqAQYxLjEzLjG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAhCgAp8RwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICBRAhGKsCwgIFECEYnwXCAgcQIRigARgKmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcGMS4xNC4xoAf7QrIHBjAuMTQuMbgHmxHCBwYwLjExLjXIByw&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>paid a pittance</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, that same year, Disney+ caught flak, however briefly, for <a href="https://gizmodo.com/secret-invasion-ai-art-opening-credits-marvel-vfx-1850560454?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Secret Invasion</u></em></a> having an AI-generated opening sequence. Another example of a company oopsie daisying one too many times is Crunchyroll, who just this year, after months of reassuring gunshy fans that it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081180/crunchyroll-president-purini-anime-funimation-shutdown-sony-merger-decoder-interview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>no plans to implement AI in any of its programming</u></a>, was spotted by a user who saw <a href="https://aftermath.site/chatgpt-crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-necronomicon/"><u>ChatGPT explicitly written in the German subtitling of <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em></u></a>—a show I've been told is decent but whose reputation will forever be entwined with ChatGPT even after the whole thing was rectified.

</figure><p>All this to say, we can't just let companies like Prime Video get away with the wanton use of AI, only to sweep it under the rug, like pretending a mosquito bite never happened if you ignore the itch long enough. The only way these perpetual AI rake steps can have their legs cut out from under them is if fans show they care by being loud every time that artless slop rears its head. Let them sit in agony for their self-inflicted wound. Bullying works, folks. And the only way to keep art alive is to bully corpos and keep the pressure on. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-voice-acting-soundalike-video-games/"><div><p>‘It’s Just Not Impressive If A Robot Is Doing It:’ Soundalike Voice Actors On AI - Aftermath</p><p>Jennifer Hale joins voice actors calling for ethical boundaries as AI reshapes (and erases) the traditions of soundalike performances</p><p><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>The first time I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> was, of course, the day it launched. 2010 really doesn't seem all that long ago at all, but there was a level of expectation and excitement to those opening moments in Rockstar's utterly wild West that I <em>do</em> feel I haven't experienced in a very long time indeed.</p>
<p>It was an excitement that had me on my phone to an equally exuberant friend (we'd been to buy our copies together earlier that day, like something out of a Dickens novel), as we both gawped in amazement at this incredible recreation of a lost world. Do games still drop jaws in the same way that a big Rockstar joint used to back in the day?</p>
<p>As the camera settled on John Marston aboard the game's opening train ride, as we started to get a gauge on just how no-holds-barred and authentic this particular cowboy adventure was gonna be, there was an air of something special, of a game that might just be everything we'd wanted and more besides. And it was!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/red-dead-redemption">I reviewed Red Dead Redemption on Switch</a> for its 2023 release, so check that out for a full run-through of the finer details of the game itself. However, I <em>'only'</em> gave it an 8/10, which may seem odd given all the gilding of its lily I've just done above this very paragraph. But a lack of multiplayer, alongside a lack of polish overall, meant it had to go down as a barebones port. Still amazing in its narrative and gameplay, but in need of TLC. It was eminently playable, and already looked nice, though, so you were in safe (if unspectacular) hands on Switch.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:154041 @ 1764712836 -->
<p>This Switch 2 update, on paper, gives us the basics and no more, too. Oh, you've given it more resolution, have you? Increased the frame rate? Well done. But wait. We've now got mouse controls for fine-aiming, and they feel really good. Also, and as expected as resolution or frame rate increases are nowadays, my goodness, it really does look and feel very nice indeed. Have I ever played this game at 60fps before? I'm beginning to wonder, because I'm sure it's never played this nicely.</p>
<p>Remember the journey into Mexico, that magical bit with the music, the showstopping part? It's all the more magical when you can see the very dust in the air, the shimmering heat haze in the distance now as clear as day thanks to pristine visuals. HDR is really helping to make things pop in comparison to the older port, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Yes, there's still no multiplayer, but it now feels as though the game is being presented on a Nintendo console in a manner befitting such an epic slice of gaming history. With slick controls, DLSS, HDR, volumetric effects, options to personalise mouse mode, 60fps that felt flawless, and a resolution bump that's got it looking super sharp, this is a gem that <em>still</em> feels modern, immediate, and relentlessly replayable on Switch 2. Now that's rootin' tootin', partners!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1370899</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Santa Ragione's horror game, Horses, <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/">getting banned on Steam with only vague reasons to back up its ban</a> was an additional tally on the year for Valve getting mixed up in controversy <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">regarding what it allows and what it doesn't allow on Steam</a>. Epic Games Store, seemingly, felt out of the loop, so it decided to join the fray by also disallowing Horses to release on its digital storefront, even though it was previously slated to arrive alongside launches at <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?hmb_source=search_bar">Humble</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> today, December 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The difference, however, is typical of the difference between Epic Games Store and Steam. Whatever Steam does, the Epic Games Store does worse. When Steam banned Horses, it did so based on an early, unfinished version of the game, and kept its exact reasoning and policies around why it was banned vague enough, preventing Santa Ragione from refuting direct issues Valve seemingly had with the game.</p>



<p>Epic Games, however, banned Horses approximately 24 hours before it was set to launch on the EGS. Per <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">Santa Ragione's website for Horses</a>, Epic told the Italian indie developer that it is "<em>Unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies.</em>"</p>







<p>The email continued, "<em></em><em>The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which 'contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.' The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.</em> <em>This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology).</em>"</p>



<p>But prior to this email, Horses was set to be available on the EGS and had been approved for release on the store. So what changed? That's the million-dollar question, it would seem, especially because elements that Epic is claiming are in the game simply aren't there, according to Santa Ragione.</p>



<p>"<em>The game does NOT contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," </em>the studio claims in a statement<em>. "All nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation. There is never any visible sexual act involving genitalia and all animations are stylized and unrealistic. Additionally, in the three hours of gameplay contained in the game, there are only four brief and censored sexual sequences, with two of them happening mainly off camera</em>...<em>the content presented does not in any way promote abuse (including animal abuse). The game is a strong critique of violence and abuse in general.</em>"</p>



<p>Santa Ragione also pointed out that when it filled out the IARC Questionnaire as part of the process to get approved for release on the EGS in the first place, it received a PEGI 18 and M for Mature rating, not an AO rating.</p>



<p>Even with these reminders, and Santa Ragione begging its contact at Epic Games Store to consider the fact that builds of this game had been approved multiple times, with a final achievement build getting approved well over two weeks ahead of launch. Santa Ragione received no reply from its contact, instead getting an automated message that its appeal had been denied. Epic also failed to point to a specific instance of content within Horses it took issue with, so even if Santa Ragione wanted to make changes to release on EGS, it doesn't know where Epic believes the problem lies.</p>



<p>The whole way this story has evolved is extremely unfortunate, because here is an indie developer whose work revolves around trying to elevate the kinds of stories we can tell in video games, the subject matter tackled, and how more serious issues are tackled, that will likely now be shuttered because it won't be able to recoup development costs for its latest, and now potentially last, release. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier this year, Steam allowed a game <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">that directly promoted sexual abuse to appear on its store, and had to be told to remove it</a>, only doing so in select regions. It was the developers themselves who eventually took it down entirely.</p>



<p>One of these games is a commentary and critique on abuse, the other contained explicit abuse and sexual violence for entertainment. It's frankly disturbing that the latter was able to make it onto Steam, while the former isn't given a place on the store at all.</p>

                <p>Obsidian has announced that the planned fall update for Avowed is not going to make it on time. The features planned for the update are still coming, but they are now going to be wrapped into a "larger update" instead in February 2026 to celebrate the game's first anniversary.</p><p>"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet.

"Avowed's impactful and satisfying combat is undone by a widely unbalanced upgrade system and an uninteresting story that wastes its potential," reviewer Alessandro Barbosa said.</p><p>Like all of Microsoft's other games, Avowed is available with Xbox Game Pass. The game's director, Carrie Patel, said she was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-want-more-avowed-so-does-the-games-director/1100-6529664/" data-ref-id="1100-6529664">interested in making more Avowed</a>, but no sequel has been announced as of yet and Patel has since left Obsidian.</p><p>Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-was-originally-pitched-with-multiplayer-like-destiny-mixed-with-skyrim/1100-6529651/">was originally pitched as a multiplayer-centric game that married Destiny with Skyrim</a>.

                <p>Veteran games executive and former Nexon CEO, Owen Mahoney, believes the video game industry is on the cusp of a massive transformation--and that AI is at the center of it. He argues that AI is already integrated into many aspects of game development, from asset production to testing tools, and that its impact will only intensify.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-man-who-signed-arc-raiders-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Mahoney explains that the AAA sector is facing what he bluntly calls an "end-of-days" moment. Costs are skyrocketing, development cycles are slowing, and publishers are becoming increasingly risk-averse, adding that the industry often misunderstands where value truly comes from.</p><p>Responding to examples of failed studios with prestigious founders, Mahoney says, "The examples that you just gave were, 'We bought this company because five years ago they made some game. So, therefore they're good.' It doesn’t work that way at all," and insists that the "game companies are really just collections of people." He believes that success depends on understanding their motivation and creative drive, not past hits.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_KdS6TNHL8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W_KdS6TNHL8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mahoney contrasts Embark's success with the broader structural problems holding AAA development back. He describes the impossible situation faced by public-company CEOs.</p><p>"You're running a $23 billion company. And you have to make a decision, in a very short period of time, to greenlight a project ... if that new project doesn't do well, you're going to be explaining to your board why you burnt $300 million in company cash," he said.</p><p>He continues that one failure is survivable, but "if you do it again, they're going to be calling openly for your head, and by the third time you'll have an activist investor." Mahoney thinks this kind of pressure makes executives fund only familiar ideas, worsening the cycle. "The AAA industry is structurally at its end," he adds.</p><p>Despite this bleak diagnosis, Mahoney is optimistic about what AI could unlock. He acknowledges that AI has "an unbelievable ability to create a lot of slop, but so does Photoshop." He even argues that audiences will continue "rejecting slop and bad product and only demanding good product."</p><p>More importantly, he sees AI as a force that will empower smaller teams, shorten development timelines, and introduce entirely new forms of play, just as the internet once did. "I continue to believe that the industry will probably triple in the next five to seven years. Just like every major wave [of technology] has had a major positive impact on the video games industry. The nature of the medium itself is changing, and that’s very, very good for us."</p>

<p>In our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed, Stefan said, <em>“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</em></p>
