		<p>Undead Labs has released the 38th and final update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/state-of-decay-2">State of Decay 2</a>, as they look to put the full team’s efforts into the sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-gets-a-big-re-reveal-with-a-new-story-trailer/">State of Decay 3</a>.</p>
<p>State of Decay 2 Update 38 puts a bow on things with a focus on fixing some long-standing issues, making some quality of life improvements, making gated and seasonal content more freely available, and even adding a batch of new cosmetics as a parting thank you.</p>


<p>Originally releasing in 2018, State of Decay 2 has now had a solid six years of support from Undead Labs. It launched on Xbox One and PC <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/17/state-of-decay-2-review/">in a pretty rough state</a> – echoing the first game – but still with plenty of appeal and charm. With the Juggernaut Edition and Xbox Series X|S enhancements, and the steady stream of updates, the game is now in a very good place, looking at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2_Juggernaut_Edition/#app_reviews_hash">the Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>The sequel was announced back in 2020 during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-pc-trailer/">Xbox Series X|S summer showcase</a>, but it took four long years before we would see the game reappear, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-gets-a-big-re-reveal-with-a-new-story-trailer/">re-reveal coming at this year’s summer showcase</a>. The third game looks to lean even further into the community side of the game, jumping ahead in time some more and featuring a larger, truly shared world.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Quality of Life Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<p>Water will Slow Vehicles – Water resistance will now reduce vehicle speed while travelling through lakes and waterways. Be sure to choose the right vehicle type for the job as each handles differently. A 4×4, for example, will outperform a Sports Coupe in the water.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p>Community Inventories – While over in the base, you can now access individual Survivors’ inventories from the Community screen, allowing you to quickly view or equip their items, transfer items between you, or store their gear (including rucksacks) into base storage. No more hunting around the base to find the Survivor you need!</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p>Zombie spawning has been removed after certain noise events – Failed search crashes and door slams will no longer spawn new zombies. These noise events will now simply attract already existing zombies to the location.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>We’ve reduced the distance at which characters automatically attempt to climb down from ledges. Additionally, characters will no longer attempt to climb down unintentionally whilst the player is aiming, which could often lead to some frustrating moments.</li>
<li>Rucksacks can now be deposited at claimed Landmark Outposts.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The likelihood of the Blood Donor Enclave Arc appearing has been adjusted to match that of the other Arcs.</li>
<li>The Blood Donor Morale Bonus has been adjusted to +6 Community Morale, down from the previous value of +15, which was deemed too strong.</li>
<li>The following weapons can be obtained as rewards for defeating the Black Heart and killing a Jugg during the Gargantua Mutation Curveball: RTX Piranha, RTX Rampart, RTX Cyclone, RTX Cyclone Tactical, and MCX Osprey RT.</li>
<li>In response to community feedback that it was appearing too frequently, the delay and cooldown for the Bangernomics Curveball have been somewhat increased.</li>
<li>There is now a chance for new characters to receive the Blood Donor trait.</li>
<li>Prone Zombies set up to ambush now have an increased sight range from 1m to 6m, allowing them to react more quickly to approaching characters.</li>
<li>The health of the Gargantua Mutation Juggernauts has been increased for each level of Impact in the Curveball Settings.</li>
<li>The Haven Device has been rebalanced to improve it’s overall effectiveness. It will now have a noticeable presence over the course of multiple waves during a base siege.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Gameplay Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the reliability of the automatic ladder interaction which would sometimes fail, causing the character to walk right over the ladder and fall from a height.</li>
<li>You can now build a staging area after claiming the Leeds Concrete Silos landmark. Additionally, the previous issue of the ‘Elimination of Daily Materials Cost’ stacking has been resolved.</li>
<li>Using heavy weapons now correctly grants Endurance XP as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Zombie and Combat Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in which Zombies sometimes became unresponsive after getting stuck in their idle state.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which the finisher prompt appeared when a finishing move could not be executed due to lack of stamina.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which Zombies would sometimes attack and magnetically teleport towards survivors on upper levels.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a downed hostile human would remain incapacitated indefinitely.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where melee attacks missed when they should have hit.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Ferals could instantly destroy certain vehicles by attaching to and attacking specific points.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in which Blood Plague Bloaters were not appearing in Heartland Hordes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Curveball Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Radio Silence Curveball could not appear correctly in Drucker County, Cascade Falls, and Meagher Valley.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where Ignited Zombies during the Fuelling the Plague Curveball were not receiving any damage from weapons.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where Armored Zombies persisted after the Lost Platoon Curveball had expired.</li>
<li>Removed the unintended instances where the same Curveball could appear twice simultaneously.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that caused Curveball objectives to be unpinned or removed from the Goals menu when their Optional Objective was completed.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where some Curveball effects did not update after changing Impact in the Curveball settings.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Vicious Rumours Curveball displayed incorrect values when adjusting the impact in the Curveball settings. Previously, the ‘Less Influence Received from Selling’ minor effect had major values, and vice versa, causing the curveball to reduce the influence gained from trading more than intended.</li>
<li>Resolved various issues where the Vicious Rumours Curveball did not increase the radio prices for the Independence Pack and the Locate Plague Heart radio command.</li>
<li>Adjusted Vicious Rumours to display the correct sell prices when the Curveball is active.</li>
<li>Adjusted the Curveball Stamina action effects in ‘Up and At Em’ and ‘Under the Weather’ to account for all stamina-cost actions.</li>
<li>Reimplemented the damage warning that triggers when entering the Toxic Miasma of a Black Heart.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which Curveballs appearing could cause a crash on multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mission Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resolved a crash issue that occurred when approaching the mission location for one of the ‘Mysterious Broadcast’.</li>
<li>Resolved the issue where Zombies from infestations were not spawning in taller buildings (such as the Factory Husk in Heartland), which prevented clearing the infestation and potentially blocking certain missions.</li>
<li>Resolved an exploit in Heartland where the CLEO Supply drop mission could be bypassed by leaving the site and returning to zero Zombies, which auto-completed the mission. Now, the mission will be abandoned and must be redone.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in ‘Living in a Materials World’ where the optional objective might be impossible to complete under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in ‘Builder Legacy: Useful Utilities’ where Energy Drinks now count towards completing the objective of building an item that requires power or water</li>
</ul>
<h4>UI and Settings Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reduced max curveball cards visible in the journal and introduced enhancements to the functionality, user interface, and reliability of the Curveball Journal Page, including correct presentation of different languages in the prompt bar.</li>
<li>Resolved the issue of community names being truncated on the community selection screen.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the FOV value reset after updating the Accessibility settings.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with luxury crates missing exclamation marks on certain items.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug where the vehicle UI indicated it was destroyed even after being repaired with a toolkit.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue with inconsistent appearance and function for the ‘Drop’ prompt on your character inventory when interacting with a vehicle trunk.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Locker Icon disappeared at short distances, making it difficult to find.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Curveballs have Awoken notification appeared every time a session was reloaded.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/noted-board-game-and-tabletop-names-form-gamers4harris-supporting-harris-campaign<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today a large number of influential names from the board game and tabletop space have announced their support and endorsement for Kamala Harris for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Gamers4Harris is a group of 700+ "creators of your favorite games" that want to support Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz.</p>
<p>In the statement release on the official <a href="https://gamers4harris.org/">Gamers4Harris website</a>&nbsp;the group explains that they see Harris as a winner. "She has&nbsp;presided over the best economy in the world. She’s an ardent defender of reproductive rights. She has battled crime, fought for the downtrodden, and supported American workers. She stands with our allies and stands up to our enemies abroad. She knows how things are done, and she gets them done."</p>
<p>The statement continues to explain that in Harris and Walz they see a mix of competitiveness as well as a spirit of cooperation. Key aspects of their campaign that the group highlights is Harris' ability to so quickly unify the party around her and building a solid campaign so quickly. Walz achievements have also been noted including how he has expanded "the safety net, lifted up his constituents, and done it with charm and grace. Plus, he loves his Sega Dreamcast. Our kind of guy."</p>
<p>On the topic of "the other guys" Gamers4Harris label them "Cheaters. They run on fear, rage, and denial of rights. [...]&nbsp;Project 2025 spells out a fascist agenda that will destroy the government and the rights of Americans. Trump is an insurrectionist grifter who’s been found liable for sexual assault, convicted of fraud, fined hundreds of millions of dollars, and is facing years in jail."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We make games because we like competition and cooperation. We’ve been given two candidates who express those qualities beautifully. If you like our games, do us and yourselves a solid. - Gamers4Harris</p>
</blockquote>

Another returning element is quick-time events (QTEs), which are called Impact Actions in-game. The general gaming audience may not miss having to mash button prompts on a screen, but this is something that fans have been especially excited about.<br></p><p>There are four different types of Impact Actions, and each one has its own unique QTE minigame. While it’s a pretty cool inclusion, they’re not all clear about how they work—and each one having its own distinctive UI doesn’t help.</p><p>The training mode does go over them, but it doesn’t do a great job explaining things, nor how the boost function works.

Pressing the prompt will stop the circle, with your job being to get it as close as possible to the center. Don’t feel bad if you miss-time it at first because it does shrink deceptively fast. <strong>This is an important step because whoever stops it closer to the center will win the Speed Impact.</strong></p><h3 id="h18986"><a id=""></a><strong>Stage 2</strong></h3><p>Coming after that is the Rapid Strike stage. No matter who won the first stage, the objective is to mash the shown button prompt as fast as you can. The winner will be doing this to increase the damage they inflict, and the loser will mash to mitigate it. The Speed Impact ends with the winner punching the loser hard enough to send them flying.</p><p>As with every Impact Action, you can also press the Boost Button (RT/R2) for some helpful bonuses. It can be used once during the Single Strike stage to make the timing more lenient. In the Rapid Strike stage, it can be used up to three times to enhance your attacks. This one has the most times available to boost, which also means it’s the easiest to overdo it. Each Boost takes up one gauge of ki, and using too much will put you in a Collapsed state. You’ll be forced to recover and will lose your chance to follow up.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-recommend-id="image://d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku and Vegeta push against each other during a Power Impact, with a spiral gauge between them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku and Vegeta push against each other during a Power Impact, with a spiral gauge between them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-recommend-id="image://d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku and Vegeta push against each other during a Power Impact, with a spiral gauge between them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Both players performing a Throw at close range will trigger a Power Impact. This won’t work against larger characters like Anilaza or Giant Form Lord Slug, so I don’t recommend trying. If it’s timed right, both characters will push against each other with their hands.<br></p><p>A spiral gauge will display in the middle of the screen, along with a button prompt. <strong>It’s best to imagine this minigame like a pressure meter.</strong> Holding the button down will fill it up, while releasing will let it fall. Allowing it to touch the yellow line in the center will cause it to fall and momentarily disable the button. The winner is decided by who has it filled the most.</p><p>It doesn’t last that long, so the trick here is to keep it as close to the maximum without overloading it. You might find it easier to hold it near the end and then resort to tapping to keep it close by.

To be completely honest though, I’ve never noticed any difference. I’ve seen some claim that it helps with accuracy, but no aspect of the QTE seems to support that idea.

I’d only recommend using the boost if you’re constantly on the losing end with this minigame.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-recommend-id="image://63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vegeta fires a Galick Gun into the colorful mess that is a Blast Impact." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vegeta fires a Galick Gun into the colorful mess that is a Blast Impact." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-recommend-id="image://63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vegeta fires a Galick Gun into the colorful mess that is a Blast Impact." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Last, but certainly not least, is everyone’s favorite.

Instead of pressing the button prompt to charge, you’ll need to quickly rotate the left or right sticks on your controller.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ten-years-later-guerrilla-admits-it%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98done%E2%80%99-with-killzone.1016622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-done-with-killzone-ten-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It could be argued that Killzone <strong>made </strong>Guerrilla. The intense, alt-universe first-person shooter debuted in 2004 on PlayStation 2, introducing a next-generation title with a phenomenal setting and story. It spawned four major follow-up titles and a couple of spin-offs, but since 2013, the franchise has stood abandoned by Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most-called-for games when the topic of revitalising a forgotten franchise comes to the table but in a recent interview, the team at Guerrilla confirmed it has long since been <strong>done </strong>with Killzone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-by-choice">‘It Was By Choice’</h2>



<p>In 2017, Guerrilla Games released Horizon Zero Dawn, a post-apocalyptic PlayStation 4 exclusive that turned heads with ease. It was vibrant and punchy, and it represented an entire world of opportunity and freedom. It was the team’s first game since 2013’s beleaguered Killzone Shadow Fall, which many considered the final nail in the coffin for the shooter series.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed in an interview that Horizon Zero Dawn spelt the ultimate end for Killzone, with Guerrilla fully pivoting away from their gritty FPS to focus on more colourful horizons – no pun intended.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were done with it as a team. As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette. It was, by choice, the opposite of Killzone. I think the themes that this story and the characters represent are relatable for all ages and people, like having a found family of friends and finding your place in the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was a quote taken from Roy Postma, a Guerrilla legend with more than two decades at the firm. He was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">talking to the Washington Post</a> about Lego Horizon Adventures, a cutesy version of Horizon set to launch in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Hearing the words ‘done with it’ sent a shock through my soul. Killzone was one of the first games I fell in love with as a kid. I poured hundreds of hours into it, and it introduced me to the world of first-person shooters – and multiplayer FPS combat. I always knew that the return of the series would be a one-in-a-million chance, but now we’ve got it on paper and confirmed.</p>



<p>Do you rue the loss of Killzone? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine this: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is loaded up on your PC. You are about to jump into your first game of Team Deathmatch, but the game crashes. Turns out your PC can’t handle the game at its full graphics settings. Here are the best Black Ops 6 graphics settings for PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-best-graphics-settings-for-pc">Black Ops 6: Best Graphics Settings for PC</h2>



<p>Sure, if you are a millionaire you may be able to afford the right hardware to run a game like Black Ops 6 at its full graphics settings. Many people, however, will need to make some adjustments to make the game run more smoothly.</p>



<p>Here are the most optimal graphic settings for Black Ops 6 on PC:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet Impacts:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Particle Resolution:</strong> Very low</li>



<li><strong>Depth of Field:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Persistent Effects:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Shader Quality:</strong> Medium</li>



<li><strong>Texture Resolution:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Detail Quality Level:</strong> Low</li>



<li><strong>Display Monitor:</strong> Primary monitor</li>



<li><strong>Variable Rate Shading:</strong> On</li>



<li><strong>Shadow Quality:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Static Reflection Quality:</strong> High</li>



<li><strong>Tessellation:</strong> Near</li>



<li><strong>VSync:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Local Texture Streaming Quality:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Screen Space Reflections:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Screen Space Shadows:</strong> High</li>



<li><strong>Shader Quality:</strong> High</li>



<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1920×1080</li>
</ul>



<p>With the settings above, the game should run quite smoothly. Obviously, some of these settings may vary depending on the hardware you own. It is best to try out different settings yourself to see which works best for you.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-xbox-and-ps5-settings-for-black-ops-6">Best Xbox and PS5 Settings for Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you are playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on a console, you do not need to worry about adjusting settings. Luckily, the game comes automatically adjusted to whatever console you are playing on. </p>



<p>Obviously, a PC will grant you higher FPS, but with the newer hardware in Xbox Series X|S and PS5s, the game will still run smoothly at around 100 FPS. </p>



<p>So, will you be playing Black Ops 6 when it releases on October 25?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-how-alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-update-brings-ray-tracing-to-console.1016598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/heres-how-alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-update-brings-ray-tracing-to-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed the specifics of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, with the studio taking advantage of the increased power of the console to add ray tracing, or increase the general fidelity and performance of other graphics options.</p>
<p>Built using Remedy’s Northlight engine, Alan Wake 2 on PC made good use of ray tracing hardware in Nvidia’s GPUs in particular, layering in a number of different effects to add to the strong lighting and visual style. Xbox Series X|S and PS5 just couldn’t handle them, though, and Remedy instead focussed on the core graphics and other techniques. Now with its own hardware upscaling solution on PS5 Pro – PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) – and the beefier AMD GPU, some of those ray tracing effects can also be brought to console.</p>


<p>As <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-pro---behind-the-scenes">detailed by Remedy,</a> the new PlayStation 5 Pro Quality mode will add ray traced reflections (both opaque and transparent), using an internal render resolution of 2176×1224 and PSSR to upscale that to a full 4K.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro Comparison Video ESRB" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkwWEbk66VI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These specs and performance targets would seemingly put the PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/20/alan-wake-2-pc-requirements-minimum-specs-recommended-ray-tracing-gpu/">between the low and medium performance targets for ray tracing on PC</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro Comparison Video ESRB (Ballroom)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-VXtECHguk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don’t need fancier reflections, then there’s an enhanced Performance mode for PS5 Pro instead. This roughly takes the image quality and render settings of the base PS5 Quality mode, and runs them at 60FPS.</p>
<p>This leans very heavily on the upscaling of PSSR with a render resolution of 1536×864, upscaling all the way to a 4K output, and running at 60FPS. By contrast, Base PS5 Quality mode outputs at an upscaled 1440p and 30FPS.</p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro update won’t matter for a couple weeks, today is a big day for Alan Wake 2 with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/18/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-is-coming-next-week/">The Lake House DLC expansion</a>, and the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/the-anniversary-update-explained/">free Anniversary update</a>. This includes new quality of life and accessibility options. The game now has gyro aiming, inverted X axis options, improved haptics for all healing and throwables on DualSense, and not just guns, and a big suite of optional gameplay assists that contain toggles for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick turn</li>
<li>Auto complete QTE</li>
<li>Button tapping to single tap</li>
<li>Weapon charging with taps</li>
<li>Healing items with taps</li>
<li>Lightshifter with taps</li>
<li>Player invulnerability</li>
<li>Player immortality</li>
<li>One shot kill</li>
<li>Infinite ammo</li>
<li>Infinite flashlight batteries</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed.1016595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, The Sims team revealed a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming Creator Kits made by Myshunosun and Trillyke, two iconic content creators for The Sims 4. The Creator Kits will be available for PC via the EA app, Mac via Origin, Epic Games Store, and Steam. Additionally, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One users will also get to enjoy this new content. When it comes to modding the game or adding custom content to The Sims, this option has only ever been available to players on PC and Mac. However, the Creator Kits come close to what custom content brings to the table.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the Creator Kits, the Sims team released an exclusive look at the Cozy Kitsch and Sweet Slumber Party Creator Kits, which offer players new mid-century modern designs as well as sleepwear and sleepover content for those who like to give their Sims a spruced up bedroom.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-creator-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> released by EA, they state that more details will be released about the Creator Kits as the release date draws closer, and they sat down to interview Myshunosun and Trillyke about the upcoming Creator Kits. This is the first time that The Sims team has collaborated with content creators to create a full collection of in-game assets, which is a huge achievement for those who have been picked to collaborate with The Sims team.</p>
<p>By creating this new form of content, Creators can pitch their ideas to The Sims team and work alongside them to curate a collection, similar to the Storybook Nursery Creator Kit released by Sixam. As stated previously, this is a groundbreaking creation, especially for those on console, as they will finally be able to experience and utilize items created by those who have been modding and creating custom content for years. While it isn't the same as being able to pick and choose your custom content, it's a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>With the new Creator Kits coming out, it's been confirmed by The Sims Team that there will be more of them released in 2025, and they are <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/">planning on expanding the program</a> in the future. The current Creator Kits cost $4.99 to purchase and include items for Create-A-Sim as well as the Build/Buy categories, allowing those who like to play with a theme to create a Kitsch dream of their choice or a sleepy world of their choosing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modern indie horror games owe a lot to kids’ media. If it’s not <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-chapter-2-released-chapter-1-free-forever" rel="noopener" target="_blank">super viral horror sensations being based around cuddly kids characters</a>, it’s a game based around a cute kids' adventure game set on an apple farm. <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is no stranger to that trend, with the original title taking the premise of an old <em>Dora the Explorer</em>-style show hosted by a possibly possessed little girl called Amanda. After the success of the first game, can the sequel continue the story and expand the gameplay?</p>

<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-an-animated-rendition-of-a-public-library.jpg?itok=PJ0LQO89 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-an-animated-rendition-of-a-public-library.jpg?itok=ijki-hpk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The animated cutscenes are sparse but a welcome addition to the game.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is a first-person atmospheric horror puzzle game set in your friendly local library. After escaping the attic location of the previous release, you’re now in a fresh location with another bundle of tapes to watch through. You’ll once again need to deal with the demonic little girl, piece together various clues, and eventually escape from the monster that is haunting you.</p>
<p>If you’re into the theorizing aspect of these games, then you won’t be disappointed either. As you explore your surroundings and watch through the tapes, there are plenty of hints and snatches of information for you to decipher the meta-narrative that ties the whole thing together. If you want. As with many such stories, you’ll get out of it what you put into it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It’s All Available At Your Local Library!</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-with-a-scratchy-kids-tv-show-playing-featuring-a-little-girl-in-a-dark-room-with-a-train.jpg?itok=AR0JDpQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-with-a-scratchy-kids-tv-show-playing-featuring-a-little-girl-in-a-dark-room-with-a-train.jpg?itok=iMwGpJoA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes these tapes end up in pretty dark places.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Amanda The Adventurer</em></a>'s original setting of a spooky attic full of forgotten children’s VHS tapes was a bit more “classic horror”, there’s something more than a little unsettling and liminal about an empty library. Even when starting the game, before anything expressly creepy has even happened, it’s a bit strange to wander around somewhere so quiet when you’re locked in alone at night. Even before Amanda and her low-poly animation starts menacing you on your first VHS tape.</p>
<p>Before you even get started with any of those analog horror shenanigans you have to wrestle with the real core of the game: logic puzzles.</p>
<p>Starting out, you can explore to find a VHS player, but no tapes lying out in the open. You’ll have to unlock the librarian’s cupboard with a 4-digit code to progress and to do that, you’ll have to actually explore and interact with the library to progress further.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Gameplay Loop for the Ages</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-piggy-bank-with-a-digital-display-on-it-near-a-lot-of-library-books-on-a-huge-shelf.jpg?itok=-n4P_W59 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-piggy-bank-with-a-digital-display-on-it-near-a-lot-of-library-books-on-a-huge-shelf.jpg?itok=5QEcOdb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never know how proud of myself I was to get the number to go up to 10.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways, the gameplay loop of <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is very similar to the first game. You have to solve a logic puzzle to either gain a new tape or further the progress on your current tape. Instead of having a few random items in your attic this time, there’s a whole library full of books and constantly changing equipment for you to puzzle your way through, and wow there were a lot of puzzles.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if the volume of puzzles is actually any higher than last time, but they were really satisfying here. Most of them derived from pretty logical starting points, making them enjoyable to solve, even when they were being tougher to piece together. Most of the time, you really just have to rely on good observation skills to gather the information you need to proceed, but there’s also the added bonus of the library’s copy machines acting as hint generators which helped to ease the mental burden at times.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spooky, Scary, Or Spoopy?</h2>

I have to admit that at no point during my playthrough did I feel particularly terrified or inclined to jump out of my skin, but there was plenty of tense atmosphere and creepiness to provide the right atmosphere for this sort of story and general theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, the monster you’re dealing with here isn’t particularly scary, mostly because it spends a lot of the time in this game just standing right out in the open in front of you for extended periods. That said, Amanda herself and some of the contents of the tapes that you end up watching can be downright unsettling, and the VHS effects combined with the old-school TV show animation gives it a little extra dose of immersion to have you on edge.</p>
<h2>Extras, Extras</h2>

There are a lot of fun puzzles and a tense and creepy atmosphere on offer, making this a perfect game for Halloween. More than that, there’s the tangential storyline about what happened to create Amanda, and what exactly the company Hamelin are and where they came from. You can even gain a lot of extra information about the story by finding all of the secrets and revisiting the game after you’re done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a lot of that extra detail is only going to be found if you go digging for it. There’s a fun game to play and if you only want to run through puzzles you can play it and then move on after a handful of hours. If you intend to dig deeper, you could be playing for a long time. Then again, if you’re anything like me, you’ll get stuck on the last puzzle and run up your playtime artificiality while you’re banging your head into a brick wall.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Amanda The Adventurer 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

The plot is bigger, the puzzles are a bit more varied and interesting, and the new setting gives you more room to move around in, literally. The meta-narrative surrounding the Amanda character and what brought her into existence is still interesting, and even those who only stick around for the puzzles will still have an interesting time. Just don’t expect to go to bed with bad dreams unless you get frightened really easily.</p>

For folks like me who haven’t seen the movies, the game doesn’t expect you to have seen past films or fully understand what’s going on in this world. The game explains just enough about what’s happening and provides enough context that I never felt lost.<br></p><p>In <em>The Road Ahead</em> you star as Alex, a young woman with asthma who, in the opening moments, loses her boyfriend to one of the alien monsters after discovering she’s pregnant with his child. This doesn’t help her relationship with her BF’s mom, who already blames her for the death of her husband and becomes disturbingly aggressive when she learns that Alex is carrying the last member of her family. So Alex and her older father escape their clutches, but in doing so get separated—that means an asthmatic, pregnant, and mourning Alex must make her way alone through the alien-infested world to reach some semblance of safety.<br></p><p>I really appreciate that<em> The Road Ahead </em>doesn’t rely solely on the alien monsters to add tension and intrigue to the game. Instead, they act more as an ever-present background threat—similar to how George A. Romero used zombies in his movies—as a small group of people fight for survival while trying to deal with a lot of trauma. But don’t be mistaken, the blind and nearly indestructible aliens are always around and ready to pounce on you if you get too loud or careless.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646">Similar to <em>Alien Isolation</em></a></span>, you aren’t really fighting the monsters in <em>Road Ahead</em>. Instead, 90% of the game is focused on avoiding them by being very quiet and careful. This is done by moving slowly, avoiding surfaces that make a lot of noise—like broken glass or water—using items as distractions and even pouring out sand to create safe paths to walk on, like in the movies. (I’ve seen the trailers!) </p><p>Most of my time was spent carefully tiptoeing around metal cans and piles of leaves. Even opening a door or turning a valve to solve a simple puzzle is nerve-wracking in a universe where one loud squeak or bang can get you killed. The game makes you slowly pull, push, and turn doors, vent openings, valves, dresser drawers, and more using your controller’s analog stick. Make a single mistake, like carelessly trying to run out of a warehouse or fling open a door to safety, and you’ll be attacked and killed in one hit. </p><p>Thankfully, when this happened to me, the game’s checkpoints were frequent enough that I never lost too much progress. Still, whenever I accidentally kicked a can, I froze in real life and hoped the creatures wouldn’t get me.<br></p><p>Alex’s asthma plays a big part in the game and takes the place of a traditional health bar. Because the monsters in<em> A Quiet Place</em> are incredibly lethal and kill you instantly for being too loud, the devs couldn’t use a traditional health meter like in<em> Resident Evil</em> or <em>Silent Hill</em>. Instead, you have to manage your stress and asthma. Running too much or carrying heavy objects for too long will start to strain your lungs, as will getting too close to the monsters, which causes Alex to stress out.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-recommend-id="image://51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-recommend-id="image://51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If Alex pushes herself too far, she can suffer an asthmatic attack, which could get you killed depending on where you are and when it happens. So you need to manage your asthma with inhalers and pills found around the world. I don’t suffer from asthma, so I’m not sure how accurate <em>Road Ahead’</em>s depiction is, but it adds an interesting and tense wrinkle to the game’s most harrowing moments.<br></p><p><em>The Road Ahead </em>isn’t a very long game—most players will be able to finish it in about five to six hours, but that’s perfect. It tells a compelling story that keeps you moving forward and knows when to call it and not stick around too long and run the concept into the ground. Good scary games tend to work better as shorter experiences and the devs behind <em>Road Ahead</em> seem to get this. </p><p>While this new<em> Quiet Place </em>game isn’t the most innovative or scariest game I’ve played, it’s a very well-made and tense adventure that had me more terrified of metal cans and broken glass than any random zombie I’ve encountered in <em>Resident Evil</em>. Who knew trash could be so scary? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike has always been a powerhouse of the esports betting market, but in recent months, it has become a bigger title than ever before in the space. In the Q3 2024 ‘Esports Betting Monitor’ report published by Abios, it was revealed that Counter-Strike 2’s esports betting ecosystem continued to grow, overshadowing every other esports game in the business.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-horizons">New Horizons</h2>



<p>In the report published by Abios and propagated by Cody Luongo’s Sharpr newsletter, it was revealed that Counter-Strike 2 accounted for a whopping 58% of the entire esports betting handle through Q3 2024. That’s an all-time high for 2024, and it’s representative of the growth of Counter-Strike in the world of esports gambling.</p>



<p>Looking at the stack of games, they’re ordered like this when it comes to betting popularity:</p>



<ol>
<li>Counter-Strike</li>



<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>



<li>Valorant</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>
</ol>



<p>In the last quarter, the most bet-on events included the ESL Pro League, BLAST Premier, and IEM – all Counter-Strike events. League of Legends tournaments weren’t too far behind, though – the LPL, LCK, and LEC all did strong numbers in terms of esports wagering.</p>



<p>It has been a stellar year for League of Legends in general. It was just days ago that <a href="https://escharts.com/news/worlds-series-one-billion-hours-watched" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports Charts reported</a> the League of Legends World Championship had hit <strong>one billion </strong>hours of watch time since records began.</p>



<p>Esports betting continues to be dramatically lucrative for the wider industry. It makes up more than half of the market’s revenue and it contributes to some of the most prolific partnerships and sponsorship deals irrespective of the game in question.</p>

<h2 id="h-assault-rifles">Assault Rifles</h2>



<p>The most versatile guns are Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6, as they have the ability to perform at all ranges.

They’re best used at medium-to-long ranges, with easy-to-control recoil and great damage.</p>

It’s an action-RPG based on Chinese mythology and the story <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/knowing-this-lore-makes-black-myth-wukong-way-more-enjoyable">Journey to the West</a>.</p><p>In his 8/10 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>, critic <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/Mitchell-IGN">Mitchel Saltzman</a> wrote:</p><p>“As GameScience’s debut action game, Black Myth: Wukong is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears. Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making Black Myth: Wukong a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs.”</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukongs-physical-ps5-edition-is-up-for-preorder">Black Myth: Wukong (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-pc">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-xbox-series-x-s-pc">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

The feat is a world's first.</p><p>Having just one hit point is an obvious threat, as it means any hit taken, even from the most insignificant enemy or fall, results in death, But having just one focus point, or FP, meant Ainrun couldn't use any magic or Ash of War skills that allow the myriad speedrunning and cheesing strategies deployable in normal runs.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">20+ hours, 900+ deaths on Radahn. World's first 1HP/1FP/1Stam run is finally over. <a href="https://t.co/GFoCFnParw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GFoCFnParw</a></p>— Ainrun (@Ainrun) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ainrun/status/1848393882960040165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But it was the one point of stamina that caused the most problems, they said. Elden Ring, like FromSoftware's previous games, uses stamina for everything. Every use of the shield to defend against attacks, every swing of the player's own weapon, and every dodge out of the way uses stamina. Having just one point of it meant none of those things could be used together.</p><p>"The one HP didn't matter much cause I'm used to no hit runs," Ainrun said in a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/Ainrun/status/1848394358933827842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. "The one stamina was the worst part. You cant chain actions like spam rolls or do combos, cause every action takes stamina and goes to the negative.</p><p>"You need to wait a whole second for your stamina to go back to the positive before you can do another action. The one FP meant I couldn't cheese bosses or use Ash of Wars or anything. Just pure movement and parries and self-hate."</p><p>The feat is made all the more impressive given just how hard many players found Shadow of the Erdtree normally. It featured bosses with which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-has-pushed-the-envelope-on-what-can-be-withstood-by-players-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">FromSoftware "really pushed the envelope" on what the player can withstand</a>, director Hidetaka Miyazaki said ahead of its release. In fact, getting into the expansion even poses a challenge as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">players must defeat an optional boss</a>.</p><p>Those eager to explore every inch of the DLC once in can check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">IGN's extensive guide</a>, which covers <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">Shadow of the Erdtree's new weapons</a>, its various quest lines, and how to defeat those pesky new bosses.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">In our 10/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said. "It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been looking for a way to jump into Delta Force, the game will be getting a PC Open Beta Test on December 5, 2024.&nbsp; The game was well received during Steam Next Fest, and Team Jade has announced that the tactical shooter will be launching its PC Open Beta Test on December 5. To celebrate the release of the Global PC Open Beta, Team Jade has released a Cinematic Trailer, where you can watch just over four minutes of content to get excited about the title.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force | PC Global Open Beta Cinematic Trailer: Genesis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YY6mxdHdHNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PC Open Beta Test, previously known as Early Access, will bring expanded content to the game, allowing players to experiment with new weapons and operators, as well as new maps, missions, and much more. As the game was so well received during Steam Next Fest, Shadow Guo, Game Director of Delta Force, made a statement about what's next for the title.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to wrap up Steam Next Fest with a bang! On behalf of the entire team, we want to say a huge thank you! Given the feedback and the game's current state on PC, we've decided to release the multiplayer component for PC players ahead of schedule. We're excited to bring a plethora of new content to players, and we hope they enjoy every moment."</p>
<p>While this is an exciting moment for PC players, those on console and mobile will have to wait a little while longer, with Shadow Guo saying that news will be coming early next year. Delta Force is shaping up to be a highly anticipated game, as the title has reached over two million wishlists on Steam alone, making it the 4th <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-reaches-one-million-steam-wishlists/">most wishlisted title</a> on the platform currently. In addition to that, Delta Force topped all three of the official Steam Next Fest charts, with the game being in the top spot on the Trending Upcoming, Popular Upcoming, and Top Demos title lists.</p>
<p>The single-player campaign for Delta Force doesn't have an official release date yet, but it's probable that it will be released sometime during 2025, as that was originally when the multiplayer mode of Delta Force was going to be released.</p>
<p>This is a huge accomplishment for<a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Team Jade</a>, as they previously worked on games such as Call of Duty: Mobile and Assault Fire. Assault Fire has been the most popular Chinese shooter game on PC for the past decade. Delta Force is a major franchise, with the first game being released in 1998.&nbsp; The last title was released in 2009, with the upcoming Delta Force title coming to PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, and Android.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-black-ops-6-campaign/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the last few years, Call of Duty’s campaigns have been woefully short. In 2023, Modern Warfare III was released with a story mode that could be completed in just <strong>three hours</strong>, which always leaves users feeling short-changed. With that in mind, many people are asking the obvious question: ‘How long is the Black Ops 6 campaign?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-black-ops-6">How Long is Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Let’s be honest, everyone cares about multiplayer when it comes to Call of Duty, and <strong>that’s </strong>endless. This time around there’s also a stacked COD Zombies offering, which only serves to increase the number of hours you’ll spend shooting things and exploring this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>But what about the campaign? How long is Black Ops 6’s story?</p>



<p>Here’s what we know.</p>



<p>Treyarch explained that the Black Ops 6 campaign is a) ‘the kind of length of a classic Call of Duty campaign’, and b) ‘slightly longer than Cold War (2020).’</p>



<p>When it was released, Black Ops Cold War boasted one of the shortest Call of Duty campaigns ever, coming in at around five hours. With that in mind, it seems obvious that Black Ops 6 will have a <strong>longer </strong>story for players to explore.</p>







<p>In terms of the average, it’s usually expected that a standard COD campaign will take players around 6 – 7 hours to finish, but it has been wildly varied in recent years.</p>



<p>There are a few things that might make the Black Ops 6 campaign length seem a little shorter. For instance, the game only has one linear ending, and there’s nothing to gain from replaying it to find alternate endings. </p>



<p>Also, this game is more accessible than ever, and the easiest difficulty setting and all the guidance options are expected to make this game <strong>a breeze </strong>unless you’re playing on a harder difficulty setting.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25 – we’ll have confirmation then of how long the campaign is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/10/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-boss-reveal-trailer-details<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Additionally, over on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/22/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-first-look-at-bosses-new-map-details/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>, Aspyr associate brand manager Matthew Ray as shared further details on the bosses and new map system:</p><div><p><strong>■ Remastered Boss Updates and Reveals</strong></p><p>Each boss encounter in <em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</em> is designed to challenge the player’s mastery of Raziel’s abilities. Our goal with the character models was to improve the textures as much as we could while ensuring that they blend in with the apocalyptic world. </p><p><strong>Melchiah</strong></p><p>The first of Kain’s lieutenants Raziel must defeat. This battle takes place in the Necropolis where Melchiah chases Raziel down while phasing through gates, making the spectral realm no longer safe. Strategically use the environment to expose Melchiah’s vulnerabilities and use his own devices against him.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—Melchiah received a full texture overhaul with darkened skin and a slimier body-feel. The bones and skeletal mapping are now more realistic and gory and his eye color was adjusted to match the original look.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Zephon</strong></p><p>Fought in a dilapidated cathedral, Zephon has evolved into an insect-like creature, fusing with this towering structure. You’ll need to ascend to the highest chambers and become willingly ensnared to be able to confront him. Search the room for any elemental advantages which could aid you in this endeavor.</p><p><em>—Zephon was too desaturated, so we’ve completely repainted his face.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Rahab</strong></p><p>This battle occurs in a flooded abbey. Rahab is fully immune to water, which is lethal to Raziel. Use Raziel’s agility to avoid Rahab’s deadly close-range and long-range attacks by jumping and make use of your newly gained Telekinetic projectile ability to exploit Rahab’s extreme vulnerability to sunlight.</p><p><em>—Rahab’s head has been remodeled, so the eyes now have a reddish glow which gives him a menacing look. We’ve also altered the fangs to look more vampiric and made his skin color a little more gray.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Dumah</strong></p><p>In a desolated fortress, Dumah awaits reanimation. Just like his other brethren, Dumah is invulnerable to any attacks, so Raziel has to be cunning and lure him to a flame powerful enough to melt even the hardest metal, all while avoiding tremendous earthquakes caused by Dumah’s incredible strength.</p><p><em>—Dumah’s armor is now a lot dirtier and has patches of mold and blood all over it (considering he was impaled for centuries).</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Kain</strong></p><p>Raziel first confronts Kain at the Pillars where he must be swift and strike Kain three times to gain the Soul Reaver. The second encounter takes place in the Chronoplast, where the tiered arena makes evasion even more challenging. Track your target’s movements closely and make haste to strike him with the Soul Reaver. If you cannot reach him in time, use your Telekinetic projectile to stop Kain from using his powerful lightning attack. The encounter is intense and dramatic, but we won’t spoil how it concludes. Pre-order to find out!</p><p><em>—The models for Kain in both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 needed to be completely re-designed to mitigate textural issues. With the increased polygon count we felt it was important to bring his look a lot closer to the Kain we got to see in the original <a title="Genres > FMV [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/fmv">FMV</a>s, which was a lot more detailed and showed more-or-less what the original intent was for the character. The original model in SR1 was especially limited so now both games have a Kain that looks consistent between the two titles.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Map and Compass Details and Gameplay</strong></p><p>In the original versions of the games, players often found themselves wandering the vast, twisting landscapes of Nosgoth, relying heavily on memory and environmental cues to navigate.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>The introduction of the Map and Compass marks a thoughtful enhancement that blends modern gameplay conveniences with the preservation of the explorative experience the original titles were known for. The Compass gently nudges the player in the right direction without giving away specific details of where to go or what to do next and the Map is more of a reference tool than a guide.</p><p>We also included a collection tracker for any Health and Energy power-ups so that you know if you’ve gotten all of the collectibles within each area. All of the major Nosgoth features are present and accurately condensed based on the setting and gameplay. </p><p>For fans who might feel that these additions are a major departure from the original games, we’ve made sure to incorporate a toggle-off function for the compass. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to its gameplay utility, the map is also a wonderful art piece that was created in collaboration with our development team, community advisors, artists, and designers at <a title="Companies > Crystal Dynamics [150 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cde-entertainment/crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a>. We knew accuracy was paramount, so we worked hard to pull from the original source art, design documents, and clues from game lore. We also incorporated community reviews to ensure nothing had been missed.</p><p>Thanks to these efforts, the map is accurate enough to feature in the new lore reader bonus menu – identifying the location of each lore entry. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>For design direction, Crystal Dynamics designers used a heavily inked approach that sits beautifully with the existing art, creating a stunning new way to visualize the world of Nosgoth. </p><p>The Map and Compass are there to serve as welcome tools for exploration, ensuring that the remastered versions remain both a tribute to the classics and a modernized, more player-friendly experience.</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was an early success for Ubisoft in 2024, or so it seemed anyway. It was the first relatively big game to launch this year and it got rave reviews, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco's 9/10 on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action game features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, sales haven't been nearly as positive, at least compared to Ubisoft's pre-release estimates. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to YouTuber Gautoz</a>, who talked to various members of the Montpellier office, there won't be any sequel and the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team is also practically disbanded.</p>
<p><em>You have to understand that internally, the writing was on the wall a few weeks after the game launched at the beginning of the year. By Spring, it was pretty clear – just a few patches, a DLC, and that was it. The more optimistic folks in the core team repeatedly pitched a sequel project, but then it turned into a struggle to get the green light for two DLCs, hoping to change the bosses' minds. But it was obvious that the decision had been made quickly, especially with the need for help on other projects with better sales potential.</em></p>
<p><em>Ubisoft usually has a sales curve like a blockbuster—big launch, but this time, it started lower than expected. I've heard a justification that honestly drives me crazy as a gamer: if you let them make another one, it’ll eat into the long-term sales of this one. I've always thought the opposite; with a good sale on the first one, you could actually boost sales.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The production of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown wasn't exactly an issue—far from it, actually. For instance, there was crunch, but we're talking about a production with a really strong collective spirit, which is pretty different from how Ubisoft usually makes games with 80 to 100 people fully loaded on development, which is pretty small in comparison.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a classic big Ubisoft project, but it was a blessing to try out different organizational models. Some teams, like the gameplay team for example, were set up almost horizontally with a lot of listening and consultation. People felt like they really had a say in the project's direction. Plus, it's worth mentioning that the Prince of Persia team had often allowed people who were totally burned out due to too much time spent on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Somewhere along the way, it also helped some people get back on their feet after tough times in their careers. So these days, the big office reorganization at Ubisoft Montpellier is kind of wiping away the last traces of that team.</em></p>
<p>It is unfortunate since Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is arguably one of the very few critical successes enjoyed by Ubisoft lately. However, the company is now focused entirely on improving its sales, and it was even willing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows out of its scheduled November 2024 release window to avoid jeopardizing its signature franchise. They're also backing out of the Season Pass model, canceling early access, and returning to Steam in three unprecedented pro-consumer moves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-new-and-improved-wireless-headset/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the new Xbox Wireless Headset was announced. This headset features the same sleek and classic look as the original Xbox Wireless Headset but comes with some new enhancements to make the headset better and provide a more immersive and seamless experience for those who want that surround sound feeling. For those who are interested in picking up the headset, you can purchase it for $109.99, with this new version of the headset officially replacing the original model. The headset is available for purchase now.</p>
<p>To make sure that players are getting the most immersive gaming experience with this new headset, players will be able to use Dolby Atmos for immersive, spatial audio at no additional cost. Compared to the previous headset, the battery life has now been improved and offers players up to 20 hours of playtime. Additionally, the microphone for the Xbox Wireless Headset has been improved, offering a new enhanced auto-mute and voice isolation system featuring Bluetooth 5.3. The Xbox Wireless Headset is available in all-black, with no current plans to create the headset in other colors.</p>
<p>If Dolby Atmos isn't your style, the Xbox Wireless Headset also comes with built-in support for Windows Sonic and DTS Headphone: X. For those who like to be able to hear every single detail during their gaming experience, this is the perfect audio combination. Just in time for October, the month when everyone is braving some new horror games.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't planning on using this headset for the Xbox, it has Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity for both PC and mobile devices, which means that players using this headset will be able to switch between devices without any issue, and there won't be endless fiddling around with the Bluetooth settings to try and get your devices to sync up. Additionally, there are no dongles or extra pieces of equipment that you'll need to use in order to get your headset working.</p>
<p>The Xbox Wireless Headset comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-suggests-samsung-and-google-are-developing-a-pair-of-mixed-reality-smart-glasses-instead-of-a-headset/">Qualcomm</a> S5 Gen 2 technology, providing a low-latency wireless connection, allowing for smooth gameplay and perfect communications between teammates.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/22/xbox-wireless-headset-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a> for the Xbox Wireless headset, it is noted that for those wanting to use DTS Headphone: X, you may have to purchase additional content and apps to be able to use it. Additionally, the battery life of the headset depends on a number of factors, including the distance from the console, additional accessories, usage, and more.</p>

<p>The Wolf Among Us 2 has not been cancelled at Telltale Games. </p>



<p>The confirmation comes after rumors began to circulate over the last 24 hours that the game was almost to a point where Telltale “might have no choice but to shelve it”.</p>



<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-not-cancelled-telltale-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Telltale Games assured fans that the game was still moving forward with development.</p>



<p>As a rule, we don’t comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads,” the Telltale rep told the outlet. “But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we’re excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The original poster of the rumor has since deleted the claim.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2017, The Wolf Among Us 2 was first cancelled when Telltale Games had to shut down in 2018. Upon the studio’s revival in 2019, the game’s development was restarted. It was planned for a release in 2023, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-out-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed due to development</a> “requiring more time”. Since then, it’s been silent on when the game could come.</p>



<p>The studio did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/telltale-games-allegedly-fires-most-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff a significant number</a> of people in 2023, however, according to former cinematic artist Jonah Huang.</p>



<p>What do you think of the state of The Wolf Among Us 2 amid cancellation rumors? Let us know in the comments or the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

Throne and Liberty, recently published globally by Amazon Games <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-hails-success-of-mmo-throne-and-liberty-after-3-million-players-in-a-week">to huge player numbers on Steam</a>, is now its own game studio.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/tl-1729612090545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Throne and Liberty's global launch is a success, Amazon Games has said.</figcaption></figure></output><p>NCSoft is now split into four divisions: NCAI, Studio X, Studio Y, and Studio G. (Studio X is the studio behind Throne and Liberty.) It’s unclear at this stage what NCSoft’s troubles mean for ArenaNet, the Bellevue, Washington-based studio behind Guild Wars. Earlier this year, Guild Wars 3 was said to have been in development, although work continues on Guild Wars 2.</p><p>Some video games will be canceled, howoever, alongside layoffs via a voluntary retirement program, the co-CEOs confirmed. "Major changes are inevitable for the survival and future of the company, and we promise active support and compensation to those affected,” they said.</p><p>Earlier this month, Amazon Games announced that Throne and Liberty had seen more than three million players in just a week following its global launch. Originally billed as a Lineage sequel, Throne and Liberty is an MMO with PvE and PvP set in a dynamic and seamless world. It suffered numerous delays over the course of a development cycle spanning several years.</p><p>Throne and Liberty finally launched on October 1 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and soon proved a hit on Steam with an impressive player concurrent peak of 336,300.
