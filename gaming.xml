            <p>If you've yet to play any of the Dragon Age games, but Dragon Age: Veilguard's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKsoC12JCY">recent gameplay video</a> piqued your interest, I have good news. You can currently scoop up the first three games for less than £10 thanks to a new Steam deal.</p>
<p>For a total of £8.47, you can purchase Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Dragon Age Inquisition - with all the major DLC and expansions for each included.</p>
<p>EA's Dragon Age promotion is running until 27th of June, and you'll <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/DragonAgeFranchiseSale">find the sales page here</a> if you fancy something to do this weekend that isn't Elden Ring.</p>

<p>As for what's next, that'll be The Veilguard, which arrives at some point later this year. In the time since its reveal earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ages-original-creator-david-gaider-praises-the-veilguard-reveal">Dragon Age's original creator David Gaider has praised the upcoming release</a>, particularly its atmospheric dark- and magic-infused city of Minrathous. "I'm just eager to see where this goes," he wrote. "To the folks at Bio: great job."️ Gaider <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creator-says-veilguards-approach-to-romance-isnt-a-huge-surprise-following-baldurs-gate-3">also shared his thoughts on The Veilguard's romance options</a>, comparing it to Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>For more, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently went hands-on with BioWare's new game and was rather taken with it. "Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">his preview</a>.</p>

            <p>After years of anticipation, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>’s first - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-more-elden-ring-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree-says-souls-boss-miyazaki">and only</a> - expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is finally out as of today. While there are plenty of intriguing secrets hiding in the new corner (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">it’s a big corner</a>) of the Lands Between, Steam Deck players might stumble upon a not-so-welcome new discovery too, courtesy of a bug that can make your game unresponsive.</p>

</div>
<p>The issue stems from Elden Ring’s 1.12 patch, which was released yesterday in the lead-up to Shadow of the Erdtree’s launch. As well as adding support for the expansion itself and some general tweaks and balances, the latest update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-youre-waiting-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring-has-some-free-hair-for-you">introduced some fresh haircuts</a>, a handy new ‘Recent Items’ tab in your inventory and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-yak-thanks-to-elden-rings-latest-update-you-can-finally-summon-torrent-during-the-final-bossfight">fairly major change to the game’s final boss fight</a>, which now lets you summon your trusty ghost horse Torrent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, along with those lovely new features came an unexpected bug on the Steam Deck confirmed by Elden Ring’s official TwiXer account. The bug appears to affect the game as a whole - meaning it doesn’t matter whether you’re playing the base Elden Ring or Shadow of the Erdtree - and essentially leaves the game inoperable by refusing to accept inputs if the Steam Deck is left inactive for longer than five minutes while playing.</p>
<p>That doesn’t seem all that unlikely to happen if you’re, say, waiting on a summon before tackling a difficult boss or even if you just squat down at a site of grace while you go and make a cuppa. Elden Ring’s diligent auto-saving and the suggestion you’d have to be somewhere in the game where you’re not doing anything anyway means you’re perhaps unlikely to lose much progress unless you’re especially unfortunate (or you get invaded), but having to reboot the game if you leave it a few seconds too long is a faff regardless.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Note: a Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on.</p><p>Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs.</p><p>We apologize for inconvenience.</p><p>The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately.</p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The good news is that FromSoftware are on it, confirming that they’re working on a hotfix to squish the irritating bug. The middling news is that they can’t confirm a time or date for when that fix will arrive just yet, so you’ll just need to tend to your Steam Deck a little more closely than usual in the meantime.</p>
<p>While certainly not a dealbreaker, the extra bit of grit is more noticeable given Elden Ring’s otherwise wonderfully smooth showing on the Deck, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-steam-deck-performance-best-settings">James found to continue in Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. There have been some reports of a separate error message flagging a warning of “Inappropriate activity detected” and blocking online play, too, though From are yet to confirm the cause or solution for that problem.</p>

  <p id="1A0wgr">It’s time to return to Tilted Towers. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em> </em>is getting a surprise update this weekend. It’s called “Reload” and it’ll launch on Saturday, the official <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1804182998579056649">Fortnite account said on X</a>. A teaser trailer revealed it this update will introduce a new map and mode to <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
<p id="XK3oK7">You can view the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1804182711902314775">full teaser on the official Fortnite X account</a>. Longer-time players might recognize the map has classic locations from previous versions of the game like Tilted Towers, Retail Row, and more. Other than that, we don’t have a lot of details on the update. However, the map looks a bit smaller than your average <em>Fortnite </em>map, so players will have to see how that will impact this new way to play. </p>

<p id="l2hAhN"><em>Fortnite </em>is currently in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/24163821/chapter-5-season-3-battle-pass-skins-list-c5s3-t60-power-armor-fallout">Chapter 5 Season 3</a>. The current version of the game, called “Wrecked,” has players duke it out in a desert wasteland inspired by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout">Fallout</a> and features the metal band Metallica. At the moment, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked">game is going full Mad Max</a> and allows players to fight with a variety of tricked out war vehicles and more. It’s a rather chaotic way to play and has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1czzwls/chapter_5_season_3_review/">inspired criticism from players</a>. Now, it’s looking like fans will be able to try their hand at a new play mode. </p>

Emongg handled tanks, Custa and TQQ divided damage heroes by projectile and hitscan kits, and Eskay rounded things out for support heroes. The mode is available to play from June 20 to July 8, and while Blizzard describes it as “wacky” and “chaotic,” some of the changes are a net gain for their respective heroes.</p><p>Some of the changes, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dkovrn/all_community_crafted_abilities/?share_id=BHHYVqo6Ca5iuMWh9_eNQ&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dkovrn/all_community_crafted_abilities/?share_id=BHHYVqo6Ca5iuMWh9_eNQ&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laid out here on the <em>Overwatch </em>subreddit</a></span>, are shifting numbers around like increasing or decreasing damage output, but a fair amount of them completely change the utility for characters. Orisa gets back her crowd control Halt ability from the original <em>Overwatch</em>, Mei gets some increased mobility when she sprays the ground with her cryo weapon like she’s skating on the ice, and Mercy’s revive now only brings an ally back for a limited time. Some of these are silly, but hidden between the excess are some pretty solid ideas.</p><p>One of the standouts is Eskay’s take on Brigitte which specifically affects her Inspire ability, a passive healing ability triggered when she does damage to an enemy. So if she’s swinging her flail or hitting a foe with her shield, she will heal her teammates if they’re within a certain range of her. However, Inspire has always been a pretty difficult ability to read on the field. A yellow pulse emits from Brigitte when Inspire is proc’d, but the actual effect extends much further than the visual indicator and lasts longer than when it appears. Some people don’t even realize Brig can heal this way because it’s so discreet. To help with this, Eskay had Blizzard add an icon that shows Brigitte’s portrait next to an ally’s health bar on their HUD similar to how Mercy’s does when she’s actively healing you with her staff. This way, Brig’s teammates can tell when they’re in range of healing and comfortably help her push through enemy forces. It’s such a good quality-of-life change that I’d be surprised if Blizzard doesn’t implement it in a future patch, and fans seem to agree.</p><p>“Eskay needs to be a dev on the balance team,” @mysticscouter said on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@niandra_ow/video/7382659698677353760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@niandra_ow/video/7382659698677353760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></span>. @Hogonetrick said on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQi-f1VNucc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQi-f1VNucc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span>, “That Inspire life change should be in the [actual] game [rather] than a fun game mode.”</p><p>“Some are wild and wacky while others I think were genuine nudges in what they think would be good for the hero.

One good teaser. And that’s exactly how I discovered <em>Blud</em>, a newly released 2D <em>Zelda</em>-like action game about vampires, evil tech bros, and high school. I saw its release trailer on Twitter, thought “Wow that looks cool!” and started playing it. The game, with its bold colors, thick lines, and odd shapes, looks like a cartoon from the ‘90s or early 2000s. But while its impressive style caught my eye and got me playing <em>Blud</em>, I’m happy to report the rest of this playable cartoon is also pretty dang awesome, too.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195755" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="181" data-playlist="195755,196907,191425" data-current="195755"><div><p>The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21265.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.exit73studios.com/portfolio_page/blud/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.exit73studios.com/portfolio_page/blud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blud </em>started life as a pitch for an animated series</a></span> from studio Exit 73 about a young girl who, after being trained by a mystical master, fights evil vampires and other nasty demonic critters while balancing high school, friends, social media, and the rest of her life in a small town.

I think one of <em>Blud’s </em>strongest features is its distinct and eye-catching art style. Levels look like hand-painted backgrounds from shows like <em>Dexter’s Lab </em>and <em>The Powerpuff Girls.</em> Characters and enemies are designed using weird shapes and exaggerated proportions, almost like they fell out of an episode of <em>The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy</em>. And all of these characters and baddies animate like cartoon characters, with their legs and feet stretching or changing shape to emphasize movement and impact.<br></p><p>In motion, <em>Blud </em>is one of the coolest-looking games I’ve ever played, perfectly recreating (and modernizing) that old late ‘90s animated look and feel in a way I’ve never seen before in a video game.<br></p><h2 id="h127715"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s not reanimating the wheel</strong></h2><p>As for the rest of the game, it’s not quite as perfect as <em>Blud’s </em>visuals, but it’s still enjoyable. Playing as the vampire slayer Becky, you run to various locations around town—your high school, a spooky cemetery, a large hospital, and the local mall—completing small quests which usually involve fighting different types of vampires and demonic creatures.<br></p><p>At first, the game’s combat is very simple. But quickly, as you get more options and a badass field hockey stick, <em>Blud’s </em>combat becomes more interesting, forcing you to block some attacks while dodging others. You also have to use objects like a shovel and an umbrella to solve simple puzzles or defeat challenging bosses, each with a gimmick to solve.</p><p>If you’ve played video games in the last decade or so, nothing here will seem revolutionary or incredibly innovative. It plays a lot like a top-down <em>Zelda</em>-like action game, complete with walls that use cracks to indicate where you can drop a bomb (in this case a firework) to blow open a hole and find a secret. It’s not bad, it’s just a bit by the numbers. However, the art style and visuals—including some gorgeously animated cutscenes—help elevate <em>Blud </em>and make it something special.<br></p><h2 id="h127716"><a id=""></a><strong>Cartoony jank</strong></h2><p>One word of warning: Some of the boss fights in this game are a bit annoying and might cause you to stop playing. This is often due to the game’s awesome animations, which while cool to look at, can sometimes make it hard to know exactly what to do or where to stand to avoid an attack.</p><p>This can also be a problem during combat outside of boss fights, where I sometimes took damage because an extended animation left me a sitting duck for an enemy. After a bit of time with <em>Blud</em>, I acclimated to its combat flow and peculiarities, but it does sometimes feel like <em>Blud </em>cares more about looking awesome than playing perfectly, which can be annoying.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="3965d122a438f17026038a3249b038bf" data-recommend-id="image://3965d122a438f17026038a3249b038bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a large vampire yelling at a small kid.

So I didn’t mind kicking the bucket because a fire vampire burned me alive as I was grabbing something or a tiny vampire creature could get me with its spear tongue through a wall. It all looked so nice!<br></p><p><em>Blud </em>may not play perfectly, but this seven-hour vampire-killing adventure is such a visual treat that I rarely cared when a boss crushed me or the menu bugged out and I had to reload it. If you can put up with a bit of jank, <em>Blud </em>is worth playing on a big TV screen with some friends, preferably folks who grew up loving late ‘90s animated cartoons. Just be prepared for people going “Oh wow!” a lot as you run around town and save the world with a pink field hockey stick.<br></p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you weren’t aware, the world has gone quiet. Everyone, from teachers to doctors to students, sits quietly at their gaming setups, toiling away in Shadow of the Erdtree. It’s the most significant expansion launch of all time, surpassing the impressive score of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Blood and Wine DLC. But does Shadow of the Erdtree have achievements for you to strive toward?</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-shadow-of-the-erdtree-achievements">Are There Shadow of the Erdtree Achievements?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there are no achievements in Shadow of the Erdtree. While the base game features more than 40 achievements/trophies to unlock, the expansion, which will take up to 30 hours to complete, doesn’t offer a single one.</p>



<p>Instead, if you’d like to capture your achievements in-game, take a screenshot and share it with the world. It’s a small concession, as I know many of us would enjoy having an actual achievement or trophy tied to particularly tough bosses, but it’s unlikely to happen post-release. Never say never, though!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-beat-mohg-and-start-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-beat-mohg-and-start-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Beat Mohg and Start Shadow of the Erdtree</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-who-is-the-hardest-boss-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Who is the Hardest Boss in Shadow of the Erdtree?</h2>



<p>You will face countless challenging bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree. They’re some of the most difficult in the entire game, with the difficulty ramping up significantly the moment you enter the new zone. Even if you’re level 150 or higher, you’ll find yourself getting crushed by many of the new bosses and, sometimes, even the mobs.</p>



<p>But to answer the question of who the hardest boss in Shadow of the Erdtree is, it is by far Radanh, Consort of Miquella. He’s the expansion’s final boss and, as such, the most difficult in the entire area.</p>



<p>I genuinely thought it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-messmer-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Messmer the Impaler</a>. After all, he’s the poster child for the expansion. While he’s demanding, he’s not the toughest of them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There’s a rather sad perception in the world at large that board games are for kids, things we should put away when we grow up. Not only does it seem a bit forlorn that we can’t enjoy silly things as we get older, there’s a very wide range of board games that, for the most part, aren’t silly at all. They’re engrossing, rich and demanding of your strategic skills, taking many plays to understand and master, rivalling the depth of centuries-old <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games"><u>classic board games</u></a> like Chess and Go.  </p><p>So here’s our voyage across the world of grown-up board games, picking out the very best for your gaming table. It spans everything from fantasy and sci-fi to ecological and social themes, and takes in everything in between. There’s sure to be something here that piques your interest, and whatever you pick, it’ll reward the time you put into it handsomely over and over again.</p><h3>TLDR: Best Board Games for Adults</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dPDqK" target="_blank">Clank! Catacombs</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MV8W1" target="_blank">Sand</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/PyVZy" target="_blank">Cascadero</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/BZyPM" target="_blank">Hegemony</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/bL78E" target="_blank">Wingspan</a> / <a href="https://zdcs.link/KK3Ay" target="_blank">Wyrmspan</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MjN21" target="_blank">Darwin's Journey</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KjPv3" target="_blank">Spirit Island</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/57RrY" target="_blank">Brian Boru</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/qV657" target="_blank">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/RVgAV" target="_blank">Frosthaven</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/6wMEq" target="_blank">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/q7DG3" target="_blank">Ready Set Bet</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/YlPex" target="_blank">Terraforming Mars</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/AMP35" target="_blank">Root</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/nerBl" target="_blank">Mind MGMT</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/84grL" target="_blank">Anachrony</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3qAxM" target="_blank">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</a></li></ul><h2>Clank! Catacombs</h2><div id="196157"><p><h3>Clank! Catacombs</h3></p></div><p>Gamers have spent years waiting for the perfect dungeon-delving board game, but all the candidates tended to either run too long or rely too much on luck. This latest evolution of the popular Clank franchise, where you select cards for a deck that helps you creep through a dungeon to loot treasure without alerting a sleeping dragon, has hit the sweet spot. It enlivened the deck-building aspect with more control, letting you fine-tune your selection for more strategy, while adding a tile-based variable layout to the dungeon itself for tons of variety and replay value. And the sneaking mechanic remains as tense as ever as you draw cubes from the bag, praying not to trigger a dragon attack or swarm of ghosts.</p><h2>Sand</h2><div id="202259"><p><h3>Sand</h3></p></div><p>Pick up and deliver games, where you cart goods from one location to another and turn them in for victory points or profit, are an old and slightly neglected genre. Sand brings it bang up to date by imposing an engaging theme and a brain-burning puzzle on top of the traditional fare. Players are merchants who must traverse a fantasy desert by worm-back, starting with basic goods and hopefully trading or upgrading their way to more precious commodities, with each town in the random layout accepting and giving different types of resource. But there’s a catch: the more you carry, the less you can do, leaving you in a constant bind as to how best to balance the two. As you grow wealthier, you can choose from a variety of upgrades and acolytes to help you carry more, but they all come with their own strategic baggage to enrich the challenge as well as your merchant.</p><h2>Cascadero</h2><div id="202260"><p><h3>Cascadero</h3></p></div><p>Reiner Knizia, the brains behind Cascadero, is a hugely acclaimed and prolific board game designer, renowned for his skill at creating exciting, interactive games that boast both easy rules and strategic depth. He’s hit top form again with this peculiar game about placing messengers next to towns. Ignore the theme: it’s really just an excuse for a cunning setup where everyone wants to be the second person to play next to a town on a tight board, meaning almost every play opens an infuriating opportunity for someone else to benefit, and it’s down to you to work out how to advance your own plans without giving a bit boost to an opponent. But watch out, as the chain-based scoring system, which can lead to one move having a sudden cascade of after-effects, can trip you up if you don’t consider every element of the play carefully before picking your move. </p><h2>Hegemony</h2><div id="196158"><p><h3>Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory</h3></p></div><p>You can’t fault Hegemony for its ambition. It puts each player into the role of the social strata of a country: the working, middle and capitalist classes plus the state itself. Each has its own set of cards, spaces on the board and actions to take that fit into the overall framework of play. At the same time, each class has its own goals, which often involve advancing its own interests against those of other factions, setting up a fascinating balance whereby everyone contributes to keeping things on the rails while trying to inch ahead in the overall stakes. Much like a real society, in fact, even if it is a very simplified model. Between its open social commentary and its intricate strategies, Hegemony has what it takes to keep you hooked for game after game. </p><h2>Wingspan / Wyrmspan</h2><div id="199023"><p><h3>Wyrmspan</h3></p></div><div id="155272"><p><h3>Wingspan</h3></p></div><p>There’s no better place to start this list than with one of the most popular and engaging games of the last few years. Wingspan is often sold as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> but in truth, it’s a little too complex and challenging for kids. It is pitch-perfect for adults, though, with a perfect weave of tactics and strategy together with a winning theme as you try to attract birds to a nature reserve. Different birds need different foods and habitats but will contribute to your growing ecosystem which becomes a kind of engine, generating resources to allow you to play bigger and more beautiful birds. And if you want an even bigger challenge - in every sense of the word - try Wyrmspan, a successor title that enriches the mechanics for deeper strategies and swaps birds for dragons.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review"><em>review of Wingspan</em></a><em>, and our review of </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">Wyrmspan</a><em>.</em></p><h2>Darwin’s Journey</h2><div id="196159"><p><h3>Darwin's Journey</h3></p></div><p>At first, Darwin’s Journey looks like a pretty typical worker placement game. But it has several twists that help it rise to the top of that well-stacked genre. First, the theme is engaging and educational. Second, it’s an excellent example of its type, full of deep, interlocking concepts that span across spatial and economic strategy and reward well-considered strategies. Finally, it offers the novel concept of worker specialisations: some of your pieces - representing crew on your scientific voyage - are better at some actions than others, and you can upgrade their skills as the game progresses.</p><h2>Spirit Island</h2><div id="155274"><p><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p>A lot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board games</a> are very family-friendly, but Spirit Island is different. It’s deep and demanding, for one thing, with a commensurate sense of strategic satisfaction when your group pulls off a victory. For another, it boasts a thought-provoking theme of anti-colonialism, with players taking the roles of elemental gods working together to repel a colonizing invader. Winning means using a combination of your native worshippers and your special elemental powers to plan a way of predicting the path of invasion and throwing them back into the sea.</p><h2>Brian Boru</h2><div id="154466"><p><h3>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h3></p></div><p>The titular Brian was a famous king of medieval Ireland, whose campaign of military, social and economic might to unify the island is replicated in this fascinating trick-tacking game. After drafting their cards, players compete in tricks to win control of towns on a map of Ireland, but losing cards net critical resources to use in marriage, supporting the church or seeing off Viking invaders. Failing to balance all these elements can cost you the game, while other players will be competing to steal your tricks away or usurp you on one of the game’s supporting tracks. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brian-boru-high-king-ireland-board-game-review">Brian Boru review</a> for more details about it.</p><h2>Dune: Imperium</h2><div id="155275"><p><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p>Dune was one of the movie events of 2021 and it just so happens it’s very well supported with board game spinoffs. Among them is Dune: Imperium, where players are the nobles of the Dune universe, each building their own deck of cards representing their resources, influence and personnel. These can then be played to board spaces to intrigue with other factions or do battle on the planet’s surface, or held for an extra effect on a “reveal” turn. It’s a potent, spicy mixture, forcing players to keep tweaking their deck builds and strategies as the drama unfolds.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review"><em>Dune: Imperium review</em></a><em> for more.</em></p><h2>Frosthaven | Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2><div><div id="155276"><p><h3>Frosthaven</h3></p></div><div id="155277"><p><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p><div><p>Playable as a standalone game, or as an expansion to Gloomhaven.</p></div></div></div><p>Topping the “best of lists” of many gamers and critics, Gloomhaven and its sequel Frosthaven are an extraordinary cooperative marriage of story and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>strategy board game</u></a>. You’ll run an ever-changing party of characters through a huge narrative campaign, equipping and upskilling them as they experience events and encounters. Exploration and combat unfold via a challenging, tight tactical engine driven by multi-use cards, where failure and death are constant threats for the unwary. Frosthaven is bigger, bolder and better than the original if you can find time in your life for its mammoth amount of content. If the length and price of these behemoths put you off, you can still get most of the pleasure from the cut-down prequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a>.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review"><em>review of Frosthaven</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Ready Set Bet</h2><div id="196160"><p><h3>Ready Set Bet</h3></p></div><p>There are a lot of games on this list that interpret “adult” as being sober and serious. But we all know that there are advantages to being an adult, too, such as being able to scream and shout and play games with irresponsible themes, such as the horse-racing title Ready Set Bet. It’s a simple, fast-paced affair where you throw betting chips down on a mat indicating which horse you think will win, getting multipliers based on the odds or a penalty if you’re wrong. The catch is that you can add bets as the race progresses, and you see which horses are in the lead, but you can’t supplant an existing bet. This leads to a double-whammy of excitement as the horses thunder down the cardboard while you panic about how early you dare put your stake. Add in special power cards and a variety of prop bets, and you've got a sure-fire winner, even if you lose all your money.</p><h2>Terraforming Mars</h2><div id="155280"><p><h3>Terraforming Mars</h3></p></div><p>If none of the other games on this list tickles your fancy, then Terraforming Mars’ cross-genre blending might be what you need. In your quest to civilize Mars before your competitors you’ll need to juggle hand management, resource gathering and positional play on the planet’s surface, all these factors tying together into one neat package. Best of all, for a game of this style, they also help conjure a real sense of humanity coloniing the red planet, inch by dusty inch. The different corporation powers and card deals make each game feel new and stop there from being a guaranteed path to victory.</p><p><em>See our list of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><em>best solo board games</em></a><em> for more like this</em></p><h2>Root</h2><div id="155278"><p><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3></p></div><p>From the box art, you might assume this is a kids’ game about cute woodland animals. In fact, it’s a fascinating and multi-layered exploration of the meaning of power for different groups in society. There are four factions in the game: the traditionalist birds, the industrialized cats, the oppressed woodland folk and the lone Vagabond. Each has its own set of rules and goals to bring to this highly asymmetrical game where you’ll marshal troops and cards to build up your resources, fight and advance your goals. And if the layered strategic puzzle isn’t thoughtful enough, you can discuss the political and philosophical ramifications of the game’s model afterwards.</p><h2>Mind MGMT</h2><div id="155273"><p><h3>Mind MGMT</h3></p></div><p>You might never have heard of the psychic espionage comic series on which this is based, but that won’t keep you from enjoying its sublime blend of strategy and surrealism. One player, the recruiter, moves in secret on a hidden map, trying to visit enough recruiting locations to win. The other players work as a team, using a limited pool of actions to try and gain clues to the recruiter’s movements and objectives so they can corner and capture them. A fun new puzzle of bluff and deduction on every play, Mind MGMT is brilliantly enlivened by a series of closed boxes containing extra game elements you can open and add at your leisure.  See our complete <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mind-mgmt-board-game-review">Mind MGMT review</a> for more info.</p><h2>Anachrony</h2><div id="155279"><p><h3>Anachrony: Essential Edition</h3></p></div><p>Worker placement, where you have a limited pool of pieces to assign to actions on the board, is a common mechanic in mid- and heavy-weight games. Anachrony takes it to the next level by allowing you to “borrow” workers and resources from your future turns as part of its time-traveling theme. Failure to pay back your loans when that turn rolls around has predictably dire consequences. Atop the usual business of juggling the resources you need to climb one of the game’s paths this makes it feel fresh, complex and challenging while also evoking a classic science fiction theme. </p><h2>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h2><div id="155163"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p>If you’re looking a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">good horror board game</a>, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a no-brainer. The base game comes with a small handful of scenarios that sends you directly into the jaws of cosmic mystery. You can use the suggested starter decks, or build a custom one centered around your chosen investigator’s special abilities. Gameplay sees you hopping from location to location to search for clues in order to advance the story while attempting to impede the deadly Mythos deck. Your investigator will inevitably take damage and acquire weaknesses over time that can affect future games in the campaign, making Arkham Horror: The Card Game one of the most thematic games on this list.

Fortunately, Xur has set up shop and has a fresh supply of Exotic weapons catalysts and armor pieces to help you out. Here's where Xur is this week, and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the weapon catalysts for Acrius and MIDA Multi-Tool. Hunters can pick up <strong>Shards of Galanor</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Armamentarium</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Karnstein Armlets</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322795-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322795" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322795-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322795"></a><figcaption>Xur's new location in the Tower's Bazaar area.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322795-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44. Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

This makes the armor useful for when you want to charge up your Super bar or take advantage of buffs like Radiant--depending on the Fragment you have equipped--and more grenades in PvP is never a bad thing. Ideally you'd want a high discipline stat with this chest armor, and fortunately, that's just what you get. Recovery is even higher, so this can work nicely with a Devour buff if you spec your Titan right, although resilience, intellect, and strength are quite low. This version of the armor might work best as a PvP-focused piece of gear.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 26</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 67</li></ul><h3>Shards of Galanor (Exotic Hunter gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322863-destiny22024-06-2119-07-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322863" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322863-destiny22024-06-2119-07-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322863"></a><figcaption>Shards of Galanor</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322863-destiny22024-06-2119-07-03.jpg"></figure><p>We're seeing a lot of great builds designed to get you your Super as quickly as possible, and with Shards of Galanor, you'll be popping that ability pretty often if you build around it. Throwing Knife final blows decrease the cooldown of your Super and final blows with Blade Barrage will return Super energy depending on how many enemies you hit with it. The crucial intellect stat could be higher, but overall, it's nicely balanced along resilience, strength, and mobility. You'll need to mod recovery and discipline, as those stats are very low.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 66</li></ul><h3>Karnstein Armlets (Exotic Warlock gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322864-destiny22024-06-2119-07-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322864" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322864-destiny22024-06-2119-07-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322864"></a><figcaption>Karnstein Armlets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4322864-destiny22024-06-2119-07-20.jpg"></figure><p>This Exotic got some nice changes this season, as melee and finisher final blows instantly grant cure and provide restoration for a short duration. Pair this with the Red Death Exotic weapon and a healing-focused build, and you'll keep your health bar in the green all the time. Strangely, the recovery stat on this is extremely low, while mobility is unnecessarily high. Intellect is the highest stat, but discipline and strength pale in comparison. If you already have a set of Karnstein Armlets in your arsenal, the stats are likely way better than the ones on this roll, so feel free to give it a skip.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 25</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 26</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 69</li></ul><h2>Exotic Weapon Catalysts</h2><h3>No Distractions (MIDA Multi-Tool)</h3><p>Aiming this weapon for a short period reduces flinch.</p><h3>Deeper Pockets and Trench Barrel (Acrius)</h3><p>Increased ammo reserves.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tarisland/" data-ref-id="5000-630415">Tarisland</a>, a new free-to-play MMORPG from Chinese gaming giant Tencent, is available now, and it very much looks to have taken some inspiration from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking for a classic, tab-targeting fantasy MMO, Tarisland fits the bill. Unlike some free-to-play MMORPGs, Tencent <a href="https://tarisglobal.com/en/news-tarisland-launches-globally-on-june-21.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">states</a> it's looking to create a game without pay-to-win mechanics and "insists on creating a fair world that offers pure fun." The game will release new seasonal content regularly, which Tencent says will add new maps to explore, quests, and dungeons. It's available on PC and mobile, and features cross-play and cross-progression between platforms.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tarisland - Reveal Trailer (Chinese MMO)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At launch, Tarisland features nine classes to choose from, ranging from fantasy staples like Paladin, Warrior, and Priest to more-unique archetypes, like the Shadow Swordsman or the Phantom Necro. In terms of endgame PvE content, Tarisland currently has five five-player dungeons and eight 10-player raids. For the PvP inclined, there is also an Arena mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The MMO, which is available on PC as well as mobile, was revealed early last year, right around the same time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chinese-wow-servers-shut-down-after-14-years-following-expiration-of-netease-agreement/1100-6510829/" data-ref-id="1100-6510829">Blizzard's MMO was pulled from China due to a breakdown in contract negotiations</a> between Activision and Blizzard's Chinese publisher, NetEase. Blizzard announced earlier this year it had struck a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-pc-titles-will-return-to-china-under-new-deal-with-netease/1100-6522533/" data-ref-id="1100-6522533">new licensing deal with NetEase that will see WoW and other Blizzard games</a> return to China.</p><p dir="ltr">Tencent's timing of the announcement, and the look of Tarisland, didn't go unnoticed by WoW players at the time, who quickly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tencent-mmo-tarisland-is-already-being-called-a-wow-clone-by-fans/1100-6510745/" data-ref-id="1100-6510745">labeled the MMO a "WoW clone."</a> There's no denying Tarisland does takes heavy inspiration from WoW and the various races of Azeroth, with one of the game's cinematics even mimicking the opening cinematic of WoW's Cataclysm expansion. One of the first groups of NPCs players encounter are a group of bull-like characters that look extremely similar to WoW's Tauren, right down to their Native American-inspired clothing and dwellings. In another example, Tarisland's Ranger class has some strong Night Elf energy, and there are even airships adorned with giant eagles that look extremely similar to the ones Alliance players in WoW have ridden on for decades. The list goes on. Even one of WoW's original creators, Chris Metzen, had to do a <a href="https://x.com/ChrisMetzen/status/1615905814610612224" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">double-take</a> after the first Tarisland trailer was revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">However, all those similarities don't necessarily have to be a bad thing, as the game seems capable of standing on its own. For those interested in checking out what Tarisland has to offer, the game is available for download on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tarisland/id6448271090" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ld.trssjhw&amp;hl=en_US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a> stores, as well as directly through the Tarisland <a href="https://tarisglobal.com/en/home.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a> for PC players. Watching <a href="https://x.com/Taris_Official/status/1804159890551718393" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tarisland gameplay on Twitch</a> between June 21 and July 8 will earn players some additional rewards. At the time of writing, around 60,000 people were watching Tarisland content on Twitch.</p>

 <h3 id="h-sister-blades" data-injectable="false">Sister Blades</h3> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">The Sister Blades are my favorite weapons in the game. Why? Well, not only are they fun to use, but their Daedalus Hammer upgrades are some of the most impressive in the game. Consider these next time you rock the blades:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Spiral Knives</strong> <ul> <li>Your Specials deal +20% damage and your Omega Special fires up to 16 shots around you in a circular pattern. Combined with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-weapon-aspects-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aspect of Pan</a>, Spiral Knives is an absolute killer of elites and Guardians.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Melting Dart</strong> <ul> <li>Perfect for encounters with armored elites, Melting Dart causes your Special to destroy 50% of any Armor based on the total amount.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Dancing Knives</strong> <ul> <li>This upgrade makes it so your Special moves deal 15% more damage and each hit will bounce toward up to two more enemies. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">Truth be told, most (if not all) Daedalus Hammer upgrades for the Sister Blades are incredible in their own right. You could replace my list above with any other combination and you should do just as well or even better, depending on your build. Mix and match, and just enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj2dmQruJXs&amp;pp=ygUQZnV0dXJhbWEgcm9iZXJ0bw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the stabbing</a>.</p>

This causes your damage to increase exponentially and lets you dash while performing the Omega Attack. It’s bliss.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Giga Cleaver</strong> <ul> <li>This upgrade lets you fire off your Omega Special twice in a row for +15 Magick. If you’re basing your build around the Omega Special, Giga Cleaver is a necessity.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Empowering Guard</strong> <ul> <li>Don’t forget: The Moonstone Axe not only attacks, but it’s one of the rare weapons with a defensive move built-in.

 <h3 id="h-argent-skull" data-injectable="false">Argent Skull</h3> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">As weird as it is, I actually adore the Argent Skull weapon. It’s deceptively powerful and has taken me to some satisfying victories in <em>Hades 2</em>. To earn your own wins with the Skulls, look for these upgrades to try:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Twisting Crash</strong> <ul> <li>Twisting Crash activates the Omega Special move again, this time bringing the waves back toward you. It allows you to dish out twice the damage whenever you use the move.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bolstered Array</strong> <ul> <li>Let’s face it: Having only three Shells can make using the Argent Skull more difficult. Bolstered Array adds two more Shells to fire.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Destructive Array</strong> <ul> <li>With this upgrade, the Shells you fire will keep dealing 50% Attack damage around them every 2.5 seconds. The upgrade works wonders against slow-moving bosses or stationary foes, allowing you to focus on dodging while still dishing out the pain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="false">Keep in mind that this list is subjective and liable to change. For the most part, the best Daedalus Hammer upgrades in <em>Hades 2</em> are the ones that suit your play style and build the most. The list above, however, does contain what I feel to be the absolute most essential upgrades, so I encourage you to check them out on your way <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-does-passing-time-work-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to kill Time</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After several test periods, <em>Tarisland</em> was officially released globally. There have been quite a few balance changes for most of the classes across all the test periods, meaning the meta has been shaken up quite a bit. We’ve put together these <em>Tarisland</em> class tier lists for the global release so you can see which classes are best in both PvE and PvP.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-tarisland-class-tier-list-for-pve" data-injectable="false"><em>Tarisland</em> Class Tier List for PvE</h2> <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="833" data-injectable="true">In PvE, not all classes are equal in <em>Tarisland</em>. While overall most classes will be able to perform their duties to completion, there are certainly better classes than others. The classes we’ve put in the S Tier will be the top of the meters for their respective roles, and those in the A Tier will also compete in certain encounters. Classes in the B Tier may have periods in which they shine, while those in thee C Tier are not recommended as they are the weakest at their role. Here are the best classes for PvE in <em>Tarisland</em>:</p>
 <h3 id="h-s-tier" data-injectable="false">S Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Barbarian (Thunder, DPS)</li> <li>Bard (Solo, DPS)</li> <li>Bard (Harmony, Healer)</li> <li>Mage (Fire, DPS)</li> <li>Paladin (Guard, Tank)</li> <li>Ranger (Hunting, DPS)</li> <li>Shadow Swordsman (Cunning, DPS)</li> <li>Warrior (War Shield, Tank)</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-a-tier" data-injectable="false">A Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"> <li>Mage (Frost, DPS)</li> <li>Paladin (Justice, DPS)</li> <li>Phantom Necromancer (Soul Snatch, DPS)</li> <li>Priest (Pray, Healer)</li> <li>Ranger (Tamed Beast, DPS)</li> <li>Shadow Swordsman (Duel, DPS)</li> <li>Warrior (Rage, DPS)</li> </ul>

With this tier list, we try to highlight which classes will have a better off time specifically in Battlegrounds and upcoming Arena PvP, as there is no such thing as world PvP in <em>Tarisland</em>. Classes in the S Tier will always be efficient in PvP, while those in the A Tier are solid options that will not have any issues. Those in the B Tier have situational strengths in PvP scenarios while those in the C Tier are not recommended as they are a bit undertuned at the moment. Here are the best classes for PvP in <em>Tarisland</em>:</p>
 <h3 id="h-s-tier-0" data-injectable="false">S Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Mage (Frost, DPS)</li> <li>Priest (Pray, Healer)</li> <li>Ranger (Hunting, DPS)</li> <li>Shadow Swordsman (Duel, DPS)</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-a-tier-0" data-injectable="false">A Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"> <li>Bard (Solo, DPS)</li> <li>Bard (Harmony, Healer)</li> <li>Mage (Fire, DPS)</li> <li>Paladin (Justice, DPS)</li> <li>Phantom Necromancer (Soul Snatch, DPS)</li> <li>Ranger (Tamed Beast, DPS)</li> <li>Shadow Swordsman (Cunning, DPS)</li> <li>Warrior (Rage, DPS)</li> <li>Warrior (War Shield, Tank)</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the ever-crowded world of games inspired by the work of FromSoftware, you wouldn’t expect the story of a plucky hermit crab trying to recover his beloved shell from an undersea capitalist hellscape to hit the nail so thoroughly.</p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">The setting of <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>couldn’t be any further from Lordran, or Drangelic, or Lothric, and so on. Instead of a grim expanse, players are immediately introduced to a colorful ecosystem in the depths of the ocean, at least for most of the adventure. Under that spongy veil, thorough challenges await, ready to pounce on the adorably naive Kril.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">The story starts innocently enough. Kril is minding his own business when a loan shark — you can probably imagine how literal this interpretation is — appears and reclaims his shell, citing the Duchy of Slacktide’s annexation of this particular tide pool. It turns out Kril owes more than his fair share of back taxes, so unless he can pony up he’s out one delightful little home-on-the-go.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">From there, Kril’s adventure begins, taking him through an aquatic world under the affliction of a mysterious curse. That curse, it turns out, is our good friend pollution, an inevitable side effect of the aforementioned capitalist hellscape. As above, so below.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em> <strong>(PC [Reviewed], PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)</strong><br><strong>Developer: Aggro Crab</strong><br><strong>Publisher: Aggro Crab</strong><br><strong>Released: April 25, 2024</strong><br><strong>MSRP: $29.99</strong></p> <h2 id="h-wetter-is-better" data-injectable="false">Wetter is better</h2> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">Despite his seemingly innocent nature, Kril isn’t going to take this one lying down. He quickly grabs a fork and sets off on a quest to get his shell back, getting more than he bargained for along the way. As he meets new allies and uncovers new, more intimidating parts of the sea, he’ll have to fend off all the crustaceans and similarly mad creatures that have already succumbed to the affliction known as “Gunk.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="700" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Many of the classic Soulslike ponderments are answered right out of the gate. What’s the stand-in for Bonfires? Moon Snail Shells. Is there a parry and riposte system it would behoove you to master? Absolutely. There’s even a primary central location known as The Sands Between, so the team at Aggro Crab are having plenty of fun with the sub-genre. As Kril progresses, he’ll enter arenas littered with empty shells, taking in the scenery briefly before some hulking foe appears, health bar stretching across the screen like the yawning abyss itself.&nbsp;In many ways, especially with grappling present, it’s even closer to something like FromSoft’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">If Kril wants to survive more than a few hits in these and even the countless standard enemy battles, he’ll need to find the right shell for the job. Thankfully, the very detritus that contributes to the decline of maritime civilization can be used to your advantage. Soda bottle tops, shot glasses, and thimbles can become trusty means of defense. If you’re really in a pinch, you can slip into a banana peel, or maybe a discarded milk carton; they all have their own unique stats, from the amount of damage they can take to built-in secondary attacks and buffs.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="657" data-current-count="957" data-injectable="true">When the going gets tough — and it often does — you can always increase stats through leveling. Defeated enemies and bosses drop Microplastics, which are this game’s take on Souls. You can also sell junk you find, from clothespins to paperclips, for larger amounts of Microplastics. Aiding you further is a skill tree, the nodes of which can be purchased with crystals. It starts with the basic Shelleportation skill that lets you warp between Moon Snail Shells. From there, it branches off into everything from the essential parry and riposte to the ability to use consumable Barbed Hook items to reel in vulnerable enemies for a pummelin’.</p>
 <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">Toss in Stowaways, which can add passive benefits when you have a shell equipped, as well as powerful Adaptation moves, and you have an action game that gives you plenty of options for improvement and the eventual besting of some legitimately tough opponents. Despite its cute exterior, <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>doesn’t shy away from throwing you into the deep end quick, both literally and figuratively. In true genre fashion, you’ll die and die again at the hands of its many bosses, but Kril always has a fighting chance to survive.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">One of the advantages is the fact that you don’t respawn all the way back at the nearest Moon Snail Shell after a boss kills you. Instead, you have the option of returning to life right outside the arena. Said arenas always have more shells to pick up, and there are often extra Heartkelp Pods — the equivalent of flasks — lying around. If all of that isn’t enough of an advantage for you, you could always just shrug, cock your gun, and let the fight end before it even begins. &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-armed-and-dangerous" data-injectable="false">Armed and dangerous</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="580" data-current-count="880" data-injectable="true">Let’s talk about the gun. Yes, Kril has a gun, and it packs some mighty heat. Kril’s gun isn’t something you’re going to find buried deep in the darkest depths of the ocean; it’s actually sitting right there waiting for you at the bottom of the accessibility menu. <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>is keen on letting you have fun, regardless of your skill level, so there are a wealth of options to choose from should you ever find yourself banging your head against a particularly rigid wall. Among those options is one especially powerful last resort.</p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">If you toggle the gun on, it appears as a literal gun in place of Kril’s shell, absolutely dwarfing him. Not that it takes much to dwarf a tiny hermit crab, but still, it’s really big. That makes it extra funny when Kril uses it to fire at enemies, most of which will go down in one shot from a very generous distance. This applies to bosses, as well. If your skills aren’t quite cutting it at any point in the journey, you can just toggle the gun on and one-shot that colossal creature that’s been thrashing you for the past hour or so.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="951" data-current-count="951" data-injectable="true">Naturally, if you choose to use the gun, you’re not going to get any better at <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>. Allow me to push my spectacles up and murmur, just loud enough to hear, <em>“”You cheated not only the game, but yourself,</em>“<em> etc. etc</em>. If you want to improve, you’ll have to brave Kril’s toughest challenges with the abilities you’ve earned. If you don’t, though, or if you just want to breeze through a section of the game? Hell, go for it. I know it’s controversial, but I believe games should be fun, and if you’re not having fun, you should either play a different game or let a crab use a gun. There are other less “final” options, too, like decreasing the damage Kril takes, lowering enemy health, or even increasing the parry and dodge windows. Whether you use them or not, it’s great that features like this exist and do nothing to detract from the game itself.</p>
 <h2 id="h-that-swamp-is-poisooon" data-injectable="false">That swamp is poisooon</h2> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Circling back to that FromSoft checklist, the team at Aggro Crab decided to seal their loving missive to Hidetaka Miyazaki and co. with a deadly kiss. Yes, there is a poison swamp equivalent in <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, and yes it is a pain in the ass. It’s very easy to fall in and boost your poison meter, or have some gnarly fish vomit on you and boost your poison meter, or, you get the picture. Somewhere, Miyazaki is smiling the most devilish of smiles, reflecting upon the hell he so effectively wrought.</p>
 <p data-characters="660" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">This area was really the turning point for me. While the whole of Flotsam Vale wasn’t actually that miserable, it sets the tone for the rest of the adventure. Kril eventually makes his way beyond a pier, to a factory that deals in magnet manipulation and platforming and very much overstays its welcome. I’ve certainly played 3D action games with worse platforming, but <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>never really makes a case for why it’s so prevalent. There’s a lot of verticality, and the punishment for falling is minimal, but between wrestling with the camera and just wanting to get on with it, the tuna was starting to turn.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">By the time I completed the area, I figured I was getting near the end anyway, but there’s actually a ton of game beyond that. Some of it is really great! Some of it, not so much. On one hand, I absolutely appreciate how much work went into Kril’s journey. Aggro Crab put a ton of care into this, from the surprisingly earnest and funny story to some excellent voice acting and an abundance of fully-realized locales and imaginative challenges.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="582" data-current-count="882" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, much of it left me feeling fatigued. Each individual area is typically populated with a handful of enemies that you’ll either love squaring off against or feel the need to avoid at all costs. I found myself being momentarily wowed in each new zone before quickly wanting to rush ahead and see what else they cooked up for me. You know what that sounds like? <em>Dark Souls</em>! Like I said, they absolutely nailed what they were going for. There comes a certain point, though, when seeing the credits roll sooner might have been a salve for a wounded warrior.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">As draining as I found some of the backend to be, most of the boss fights are really well done. Like all good games of the genre, I still find myself thinking about many of them well after completing the main story. I loved the moves of bosses like Heikea, Intimidation Crab, who stomps down atop a sunken boat and wails at Kril with a set of freshly-snapped chopsticks, the arena littered with sushi rolls that can serve as makeshift shells.&nbsp;Voltai, the Accumulator, is an electric eel with some novel stage-based gimmicks. Even the final boss has some interesting surprises in store. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="1027" data-injectable="true">Even with some crab-meat caveats, it’s really difficult to be too down on my overall experience. There’s so much to like about <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>that I keep coming back to everything they accomplished. The underwater world, the puns, the monster designs that include iconic threats like “crab with knives rubber-banded to its claws”; it is the very essence of commitment to the bit. Outside of some frustrating platforming, it’s also just really fun to move Kril around. The way he skitters across the ocean floor, fluidly dodge-rolls to and fro, uses his hook to zip higher up, and floats with all his might to get just a bit more distance under his little leggies; great stuff.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Part of me wishes <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>predated the <em>Souls </em>games, just so we would have to refer to genre offshoots as Crablikes. The sauce is certainly thick on this one, and I’ll be thinking about it for quite some time. <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>pulls off exactly what it set out to do, and it’s going to be a favorite for many. Thanks to some of the less palatable late-game moments, it didn’t quite get to that level for me, but I very much appreciate all the shell-bound friends and pelagic puns I met along the way.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft revealed a remastered Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th anniversary edition  this week, out on 25th June, but that's not the Beyond Good &amp; Evil many are hungering for. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> was announced back in 2008, around 16 years ago. I remember writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/omigod-omigod-omigod">that trailer of Pey'j the porcine mechanic eating a fly</a> for a blog somewhere. "Fly-eating mechanics confirmed?" I probably scribbled, in the blessed innocence of youth.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Since then, it's been one long series of delays, reannouncements, key team departures and sad losses. Original director Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rayman-co-creator-michel-ancel-says-hes-leaving-video-games">left Ubisoft in 2020</a> following <a href="https://www.vg247.com/report-michel-ancel-accused-of-abusive-disruptive-practices-on-beyond-good-evil-2">accusations of disorganised and abusive management</a>, while creative director Emile Morel died suddenly in July 2023 at the age of 40. Many speculate that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will never make it into the wilds. Ubisoft have, however, sought to restore the faith a little by adding a new mission to the Beyond Good &amp; Evil anniversary edition which links to the events of the sequel.
</p>
<p>
The mission in question is a treasure hunt in which players can learn about protagonist Jade's childhood by acquiring cosmetic rewards. "This exclusive new mission also reveals more about the narrative link to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, showing Ubisoft's enduring commitment to the franchise," Ubisoft promised in a press release.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't take this as a hint that a Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 re-reveal is imminent, but I find it more concrete as evidence that development is on-going than any of Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-beyond-good-evil-2-has-survived-ubisofts-recent-game-cull">recent reassurances</a>. I imagine the game has changed a lot since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-a-long-look-through-the-spyglass-at-beyond-good-and-evil-2-in-action">last big public splash at E3 2018</a>, which wowed us with talk of procedural planets, simulated solar system physics, jetpacks, swordfights and the ability to build your own starfighter. Here's that footage again, for auld time's sake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183139/league-of-legends-anima-squad-swarm-summer-event-2024-game-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="TCEmnc"><em>League of Legends</em>’ summer event is always a highlight for the year. In past years, we’ve seen visual novels and deep dives into alternate universes like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23760910/league-of-legends-soul-fighter-summer-event-arena-game-mode-new">Soul Fighter</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23363529/league-of-legends-spirit-blossom-skins-syndra-sett-soraka">Spirit Blossom</a>, or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23216757/league-of-legends-star-guardian-fan-response">Star Guardian</a>. This year, the Anima Squad skin line gets the spotlight, along with a new survivor-style bullet heaven game that can be played co-op or solo.</p>
<p id="oEb5JC">Anima Squad debuted in 2022, and depicts <em>League</em> champions as cybernetic, animal-themed warriors defending humanity. This year, we’re getting new crew members like Battle Bunny Aurora, the new champion’s debut skin; Battle Bear Illaoi; and Cyber Cat Yuumi. </p>
<p id="0apaqQ">In the lore of Anima Squad, humanity has been pushed back to a few bastions. Primordials, the white blood cells of Earth, have become hostile to humanity. These kaiju-like creatures are swarming out of the oceans, and only a few heroes wearing repurposed Primordial technology can protect what remains.</p>
<p id="Snc2jl">The new game mode is called Swarm, or Operation: Anima Squad. Players can queue up solo, or play with up to three friends. This game mode plays very differently than standard <em>League of Legends</em>; it’s much closer to <em>Vampire Survivors</em> with a WASD control scheme. The player must survive a showdown in Final City, mowing down waves of Primordials. Every match gives rewards that lead to greater power over time, so even a failed match can pay off down the road and eventually help you survive longer, kill more Primordials, and earn more rewards.</p>
<p id="FSjchJ">We’re also getting a huge list of new skins: Seraphine, Yuumi, Leona, Xayah, Illaoi, Aurora, and Yasuo join Anima Squad while Briar, Rek’Sai, and Bel’Veth play the antagonistic Primordials (although Briar defects to join the good guys, making her a bit of both). This year, the summer event runs from July 17 to Aug. 19. As with past game modes, it’s possible that Swarm could return to <em>League of Legends</em> in the future — we’ll have to wait and see what Riot thinks of player reception to Operation: Anima Squad first. </p>

Most notable are the addition of four new Special Bots hidden in each of the game’s core worlds. If you’re looking to round up the <em>Bloodborne</em> Special Bot in GPU Jungle and obtain its respective trophy (Hunted Down), we’ve got everything you need to know below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-addresses-tango-gameworks-closure-sort-of/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced four studio closures</a> in May, seeing Tango Gameworks listed as one of them was of the most surprising. Now, in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/xbox-studios-matt-booty-podast-game-pass-fallout-studio-closures-1236038120/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with Variety</a>, Xbox Games Studio head Matt Booty gave some small insight as to what happened with the Hi-Fi Rush developer and why it was shut down.</p>



<p>Though he wouldn’t go into the “nitty gritty details” of what happened out of what he called respect for those who were at the studio, he did talk the decision being a “forward-looking situation” for Microsoft.</p>



<p>“I think the thing to be considered is that, for us, it’s as much a forward-looking situation as much as it is looking back at one certain game,” Booty said. “There are a lot of things that go into [delivering] success for a game. What leadership do you have? What creative leadership do you have? Is the team the same team that shipped something successful previously? </p>



<p>“We have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves ‘are we set up for success going forward?'”</p>



<p>Tango Gameworks founder Shinji Mikami <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-to-leave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left the studio</a> in February 2023 after the release of Hi-Fi Rush, which Booty confirmed “did well” for Microsoft. While it wasn’t explicitly mentioned, Booty did make a comment regarding having proper leadership in place was a factor in a studio’s future.</p>



<p>He also that studio changes don’t always have to mean closures, and pointed to Toys for Bob specifically as one that went independent. </p>



<p>“We recently had Toys for Bob…go back out and become a new independent studio,” he said. “We’ve announced we’ve got a publishing deal with them and we’ll share more about that when it’s important.</p>



<p>“I think back to a studio called Twisted Pixel in Texas that we acquired, then we had a change in goals and it wasn’t a perfect match anymore. That studio today is still thriving. We wanted to set them up for success, so we absolutely look at what the possible business options are.”</p>



<p>Again, though not explicitly said, the comments on Toys for Bob and Twisted Pixel could be lead one to believe that Microsoft tried to either sell or make Tango Gameworks an independent studio before the decision to close. What ultimately led to the final decision, however, is anyone’s guess. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-preview-wandering-through-an-empty-house-hasnt-been-this-fascinating-since-gone-home<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One in-game day, 50 rooms, infinite choices.</h2></div><section><p>I’m never more excited than when I’m playing games where I’m not even sure the main mechanic is fundamentally interesting. Despite hours playing Blue Prince and still thinking about it when I’m doing anything else, somehow, delightfully, I can’t figure it out. This clawing madness - trying to get a sense of whether this is all a waste of time, while happily wasting that time - is a feeling few things have been able to evoke within me.</p><p>With Blue Prince, the first release from up-until-now film studio Dogubomb, that metagaming sense of not quite having the full picture in mind perfectly mirrors the in-game activity of exploring a procedurally generated mansion in search of its answers and rarely finding any.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Blue Prince Slideshow - Tribeca Festival</h3></div></output><p>Hurrying through the grand estate of Mt. Holly to ensure the retrieval of some inheritance from a departed family member, every time you open a door you’re presented with a choice of three additional rooms. Whichever one gets picked is instantly bolted on ahead, as if it was always there. Each room is carefully authored by the development team, but the order that they’re offered up is procedurally chosen from a pool that grows in size over the course of a run. Ideally every choice is the one that’s most beneficial for that moment. Often enough, it’s actually just the least worst. </p><p>A decent handful of these rooms are complete dead-ends. Maybe they’ll contain a useful item like a key or a gem, which will need to be spent to place more complicated structures. Some of the rooms have additional doors which lead on to other rooms. If you’re lucky, you’re facing the right direction, and there aren’t any other rooms already blocking the potential exits, a hallway or such with multiple additional doors will appear and you’ll be able to create even more options for how to proceed.
</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Certain techniques for making proper progress are beginning to occur to me after more than five hours playing the surprisingly generous demo. I’m deliberately drafting dead-end rooms without much clear need to return in the same area of the map so that I don’t waste time heading back to them. Each in-game day limits your exploration to entering just 50 rooms before having to start a new run, with the ability to gain more energy earned through making good room choices. Ideally, every room is placed with all the important stuff together to limit any back-tracking, but Man Plans, God Laughs.</p><p>Some of these rooms offer unique features and challenges. Drafting the Security Room gives access to a terminal showing all the items that have been missed during exploration. A photography Dark Room will completely obscure which of the three selections you’re actually picking for your next move, unless you’ve managed to find the mansion’s breaker box and manually turned the lights back on. Placing a chapel - which demands an immediate tithe of 1 gold coin every time you walk through it - would be terrible in a busy intersection, but it’d be great to put the bedroom walkway that replenishes some of your energy in a spot you’re likely to return to often. Certain rooms only seem to appear on the edges of the 9x5 grid, of which many are expensive green rooms which regularly need multiple gems to unlock, though that cost can be mitigated by getting lucky enough to select an early room that voids the expense toward any future green rooms entirely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Strategy in Blue Prince is, then, all about location and timing. Picking bad rooms feels great when there’s a lot of options for where to move on to next, and it’s agonizingly tense when the only three options available, on the last free door of the run, are all glorified closets.</p><p>But I couldn’t help but wonder if it even works. I don't know if continually seeing the same environments in different orders is compelling, in and of itself. Maybe it’s the limited input. I’m not against a walking sim, but I’m hesitant to play a walking sim that asks me to continue to see the same things over and over. Blue Prince occasionally injects puzzles and surprise features - the Parlor Room, which appears with a unique guessing-game each time it’s drafted - is a fun reprieve every time, but the Billiards Room, which offers different takes on the same rudimentary math problem of addition, subtraction and multiplication, gets pretty dull after the second appearance.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Something strange happened in this place and you’re forced to both know that and still be there.&nbsp;</p></div><p>I’ve been thinking about it in contrast with 2021’s Phantom Abyss, another game about revisiting the same procedurally generated environments under different contexts, where the purpose was for you to make the perfect execution of movement to avoid danger and be quicker than everyone else that came before. Blue Prince’s mystery hasn’t hooked me, though the presentation – with gorgeous cutscenes that have far greater investment than you might expect – is really noteworthy.</p><p>Blue Prince isn’t a scary game. There are sparse musical cues in key moments of discovery that help build the atmosphere, but it’s un-scary in the same way Gone Home is un-scary. Nothing’s going to jump out and chase you, but something strange happened in this place and you’re forced to both know that and still be there. </p><p>Blue Prince’s demo is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>. I wonder if you’ll end up any clearer than me on what you think about it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now that the highly anticipated downloadable content is available, on June 21, that number has risen to 39.6%.</p><p>While a rise of almost two percentage points doesn't seem like a lot, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring has sold a colossal 25 million units since its release in February 2022</a>. Even if just one million of those played on Steam (the actual number is likely much higher), that would mean 18,000 players jumped back into Elden Ring to make final preparations ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>FromSoftware games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and now Elden Ring demand more from players than a chunk of money to access their DLC. Mohg is just one of the bosses players must beat to access Shadow of the Erdtree, though the other one is part of the main story so anyone who's completed Elden Ring will have already ticked that box.</p><p>Many would assume this to be an issue for FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, given the game itself is essentially stopping more than half its player base from accessing the DLC and therefore wanting to spend more money. But Bandai Namco Europe's chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GI.biz</a> that Elden Ring has sold so many copies that it basically doesn't matter.</p><p>"That statistic does present a unique challenge," he said. "However, with over 25 million units sold, even a fraction of our player base constitutes a substantial audience. Our marketing efforts have been tailored to engage this significant segment effectively."</p><p>Those who've not yet jumped into the DLC can <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">ensure they've met all the requirements to access it</a>, and make sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/maps/elden-ring/lands-between">our Elden Ring interactive map</a> to ensure you're not missing any <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Scarab_Locations_and_Rewards">important collectibles</a> either.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">In our 10/10 review of the expansion</a>, IGN said: "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said. "It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p>Those looking to explore every inch of that can <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">IGN's extensive guide</a>, which covers <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">Shadow of the Erdtree's new weapons</a>, its various quest lines, and how to defeat those pesky new bosses.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

There'll be seven titles to check out, including:</p><ul><li>The Punisher (1993)</li><li>X-Men: Children Of The Atom (1994)</li><li>Marvel Super Heroes (1995)</li><li>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter (1996)</li><li>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter (1997)</li><li>Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash Of Superheroes (1998)</li><li>Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age Of Heroes (2000)</li></ul><p>Similar to Capcom's Arcade Stadium releases, the collection is a time capsule of extra content. You'll get all the music from the original arcade releases, behind-the-scenes art, and some helpful gameplay assists like one-button combos if you're new to these games. Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be out later this year for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch, but sadly, there's no planned Xbox release.</p></div>                      </div><p>The Marvel fighting games haven't been seen for quite some time on console, although they have popped up in <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1845746235896864888%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmarvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524422%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up cabinets</a> over the past couple years. Each game is a showcase of '90s fighting game magic, as Capcom's collection of brawlers featured fast-paced action, fantastic pixel art character designs, and rock-solid gameplay designed to liberate coins from your pockets. If you're looking to go online, the games will support rollback netcode, casual matches, and ranked play. Perfect for anyone looking to reawaken some muscle memory in their thumbs.</p><p>For something a little different, The Punisher is an action game in the same vein as Final Fight and Streets of Rage, as Frank Castle plies his deadly trade against an army of cannon fodder and Marvel villains. Minus its Sega Genesis port, The Punisher has skipped several console generations, so it's nice to finally see it revived for modern systems.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Mojang Studios has <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-playstation-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that a native PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft is releasing today and it is looking for preview testers. Those who own the PS4 version of the game will be able to access it.</p><p>In order to test this early version on PS5, users just need to go into the PS4 version of the game, click "Settings" and then click "Preview." The preview is set to roll out at around 9:30 AM PT / 12:30 PM ET. Mojang also clarified that purchasing the PS4 version is currently the only way to play the PS5 version, and the reason for creating a native PS5 version is that it would run more smoothly on its hardware.</p><p>This preview includes the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-1-21-update-officially-named-tricky-trials-adds-a-new-weapon/1100-6523003/" data-ref-id="1100-6523003">Tricky Trials update</a> as well. Here, players can either team up or go solo to venture into a maze filled with traps and treasures. Furthermore, in this preview, multiplayer is only available between PS4 and PS5 and there is no access to the Minecraft Store.</p><p>Last year, Minecraft was rated in Germany for the Xbox Series X|S, the first sign that the game would be coming to current consoles. During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wins-court-case-against-ftc-to-buy-activision-blizzard/1100-6515704/" data-ref-id="1100-6515704">FTC trial regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, Xbox blamed the lack of a native PS5 version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-doesnt-have-a-ps5-version-because-sony-didnt-send-microsoft-dev-kits-phil-spencer-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft on Sony</a> at the time. Microsoft said that Sony didn't send any development kits ahead of the console's release in 2020.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/inefficient-or-unexplored-insights-from-a-year-long-study-on-2d-normal-map-generators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p>Image from Death Machine by Philip Froelich, an example of a 2D-dynamically lit game using 2D-Normal maps releasing in 2024.  <span></span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the past three decades, the gaming industry has seen major advances, transitioning from predominantly 2D games utilizing traditional pixel-art graphics to a more 3D-focused industry. However, 2D was never abandoned. Instead of the AAA industry, indies have since seen major success with titles such as Cuphead and Celeste proving the potential for 2D games. One niche technology used to enhance 2D games is dynamic lighting, which adds depth and realism to 2D visuals by simulating various light interactions as seen most recently in Sabotage Games’ Sea of Stars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite its potential, there are several major challenges involved with the implementation of 2D dynamic lighting. While there are sophisticated methods that involve 3D graphics, the traditional method utilizes 2D-Normal maps, which simulate depth and texture by encoding surface normals. While the AAA gaming industry has established and well-proven workflows for generating normal maps in 3D, similar tools for 2D game development remain underutilized. This led to my year-long research project, culminating in a thesis titled “Setting Standards for 2D-Normal Map Generators.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding Normal Maps in 2D Game Development">Understanding Normal Maps in 2D Game Development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike 3D models, which inherently possess depth information, 2D art relies on normal maps to create the illusion of three-dimensionality vital for dynamic lighting. However, the process of creating 2D normal maps is labor-intensive, typically forcing artists to manually draw them for each asset. This manual process adds not just development time but also significant cost, making dynamic lighting an overly expensive feature for the smaller studios often involved with 2D.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Quest for Automation">The Quest for Automation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To address these challenges, several tools have been developed to automate the generation of these 2D normal maps. Software such as Sprite Lamp, SpriteDLight, and Laighter have attempted to streamline this process, but they have yet to gain major industry adoption. Many of these tools operate as black boxes, with proprietary algorithms and limited customization options, making it more challenging to integrate into a development workflow. Thus, I set out to research my own set of standards, to figure out what it takes to create a more attractive 2D-Normal map generation tool.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Research Methodology: Q-Sort and Expert Interviews">Research Methodology: Q-Sort and Expert Interviews</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My research focused on two questions. Firstly, what makes a good normal map and how can we rate the output of tools? Additionally, I wanted to find out what features or qualities artists value most when utilizing such tools. My research employed a combination of an exploratory Q-Sort methodology and expert interviews. The Q-Sort methodology helped assess the needs and preferences of artists working with 2D-normal maps. Participants were asked to rank various features and aspects of normal map generators, providing a structured way to identify the most critical requirements. This was complemented by interviews with experienced 2D-Normal map artists and developers to gain deeper insights into the technical and practical aspects of normal map generation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Findings and Guidelines">Key Findings and Guidelines</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The research revealed several key insights for the development of current and future 2D-normal map generators:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quality of output: Artists prioritize high-quality normal map generation that closely mimics hand-drawn maps. Tools should focus on improving the accuracy of automatically generated maps. Notable also is that the speed of the workflow was significantly less valued here, the artists involved made it clear that they don’t mind the output needing modification and/or minor fixes. As long as the bulk of the work is saved.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Trial and Error Workflow: An effective tool should support an iterative workflow, allowing artists to easily tweak and refine normal maps. This includes features for real-time preview and adjustment. Additionally, artists tend to like tools that resemble their own, so any great normal map generator should include staples such as a color picker, animation, and Undo/Redo features.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Objective Evaluation Metrics: The most disappointing conclusion was that there are currently no standardized metrics for evaluating the quality of 2D-normal maps. This means developers will have to work closely with actual 2D-normal mapping artists when evaluating the quality of their tools.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Integration with Existing Tools: Seamless integration with popular 2D art software and game engines is crucial. Often artists seemed far more interested in utilizing such technology within their established tools such as Aseprite rather than in a separate tool.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Public Learning Resources: The availability of comprehensive documentation and tutorials can help increase the accessibility of the field. The field is currently quite thin, and the hope is that an increase in public learning resources will generate more interest in young indie artists to learn these skills.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The generation of 2D-normal maps holds great potential, especially within the 2D-Indie scene. Great artists are already working on beautiful games such as @Philtacular and his upcoming Death Machine. By further streamlining the generation tools we should be able to make dynamic lighting in 2D games far more accessible and cost-effective to indie developers. I believe that it’s important that as a tiny community, we do all we can to spread the knowledge needed to pave the way for more innovative tools and techniques ultimately resulting in even more beautiful 2D games. I hope this research can be a great resource for tools developers interested in 2D-Normal maps and for researchers interested in continued exploration of this niche, but wonderful field.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My full thesis “Setting Standards for 2D-Normal Map Generators” will soon be available through the Breda University of Applied Sciences for those interested in delving deeper into my process and methodology. &nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Niantic has announced that the next set of Elite Raids will feature Mega Rayquaza, giving <em>Pokemon GO</em> players a chance to catch the legendary Pokemon. Rayquaza is a dragon and flying-type Pokemon. The Pokemon will be arriving as a Raid Boss on June 29 during different intervals on June 29, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="51" data-current-count="51" data-injectable="false">Here is the schedule for Mega Rayquaza Elite Raids:</p> <p data-characters="13" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false"><strong>June 29, 2024</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false"> <li>12 p.m. PT</li> <li>1 p.m. PT</li> <li>5 p.m. PT</li> <li>6 p.m. PT</li> </ul> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">There will also be a free Timed Research to take part in during this event, and completing the research tasks would allow players to earn a Meteorite. This is a rare item in <em>Pokemon GO</em> and is necessary to teach the Charged Attack Dragon Ascent to Rayquaza. Teaching this move is also a requirement to Mega Evolve this particular Pokemon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-defeat-mega-rayquaza" data-injectable="false">How to defeat Mega Rayquaza?</h2> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">The legendary Rayquaza is weakest against Ice attacks. It is also vulnerable to Dragon, Fairy, and Rock moves. Rayquaza is strong against Fighting, Fire, Bug, Water, Grass, and Ground moves. Since its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, there are selective Pokemon who are equipped to deal with Rayquaza during a battle. Entering this battle with a Pokemon who knows Ice attacks are a must, and their secondary attack has to be a Dragon, Fairy, or Rock attack.</p>
 <p data-characters="13" data-current-count="13" data-injectable="false"><strong>Best counters</strong></p> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Mamoswine (its shadow variant will be a better choice), Mega Gardevoir, Shadow Mewtwo, Cetitan, and Mega Glalie are some of your best choices. Mamoswine is a relatively common Pokemon among these choices, and if you do not have others, you can also go with Glaceon, the ice-type evolution of Eevee. Keep in mind that this is not an easy raid to complete on your own, and it is best to enter this fight with at least two more trainers who are well-equipped for this encounter.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-are-elite-raids" data-injectable="false">What are Elite Raids?</h2> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Elite Raids in <em>Pokemon GO</em> refers to special raid battles that arrive only for 45 minutes once a special Raid Egg hatches. Also, players can only engage in a raid battle by physically visiting a nearby gym, meaning that neither you nor your friends can join an Elite Raid battle using a Remote Raid Pass. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-zero-extraction-release-date-brings-alien-extraction-shooting-fun-in-august.907911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-zero-extraction-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Doghowl Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>release date, and the alien-blasting extraction shooter is launching later this summer.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1456940/view/6339459950921613987" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Early Access on August 6th, and if Doghowl and tinyBuild are to be believed, a great many potential players will be happy to see it arrive.</p>
<p>In that same Steam post, the two studios share some stats regarding the game's recent open beta, which ran from June 9th to June 17th and coincided with Steam Next Fest, and it turns out that thousands of players checked this one out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/level-zero-extraction-release-date-alien.jpg?itok=rf3UksPp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/level-zero-extraction-release-date-alien.jpg?itok=rdm4BfZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>brings more extraction shooter shenanigans (what else?) to Steam in August.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Doghowl and tinyBuild's stats,&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>was one of the Next Fest's most-played demos, alongside titles like&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em>.</p>
<p>The studios also say the game attracted almost 5,000 concurrent players during the open beta period, making it the second most popular demo on offer.</p>
<p><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>attracted more than 300,000 players during the demo window, and it now has over 350,000 wishlists according to Doghowl and tinyBuild, so people are certainly interested in this project at the very least.</p>
<p>Around 2.36 million matches were played during the open beta, and the game's most popular firearm by far was the Nailgun, which racked up almost 400,000 kills, almost ten times as many as the next most popular option (the G-17).</p>

<p><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, an extraction shooter with an emphasis on horror. It's explicitly being pitched by the devs as a game for those who enjoy the likes of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>(although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free">perhaps not so much anymore</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million"><i>Content Warning</i></a>.</p>
<p>The game's asymmetric multiplayer pits "elite PMC mercenar[ies]" against alien horrors controlled by players, with teams of mercenaries facing off against aliens, each other, and the environment while gathering valuable loot.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on August 6th.

			<p>Future versions of NVIDIA DLSS could use AI to generate textures and objects, among other things, potentially introducing another big game changer that could greatly impact the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/q-and-a-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Than Moore</a>, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang provided some hints regarding what future versions of NVIDIA DLSS may feature. As of now, AI is being used for neural graphics, generating pixels based off a few input pixels (Super Resolution) and to generate frames (Frame Generation), but in the future, it will be possible to even generate textures and objects and the objects can even be of lower quality and can be made to look better with AI. Additionally, it will be possible to even generate characters in games, having, for example, among a group of six characters, two real ones, and others may be long-term use AIs. Ultimately, AI will become more dominant in the future, and NVIDIA cannot wait to let more people have it.</p>
<p><em>The games will be made with AI, they’ll have AI inside, and you’ll even have the PC become AI using G-Assist. You can use the PC as an AI assistant to help you game. &nbsp;GeForce is the biggest gaming brand in the world, we only see it growing, and a lot of them have AI in some capacity. We can’t wait to let more people have it.</em></p>

<p>While the NVIDIA CEO did not specify if any of these features will be among those offered by NVIDIA DLSS 4, it will be very interesting to see what the new version of the technology will offer in addition to the aforementioned Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction introduced in major previous versions. With a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-cut-down-gb202-gpu-448-bit-bus-28-gb-gddr7-memory/">GPU generation</a> launching later this year, it may not take much longer to learn what is next for NVIDIA's technology and how AI will continue influencing and possibly shaping gaming in the future.</p>

<p id="Ij99Vl">In addition to its broad spectrum of compatibility, the 8Bitdo Pro 2 is now one of the few Bluetooth controllers equipped with Hall Effect switches, which help to reduce or eliminate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23627127/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-gulikit-stick-hall-effect-fix-installation-buy">stick drift</a> (an issue that has plagued the Nintendo Switch since its launch).</p>
<p id="4VM1W8">For those of us old enough to remember, the layout of the 8Bitdo Pro 2 most closely resembles a classic SNES controller, albeit with a pair of analog sticks and some large grips built onto the side for improved ergonomics. The Pro 2 features the same number of inputs as contemporary controllers, which can all be remapped to different profiles via the 8Bitdo Ultimate app on your PC or mobile device.</p>
