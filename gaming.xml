			<p>Last night, The Game Awards took place, where audiences all over the world tuned in to watch some world-first announcements and awards be handed out to winners across multiple categories. One of the announcements that came out last night was a new trailer with a release window for Dying Light: The Beast. It showed off some more gameplay and set the scene of the game while introducing the Baron, a crucial character in the story who was responsible for the imprisonment of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/">Kyle Crane</a>. In the event you missed the trailer last night, you can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — MEET THE BARON - THE GAME AWARDS 2024 TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Tkwem4M1uw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Baron is a cruel, emotionless husk but is a fantastic scientist and is good at what he does. He is the biggest threat to Kyle Crane, as he is the man who was responsible for experimenting on Kyle Crane for over a decade, causing his rage and thirst for revenge against this man. Thanks to the experiments carried out on Crane, he now has beastlike powers, which make him incredibly strong and help him survive in an incredibly dangerous world.</p>
<p>Kyle Crane also has to deal with juggling his intense hatred and rage towards the Baron in Dying Light: The Beast and also making sure that he doesn't step out of line and risk the lives of the survivors and factions in Castor Woods. As a result, he has to work to keep the people in Castor Woods safe while keeping his true feelings at bay.</p>
<p>With the use of beastlike powers, Kyle Crane gets to take part in some truly disgusting and intense combat while utilizing the environment around him, allowing for snappy movement and parkour, making it easy for you to navigate the various terrain types through the game, which includes forests, Swamps, cities and more.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast has already reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,000,000 wishlists</a> in less than 10 weeks, which is a testimony of the dedicated fanbase and community for this game, with Techland expressing their gratitude.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast doesn't have a specific set date for when it will be released just yet, but the game is set to release sometime in the Summer of 2025. For those interested, the game will be available to play on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Dying Light: The Beast?</p>

                <p>Game developer Hideo Kojima's Kojima Productions has at least three games in development right now, and given he's a close friend of Geoff Keighley, many expected Kojima to reveal <em>something</em> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> first galloped onto the scene in 2020, with a bombastic trailer at Gamescom 2023 showcasing some particularly beautiful medieval open world action adventuring. It's got horses, fishing, plate armour and roving heroism, but one thing it lacks is a release date. Now, thanks to The Geoff Awards, that's changed! Well, sort of - Crimson Desert is out sometime in late 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're unfamiliar with the game, you play as Kliff who explores the open world of Pywel. In said open world, you battle goblins and medieval people. You ride wyverns. Do some rock climbing, cooking, maybe a puzzle. Apparently there are "aerial Abysses" that promise "endless discovery". Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crimson-desert-in-action-looks-like-a-sort-of-janky-assassins-creedlike-where-you-explode-stuff-a-lot">thought</a> its first showing reminded her of mid-series Assassin's Creed games when "it got a bit silly". What do I think? I think it looks a bit like it's trying to do too much and, quite possibly, will succumb to this, ending in a 6/10 experience for all involved. Huh, that actually sounds quite good - I could do with more middling silliness.</p>

<p>Our James gave the game a whirl at this year's Gamescom and wasn't all <em>that</em> impressed by it. While he thought there was some spectacle in what was clearly a fight-oriented demo, said fighting felt "twangy" and "unwieldy" to him. In those brief moments outside of the sword-clanging, he described its exploration as "delightfully madcap", which sounds incredibly appealing.

Sometimes it doesn’t always translate, and you get rough performances like his role in the romantic drama <em>The Lake House</em> or the much-maligned serial killer movie <em>The Watcher</em>, which got him a Worst Supporting Actor nomination at the Razzies in 2000.

It includes a new level based on the film’s depiction of Tokyo, and has Shadow transported to this other dimension, and changing into a new form: Reeves’ version of the character from the film. His model changes, but more importantly, so does his voice. Reeves voices the hedgehog for the level, including all the grunts when he jumps and attacks, and his inner monologue. I was excited to get a sneak-peek at what Reeves might sound like playing Shadow in the movie, but his delivery in the Tokyo level reaches <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIA37nFDog&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIA37nFDog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“That Wizard came from the moon”</a></span> levels of stilted.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons this can happen.

I would not be surprised if Reeves recorded his lines for the <em>Shadow Generations </em>DLC in a single session, possibly a quick extra while he was in the booth.</p><div id="197402"><div data-video-id="197402" data-monetizable="false" data-position="kinjavideo" data-video-title="Keanu Reeves in Shadow Generations" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="7" data-playlist="197402" data-current="197402"><div><p>Keanu Reeves in Shadow Generations</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" playsinline="" poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/197xrjaz7466rpng.png" data-poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/81dea7e54127d3e9f4062e5794ba98dc.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197402/197402_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197402/197402_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197402/197402_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22940.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><figcaption>Keanu Reeves in Shadow Generations</figcaption></div><p>For example, take this line from Shadow’s inner monologue during the Tokyo level: “A beautiful city.

But I hear these lines in <em>Shadow Generations </em>and wonder just how much time Reeves spent reading this script. I can’t imagine Sega having a lot to work with if these were the takes they put in the game.

<p>Bungie’s former chief legal officer, Don Mcgowan, recently revealed that the studio hired fans as they were okay with working for a smaller paycheck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKfUWDnsE2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IATSE</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-legal-exec-studio-hired-fans-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>), McGowan, a former member of Bungie’s general counsel, discussed how gaming companies hire fans to “get away with lower pay” because they are working on a game they love. McGowan states that they “totally took advantage of that at Bungie,” adding, “We hired fans because fans would work for less.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>McGowan has also previously worked with companies like Pokemon and Microsoft Games. During the interview, he reveals how peers asked him, “How much of a pay cut are they making you take?” when he moved to Bungie. He explained that people in the industry would assume that the studio is making you take a pay cut, which is “a horrible reputation for you to have”. “But when you only hire fans, you can get away with that”, concluded McGowan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first shot at Bungie by an ex-employee this week; the former Marathon game director has also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the studio and Sony recently</a>.

		<p>Bluesky, the Twitter-but-not-Twitter social networking service that was founded by one of the original people who founded Twitter itself, is having a moment in the wake of Trump's re-election. As Twitter became a political weapon seized by Elon Musk, there was a collective breaking point that many others hit much earlier: it was time to find a new home. Maybe that home was Threads, Mastodon, or somewhere else on the internet entirely, but for a lot of people, it's been Bluesky.</p><p>Recently, Patrick made a personal shift towards checking Bluesky over Twitter, but the reason for that shift, while in the wake of [gestures at chaotic series of recent events], was actually because of an event much more subtle and personal. Patrick's also someone who's grown up in an era of the internet where social media, in some form, has felt ever-present. Rob, a few years older, had a slightly different journey.</p><p>You've probably heard enough about Bluesky at this point. We get it.</p><p>Nonetheless, here's how Rob and Patrick arrived at this moment. And no, you will not have to scroll past a picture of Musk if you read this.</p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>X/Twitter is a cesspool. It’s dangerous. It’s likely to become a weapon of the state. And yet, for too long, I have been unable to shake spending time there. I have hundreds of thousands of followers built up over more than a decade of work. I have carefully curated lists for games, politics, and sports that help inform me <em>and</em> waste my time. For a long time, it felt like Twitter was an important platform because it existed outside of my place of employment. It didn’t matter if I lost or left a job, because you could follow me on Twitter and we’d stay connected.</p><p>Habits are hard, man, and I suspect many, many people who loathe Elon Musk and what Twitter has become have, nonetheless, continued to spend time on Twitter, even if they won’t admit it.</p><p>But there was a moment a few weeks ago where, on a Discord call with Kinda Funny’s Blessing Adeoye Jr. ahead of a podcast recording, we started talking about social media habits. Blessing mentioned that he’d recently moved the Twitter app to another page on his phone, and placed Bluesky in its spot. Prior to this decision, he’d <em>wanted </em>to make the mental shift to checking Bluesky more often than Twitter, but sheer force of habit had him thumbing the ol’ Twitter app. This one simple change produced a massive change in behavior, though. Now, he was on Bluesky way more often, and spending time curating follows to make it more interesting.</p><p>I paused. Then, right then and there, I made the same change. I dumped Twitter into a folder called “social networking,” alongside Mastadon and Threads, while pushing Bluesky out. (I rarely use Mastodon and Threads, beyond crossposting my work out of convenience for others.)</p><p>Dude, the personal vibe shift was <em>immediate</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, to be fair, one of the reasons I’d held off on shifting to Bluesky was because the entire sports world remained addicted to Twitter. (It feels like elements of the reporting world started making a shift for the exits after the election was over.) But there was a moment where ESPN analyst Mina Kimes decided to make a move and start bullying all her colleagues. Then, people set up mirror accounts to follow for folks like Adam Schefter, and suddenly Bluesky was beginning to look <em>a whole lot more like my old hangout</em>, <a href="https://www.advocate.com/business/bluesky-libs-of-tiktok-suspended?ref=remapradio.com"><u>except with decent moderation policies.</u></a></p><p>Social media is bad blahblahblah. I get it. But for me, it’s the ultimate time waster, an invaluable resource for discovering stories and people to talk about for them, and my favorite way to quickly scan the news. If you squint, Bluesky doesn’t look different than Twitter, <em>which is what I wanted</em>. I hope it’s a better place, but mostly, I wanted a home I felt less guilty about visiting.</p><p>Our relationships with social media are a little different due to work, obviously, but I’m curious where you’ve ended up these days as you poke at your phone and decide where to end up.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshua_hoehne?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Joshua Hoehne</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>The worst thing about Bluesky has always been the people who think being on Bluesky is a profound act of moral and political resistance. The best thing about it has always been the way it is basically just like Twitter in its earliest incarnations, before the site’s attempts to figure out monetization increasingly chipped at the stuff people want out of a social media network: a giant, convenient water cooler hang with people who find each other interesting. Ultimately what Bluesky has needed, and finally started to get with the arrival of sports media, was a critical mass of normies who are not primarily interested in talking about politics and who do not regard their primary role on the platform as being a poster. Even now, I still notice a dichotomy between the two networks: if I want to follow news or sports I go to Twitter, if I want to actually talk about sports I post to Twitter… but most of the people I actually know are on Bluesky and the conversations I want to catch up on are happening there.</p><p>Twitter’s strength is still the huge numbers of people who just see it as the default site to find news, clips, reactions to stuff happening in cultural spaces. </p>

When discussing a possible second season, Miller admits there are too many video games to choose from, before Wilson mentions arguably the most influential video game of all time. “The one I know I want to do is if we can figure out a way, the sort of granddaddy of all video games, I need to find a way to make a <em>Pong </em>episode.”</p><p>Before any of us could conjure up all of the possible twisted angles you can take with a 2D table tennis-themed game, Miller goes straight for blood, suggesting a <em>Pong </em>episode “could be equally disturbing as <em>Pac-Man</em>.” Just to refresh your memory, the <em>Pac-Man</em>-inspired episode from the first season involved a floating golden orb training a swordsman who emerged from a tank to escape a maze, before violently taking over his body for its own mysterious aim. Does that mean the <em>Pong</em> paddles will be controlled by humans ready to lob bombs instead of an innocuous white dot back-and-forth in a game of survival? Maybe not, but Pac-Man covered in blood after eating its way into someone’s body doesn’t make that suggestion an impossibility. </p><p>Miller also calls <em>Fortnite</em> the “Moby Dick of video games,” perhaps because the vast collection of IPs now present in it would make acquiring the rights a highly attractive but also very elusive and challenging prospect, or because, in his mind, the game’s popularity and cultural ubiquity make working with the property an obvious goal for anyone involved in telling stories rooted in games right now. Either way, a second season of <em>Secret Level</em> is not promised, especially given how the first has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-level-review-amazon-playstation-pac-man-mega-man-1851716804?_gl=1*1q1pml9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDA2MzI1Ni4xMjMuMS4xNzM0MDYzNTg4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-level-review-amazon-playstation-pac-man-mega-man-1851716804?_gl=1*1q1pml9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDA2MzI1Ni4xMjMuMS4xNzM0MDYzNTg4LjYwLjAuMA..">received by reviewers</a></span>.

It takes place in Magpie Forest in 1373, 101 years after <em>The Witcher 3</em>. And in that epilogue there is a certain white-haired Witcher hunting a monster who remains unnamed, but who behaves in a certain way.”</p><p> He continued cryptically, “And obviously he has white hair. I think we can expect Geralt to be around for a long time. The capacity in which he does is…we’ll see. But I don’t think he’s going anywhere.”</p><p>The Witcher 4 probably still won’t be out for a while, but in the meantime fans can get more of Cockle’s Geralt in Netflix’s animated movie  <em>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-sirens-deep-doug-cockle-netflix-witcher-4-1851651538&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-sirens-deep-doug-cockle-netflix-witcher-4-1851651538">that arrives in February 2025</a></span>.

            <p>
This week has seen a flurry of activity within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, the game's ever-expanding corner in which several major game modes now sit. First, there was the arrival of a major update for Lego Fortnite Odyssey (the mode previously also simply known as 'Lego Fortnite') that adds the Storm King boss as a big endgame challenge, akin to the Ender Dragon in Minecraft. 
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's now a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">whole new and separate Lego Fortnite offering to explore: Brick Life</a>, a colourful mash-up of gameplay that feels like a family friendly <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> mixed with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>.
</p>
<p>
How did these changes and new features come about? And what does the future have in store for Lego and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s popular crossover? I sat down with Epic Games EVP of game development Devin Winterbottom and Remi Marcelli, SVP and head of Lego gaming at the Lego group, to find out more.

<p>
<strong>How did you come up with the new name for Lego Fortnite Odyssey? And why Odyssey?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Marcelli:</strong> Finding new brands is always a bit of a challenge for The Lego Group. Lego Fortnite is those two brands coming together, but it's not specific to a genre. At the time we chose that name, it was an obvious one just because we have two very powerful brands - it would have been a missed oppurtunity! We didn't know we would have a collection of games, potentially, that would sit under that umbrella. 
</p><p>
So what we really needed to find was one calling out the genre you'd expect to find when launching [the old] Lego Fortnite. Odyssey came about because that's what players love the most - the adventures. The adventure play is the most loved part of that game and we've dialled up that with the Storm King. 
</p>
<p>
We wanted to just make sure people understood it was an adventure game. And with Brick Life, hopefully it's self-explanatory - it says social roleplay.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Did you always know you wanted the Storm King in there? For long-term Fortnite fans, it's cool to see him come over from the game's original Save the World mode.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Winterbottom:</strong> We had a vision of what this game could become. We always wanted to have the big, scary, difficult, challenging thing you could aspire to accomplish. We always had in mind it would be something like this. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Everything we've added into Odyssey has stayed in it"</blockquote>
<p>
We arrived together at the Storm King after thinking about the kinds of things that already existed within the big thing called Fortnite and the history of where our game came from, and what we could do in this world. He is meant to be the challenging thing you aspire to do, which a game in this genre - we think it needs. 
</p>
<p>
It's really cool the way that mountain has just appeared in the middle of your island, the biome is incredible and he sits atop of it. It's a lot of fun and we expect players will play with it for years to come. 
</p><p>
The last thing I'll say is - everything we've added into Odyssey has stayed in it. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-adds-big-new-star-wars-world-this-week">Star Wars content</a> is still there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-heads-into-uncharted-territory-with-huge-lost-isles-expansion">the klombos</a>, the battle bus, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-adds-vehicles-to-drive-and-build">the vehicles</a>, the farming... and that's unique for us. It was challenging to drop this Storm King update in the middle of a live map that someone's been playing and that we've added all this other content. But we're really happy with how it's turned out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you managed to do that? Because that new area isn't just stitched onto the side, it has to detect where you've been in the world previously, what you've built to avoid ruining that stuff.</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>"We can't betray that - their work, their investment"</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Winterbottom:</strong> It's difficult technical work. Unreal Engine is an incredibly powerful tool that has a bunch of procedural world generation technology we've been building into it for the past few years. We've been working on this technology challenge for a while. 
</p>
<p>
When we did the Star Wars update we put a new biome off to the side of your island, which is a much simpler thing to do. We always had the ambition to change a person's island live, but noting that they've changed it themselves - they've erected structures all over, they've built things. We can't betray that - their work, their investment. So there's a bunch of work the engineering and design teams did to figure out how to procedurally, algorithmically find the right place for that biome and create that structure. 
</p><p>
We're really proud of that achievement, it's not easy to do, and we take players' investment in everything they have crafted on that island very seriously - because that's their game they've built inside of it, it's their creativity and we don't want to tear that down. That's how we approached it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What will 2025 look like for Lego Fortnite Odyssey? Can players expect the same mix of licensed and original content additions?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Winterbottom:</strong> We just met up and talked about exactly this! We like to have enough roadmap that we can get our teams working, but not so much that we can't react to what players are liking, because we take so much from the community in terms of feedback. 
</p>
<p>
There will definitely be, maybe, some more licensed stuff - there's fun things to do there. But we're more focused on how we continue to make the game fun. We've not just been adding content but we've been refining how it plays this year - and we plan to do both of those things next year with Odyssey. We're pretty excited about our 2025 plans.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It sounds like a game you're not expecting to finish up anytime soon. Will it ever be finished, or are you planning to keep building it indefinitely?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Marcelli:</strong> I hope it's a game that will never be finished. The Fortnite platform allows it and it's becoming a place where any game can be a live-service game pretty easily. And we talk about the limitless possibility of Lego bricks, so if you combine those things together it is indeed limitless. I hope it will never be done, always kept fresh and updated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Moving onto Lego Fortnite Brick Life, how did that come about and how did you decide on the roleplay, social sim genre to go with?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Marcelli:</strong> Roleplay was a genre the community had a lot of appetite for and if you think about the Lego Group - the first thing you do once you've built your set is to roleplay, so it made a lot of sense to embrace that genre from a video game perspective. Doing this within Odyssey wouldn't have done justice to what you can get from an adventure game and would probably have been a distraction in an adventure game - so we wanted to separate the two. 
</p><p>
Epic came with the proposal of launching another game instead of creating everything that everyone wants in one game, in order to keep the authenticity of what Lego Odyssey was at the time. We said 'let's plan for something in 2027' and they did it in one year.

<p>
<strong>How did you do it in one year?</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>"We're a little bit demanding with our brands and our bricks!"</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Marcelli:</strong> The technical work that went into building Lego Fortnite in the first place was long and deep. We just needed to have all our elements rendered to perfection because, as you can imagine, we're a little bit demanding with our brands and our bricks! [laughs]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Winterbottom:</strong> Have you noticed the word Lego is literally embossed on every brick?!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Marcelli:</strong> We wanted that Lego love, fidelity and everything. So it was a lot of work to create the archtecture, create 2000 minifigs, but once that's there it's easier to build on. So I want to commend the work Epic Games did in the past to build that architecture there in the past for us to build on in the future - but they also work fast, too.

            <title><![CDATA[The Witcher 4 Officially Unveiled by CD Projekt Red]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-4-officially-unveiled-by-cd-projekt-red.1060827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em>, previously known by its internal project codename Polaris, and it'll star Geralt's ward Ciri as she embarks on her own Witcher Path.</p>

<p>The cinematic reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>was shown during yesterday's Game Awards, where we also got reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami 2</em></a>, the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">Naughty Dog game</a>, and co-op survival spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the trailer, we see Ciri taking on a witcher contract to dispatch a monster "demanding ritual sacrifice", as CD Projekt Red says. A villager attempts to stop her going after the girl who has been chosen for sacrifice, but she angrily retorts that it wasn't the gods who chose the girl, but the villagers themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-4-announcement-sacrificial-girl.jpg?itok=6N0y8vuU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-4-announcement-sacrificial-girl.jpg?itok=WzE-luj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The debut&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>trailer shows Ciri dealing with a witcher contract in a village where ritual sacrifice is seemingly the norm.</figcaption></figure><p>We see Ciri venture into the forest where the monster lives, dispatching it in a typically&nbsp;<em>Witcher</em>-esque combat scene that feels very weighty and heavy.</p>

<p>She returns to the village with the monster's head, whereupon the girl from the beginning of the trailer apparently dies in her father's arms. The villagers say they only wanted the girl to "go to the gods", whereupon Ciri responds that "there are no gods here, there are only monsters".</p>

<p>It all looks like typically riveting, typically grounded&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>stuff, and it's nice to see Ciri taking Geralt's role as the protagonist, especially given that she seems to be a less detached and more fiery Witcher than he was.</p>




<p>In <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, CD Projekt Red says the trailer was pre-rendered using "a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU", presumably referring to the mooted 50 series, which has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>Last month, CDPR said production on the new&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">was ramping up</a>, so its announcement during yesterday's Game Awards makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The studio is promising "the most immersive and ambitious open-world&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game to date", but we still don't have a release window for it yet, unfortunately. We'll likely have to wait a while for more info, so watch this space.&nbsp;</p>

Even at its common $70 sale price, you’re entering pro controller territory. That said, a 50 percent discount for the second-gen <strong>Backbone One (USB-C)</strong> seems worth jumping over the fence for. Today only, you can get it for $49.99 at <a href="https://howl.link/m2izynfmle3vn">Best Buy</a>, which is a record low price and just in time for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264510/the-resident-evil-2-remake-is-coming-to-apple-devices-on-new-years-eve"><em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake that’s soon launching on the iPhone</a>.</p><p>The Backbone One’s USB-C connector means it works both with Android smartphones and iPhones 15 or newer. It’s sleek with a bubbly grip sized <em>just</em> right to comfortably reach any of its face buttons, triggers, bumpers, or analog sticks.

The controller also has USB-C passthrough charging and 3.5mm for headphones and headsets. </p><p>The Best Buy-exclusive <em>Warzone Mobile</em> edition on sale here is mostly a spiritual tie-in: it’s visually and functionally identical to the standard Backbone One, but comes with free in-game rewards. You can use it with any games or apps with controller support, including cloud streaming services like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/14/24269925/xbox-cloud-gaming-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-support">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">GeForce Now</a>. The purchase includes a free one-month trial of Backbone Plus ($40 a year afterward), which unlocks more app features like gameplay recording, live streaming, and Play on Any Screen (the latter enabling wired gaming on PC and tablets). You’ll also get three months of Apple Arcade ($7 a month value).</p><div><p>The Backbone One (second-gen) with USB-C can connect to Android phones and iPhones 15 or later.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-century-rgg">Project Century</a> at The Game Awards 2024 last night and Yakuza / Like a Dragon fans are already deep in the theorizing phase to figure out what the heck it actually is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-dev-rgg-studio-announces-project-century-the-game-awards-2024">The minute-and-a-half long debut trailer for Project Century</a>, which is presumably just a codename and not the final title, showed what appears to be Tokyo in 1915. But where in Tokyo? Let the theorizing begin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— VGT Gaming News (@VGTGamingNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/VGTGamingNews/status/1867400418550329762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Where is Project Century set?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans believe Project Century is directly connected to RGG Studio's other games by being set in Kamurocho, the fictional version of Tokyo's red light district at the center of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series. While its streets are obviously a far cry from the modern metropolis that is Tokyo today, a certain building seen in the trailer looks similar to a prominent location in Kamurocho.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I saw a building that looked like Shangri-la at the start of the trailer," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd1vt1/this_is_actually_insane/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user Jenkitten165 said, referencing the one at the bottom-left of the street in the image on the left, below. Shangri-La, a brothel which has appeared in various states across several Yakuza / Like a Dragon games, is on the right.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/project-1734094013379.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Project Century on the left, Shangri-La in Yakuza 4 on the right.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are differences, of course, but the shape of the building, its position on the street, the large front door, and the balcony directly above it all match. Shangri-La is also a distinctively older looking building than most in Kamurocho.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it is in fact Shangri-La, this would make the main street seen in the Project Century trailer East Taihei Boulevard, just along the road from where the Millenium Tower now stands and the home of Kobuki Drugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are still slim on Project Century but it seems similar in style to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon games, with lots of street fights and, well, actual yakuza walking around. Sticking to this theme would therefore make Tokyo's red light district, once again, a perfect setting for Project Century.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Project Century a Yakuza / Like a Dragon game?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This raises the question of canon, as while Project Century is set in 1915 and therefore 90 years before Yakuza 1, it could still be set in the same universe and timeline. The Yakuza / Like a Dragon series time hops plenty already, with prequel Yakuza 0 going back to 1988 and some cutscenes going back decades earlier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza gangs were active during this time period too, so despite its much earlier presence it could easily be about the Japanese underworld. The main family in the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series, the Tojo Clan, has never had its origins explored either, perhaps presenting an opportunity to do so here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Century could still be set within the Yakuza / Like a Dragon canon without technically being a Yakuza / Like a Dragon game, however. RGG Studio has done this before with Judgement and Lost Judgement, a series set within the same world but featuring (mostly) different characters and a different story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans even think it's linked to Judgement directly. "Genuinely think it may be Judgement: Isshin," said crazyred88 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd1viz/project_century/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. Like a Dragon: Isshin is the somewhat confusingly non-canon Yakuza / Like a Dragon game that is essentially a piece of historical fiction featuring characters from the modern setting games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's what I'm thinking too," said Shattered_Sans. "The protagonist looks similar enough. It could be to Judgement what Isshin is to Like a Dragon." This theory is backed up by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-yakuza-series-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-series-fully-going-forward">RGG Studio previously declaring Yakuza / Like a Dragon</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-yakuza-series-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-series-fully-going-forward"> its turn-based role-playing game franchise</a> and Judgement its action game franchise, and Project Century is very clearly the latter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who is the main character of Project Century?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">But is the protagonist of Project Century, presumably the man we see beating up baddies in the trailer, an alternate history version of Takayuki Yagami from the Judgement series? The trailer only shows a single shot of his face, so it's still hard to say, but some fans certainly think so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other theories exist too, of course, with the most common comparison being made between the protagonist and the actor who played protagonist Kiryu Kazuma in the 2007 live action adaptation of Yakuza / Like a Dragon, Kazuki Kitamura.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He looks like Kazuki Kitamura, who played Kiryu in the first movie," said SomeChunkyMilk on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd4u0h/this_needs_to_be_said_but_project_centurys/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. "He's my guess. The nose and the hair look pretty damn similar." FarEast_Frez chimed in too: "He's quite tall as well, which would probably help with the mocap since the character looked quite tall."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/screenshot-27-1734098446653.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This would mean he wasn't Yagami, of course, who's played by Takuya Kimura. Like a Dragon: Isshin previously brought over all the characters one for one, with the same models and voice actors and so on, so this would dissuade the Judgement Isshin theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, again, point to a completely fresh character though: the founding member of the Tojo Clan. " I wonder if it’s the first Tojo patriarch, the one who takes Kamurocho under his control and establishes the family, then later the Tojo Clan," said Hold-My-Sake on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd4u0h/this_needs_to_be_said_but_project_centurys/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. "Dude if this is legit the progenitor of the Tojo Clan I will actually eat a shoe," added Terrible_Guidance599.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Project Century a Dragon Engine game?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whoever he is, the protagonist of Project Century is much more violent than the likes of Kiryu or Yagami. Despite having beaten up thousands of people and taken down helicopters with rocket launchers and so on, Kiryu has officially never killed someone. The same can't be said after 90 seconds of this new protagonist, who's stabbing baddies with crowbars and ripping out their innards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is notable for other reasons though; the current Dragon Engine has so far been used to create Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Yakuza Kiwami 2, Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise, Judgement, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, for a total of 11 games over eight years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's therefore getting a touch outdated, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-dragon-engine-unreal-engine-5-masayoshi-yokoyama">something RGG Studio has admitted already</a>, and its technical director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-tech-chief-finally-wants-to-make-a-dragon-engine-for-high-spec-consoles">Yutaka Ito said just last month he's finally eager to make a new engine</a> for use on current consoles. All of the aforementioned Yakuza / Like a Dragon games, including the 2025 release of Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, are available on the PlayStation 4 generation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are debating whether Project Century is, or is not, a Dragon Engine game. "It's like they pushing the Dragon engine to its limit, even for RGG standard this is insane," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd1xnx/project_century_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user honoyom said, but was refuted by AnyImpression6 who thought it was Unreal Engine 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others pointed out that Project Century is already reusing animations from other RGG Studio games though, something that's fairly common practice. "Like four of the combat animations are straight from the other games too," said AppealToReason16. "I knew it was an RGG game before the name reveal at that first movement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio does make clear the trailer footage is pre-alpha, however, meaning very early in development. RGG Studio has otherwise made clear it favors the Dragon Engine for its ability to produce a realistic atmosphere for cities at night time. It could therefore make sense that, for Project Century, which doesn't feature the bright lights of modern day Tokyo, RGG Studio would be more comfortable stepping away from the Dragon Engine in favor of something more technologically advanced.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Century Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans will just have to wait patiently for answers to all of these questions. Project Century is probably still a while away given it doesn't have a title yet, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-set-to-take-on-street-fighter-and-tekken-once-again-with-virtua-fighter-the-game-awards-2024">RGG Studio is currently developing Virtua Fighter 6</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii alongside Project Century.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is known for its unbelievably speedy development times, however. In the last five years, for example, its released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last RGG Studio release</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Among other things, we learned the game will focus on Ciri as the main character. The developers at CD Projekt Red have now discussed why they wanted to have Ciri be the star and have confirmed that, as suspected, Geralt will appear in the game in some fashion.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-was-always-going-to-be-about-ciri-even-when-we-were-doing-the-wild-hunt-actually-but-dont-worry-about-geralt-definitely-hes-going-to-appear/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that it was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4 to tell its story from Ciri's perspective, building off the narrative in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1rokekgnY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4c1rokekgnY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ciri was a playable character in some parts of The Witcher 3, and executive producer Gosia Mitręga said she is "less defined as a character," which gives the developers opportunities for storytelling.</p><p>Geralt, the hero of CD Projekt's previous Witcher games, will appear in The Witcher 4 as well. Kelamba said Geralt is important to the developers and to Ciri, so he's "definitely" going to appear. His voice was heard at the very end of the game's recent trailer, but that's it so far.</p><p>"I can't tell you more, but I think the promise is enough. But we believe that this journey, this new saga, this new trilogy is definitely for her," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232"></a><figcaption>Ciri in The Witcher 4's cinematic trailer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415233,1300-4415234" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"></figure><p>As Kelamba said, The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games, which are in development alongside CD Projekt's other games, including a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel and a Witcher remake.</p><p>Recently, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle walked back his comments about Geralt appearing in The Witcher 4 after the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">"slapped" him for talking about it.</a></p><p>The game's impressive CG trailer at The Game Awards was created by Platige Image and was pre-rendered in a custom version of Unreal Engine 5 running on an "unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU." The trailer uses assets and models from the game, but is more meant to be a mood piece that aims to show "the kind of experience the game is aspiring to provide."</p>

From light family games about dancing lemurs to in-depth strategy games, and some truly exciting surprises, these are the best new games at at PAX Unplugged 2024 - read on for the games you&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;to keep an eye out for when they release this year!</p>



<h2><b>Zenith</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith.jpeg?itok=KfmLvIac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith.jpeg?itok=p_4iVpTf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>Zenith</i>, an upcoming board game from <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/54347/playpunk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayPunk</a>, immediately caught my attention with its innovative, team-based gameplay. In the game, you and a teammate play a sort of tug of war for control of the planets of our solar system against your opponents.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith-board.jpeg?itok=lgHowGKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith-board.jpeg?itok=INe4xFrU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With multi-purpose cards that you can play to gain resources, utilize special abilities, and more, I was truly engrossed during my demo play through. There’s a really nice push and pull here. Keep an eye out for <i>Zenith</i>, hitting shelves this Spring.</p>



<h2><b>Butterfly Garden</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden.jpeg?itok=lDvXumye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden.jpeg?itok=43p7SLGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another entry in the ever-growing genre of calming games about birds, gardens, and bugs, <i>Butterfly Garden</i> from <a href="https://capstone-games.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Capstone Games</a> reimplements the classic tile-laying game Indigo. Wonderfully puzzle-y, you’ll lay down tiles opening up paths for your butterflies to fly along, hoping to guide them through winding lines toward your exits.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden-board.jpeg?itok=v2SVJac6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden-board.jpeg?itok=z1Z3Jsxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fun, easy breezy, this would be a great game to play with the whole family. This should be releasing within the next few months.</p>



<h2>Crafting The Cosmos</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-crafting-the-cosmos.jpeg?itok=tjyIZHdh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-crafting-the-cosmos.jpeg?itok=tx1SmIh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>Crafting the Cosmos</i>, an upcoming game by <a href="https://www.officedoggames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Office Dog</a>, Asmodee North America’s developmental studio, is a game about taking the very essence of the universe - namely elements, gravity, and even time itself, and putting it all together to forge your own galaxy. I got the chance to play through a demo round of the game with the game’s designers David Gordon and TAM, and found the gameplay intuitive but think-y at the same time. Each turn, you’re moving colored marbles around a central track, gathering resources, and plotting them on the board. Visually stunning, this has some of the cleanest design of any game I tried at PAX Unplugged. Keep an eye out for <i>Crafting the Cosmos</i> this March!</p>



<h2>Whisker Wars</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars.jpeg?itok=ckqbkEsE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars.jpeg?itok=fIrVp1gN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Mike, Sean, and Logan from <a href="https://play.glasshousegames.co/" rel="nofollow">Glasshouse Games</a> reached out to ask if I’d be willing to try out their upcoming <i>Whisker Wars</i>, I didn’t realize I was agreeing to sit down to play a game that would so thoroughly blow me away! In <i>Whisker Wars</i>, you’ll draw cards from a central deck, each depicting adorably angry woodland creatures waging all-out medieval warfare against one another. On your turn, you’ll draw your cards, lay them face-down in front of you, and then reveal. With hidden cards and a tricky decision-tree, I can’t wait to jump back in.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars-cards.jpeg?itok=jjBkwQOE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars-cards.jpeg?itok=t7kfoCIW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is Glasshouse Games’ first game, and it’s heading to crowdfunding soon - and I’m calling it now, <i>Whisker Wars</i> and Glasshouse Games, are absolutely going to become household names.</p>



<h2>Overgrown</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown.jpeg?itok=MZk4Zt6v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown.jpeg?itok=nWnIHydG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Nature is healing! Another incredible surprise, I stumbled upon <i>Overgrown</i> completely by accident at PAX Unplugged. While my days were full of meetings, each night I walked the gaming hall looking for games to jump into. And on my second night, I happened up <i>Overgrown</i> and its creator Bryan Bell, founder of the new studio <a href="https://goodtimehat.com/" rel="nofollow">Good Time Hat</a>. In <i>Overgrown</i>, players take on the role of - get this - nature, taking over an abandoned city after some horrible disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown-board.jpeg?itok=OzwXaHBm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown-board.jpeg?itok=O_QiHrLC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the game, you’ll lay down a small empty frame upon a grid to collect resources which you’ll lay on your board in combinations to turn them into overgrowth. One of each of the three resources (water, sunlight, and soil) placed next to each other on your board combine to turn into a single tile of overgrowth, opening space back up on your board. And multiple overgrown tiles further combine into a single densely packed patch of greenery. You can also attract wildlife for bonus points. With a nice quick pace, and light puzzle placement, I was completely entranced by the game - and can’t wait for it to hit crowdfunding this year!</p>



<h2>Survivalist</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist.jpeg?itok=Rdo4g_Fb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist.jpeg?itok=Ox_p8BXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a gorgeous, stark black-and-white game design, <i>Survivalist</i> is all about surviving in the harsh wilderness. Designed by Ryan Courtney and Bob Hewitt of the newly formed <a href="https://www.homesteadnz.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Homestead Games New Zealand</a>, <i>Survivalist </i>is played over a series of seasons. You’ll spend the early game gathering useful resources, and crafting those into necessary tools, while preparing for a final showdown against the game itself.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist-card.jpeg?itok=wdYj1hjS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist-card.jpeg?itok=wBlSVShf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Designed purposefully to be difficult - and therefore show the peril of trying to make it out in the wilds - players will compete not to see who can survival the final encounter, but who can survive <i>the longest</i>. I didn’t get a chance to play through the full game, but in my brief demo I was immediately intrigued by both the seamless gameplay loop <i>and</i> the game’s one-of-a-kind artwork and design. With a planned release for early next year, this will be on my watch-list for sure.</p>



<h2>Disco Island Escape</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-disco-island-escape.jpeg?itok=_IuvTlKD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-disco-island-escape.jpeg?itok=z5ZC9vJp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is another game I happened upon while wandering the gaming area after the Expo Hall closed, and I’m so glad I did! <i>Disco Island Escape</i> designer April Mitchell taught me how to play this fun family-friendly game about dancing lemurs trying to make it off a volcanic island. In this game, you’ll draw cards and play matching colors to chart a course for yourself around the board. Bump into another lemur and you’ll send them back to the start while your lemur flips to their Groovy side, allowing them to move faster.</p>

<p>Perfect for families with kids who can handle a little bit of strategic thinking (but not too much!), <i>Disco Island Fever</i> invites players to boogie down, with each color card also sporting a dance move to encourage the kiddos to get up and dance while they play (I did not dance, sadly, as it was the end of a long day). Published by <a href="https://playhootenanny.com/products/disco-island-escape" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hootenanny Games</a>, <i>Disco Island Fever’</i>s very newly available for purchase.</p>



<h2>Malediction</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction.jpeg?itok=XS9LXwQz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction.jpeg?itok=ZJFAb3Wc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there’s the upcoming <i>Malediction</i>, a new card and miniature game by <a href="https://malediction.gg/" rel="nofollow">Loot Studios</a>. This game is the real deal, and truly one of the best new games at PAX Unplugged 2024. The elevator pitch is, essentially, <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> meets <i>Warhammer</i>. For a certain subset of our readers (myself included), I don’t have to say anything more! In <i>Malediction</i>, you’ll choose one of four factions, and build up a force of miniatures and a deck of cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction-miniatures.jpeg?itok=OT3W3oBz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction-miniatures.jpeg?itok=k_WBvf5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But here’s the fun twist, along with spells and little combat tricks, the cards in your deck also include profile cards for your miniatures - and you can’t bring them out onto the battlefield until you draw their card <i>and</i> pay the resource cost to field them. While the core boxes will come with cardboard cutouts, the game will also include the STL files needed to 3D print some of the most engaging looking models and terrain I’ve ever seen. I played an incredible demo, and took home some samples to try out more fully. Expect a full report before the game launches on GameFound!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, a co-op survival action spinoff of the wildly popular open-world action RPG, and it's due out next year.</p>

<p>The game, like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">Naughty Dog's next project</a>, was announced during yesterday's Game Awards, and a followup <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/fromsoftware-and-bandai-namco-reveal-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on the official Bandai Namco website sheds some more light on this rather odd-looking title.</p>

<p>The publisher describes&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>as a "standalone multiplayer co-op action survival game" in which players must band together to defeat a creature known only as the Nightlord. You will also be able to "go solo" in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, although it very much seems to be designed around co-op play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-giant-spider-boss.jpg?itok=Z33zjmEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-giant-spider-boss.jpg?itok=36A9FES6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a co-op-focused spinoff of the hugely popular&nbsp;action RPG.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will consist of a "three day-and-night cycle" in which you'll make "split decisions about combat and exploration" while taking down "terrifying bosses", which sounds like par for the course when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p>This time around, however, you won't be making your own characters; rather, you'll choose from an existing pool of eight, each of which has their own "unique abilities and powerful Ultimates".</p>

<p>The game will take place in the parallel realm of Limveld, where you'll face increasingly difficult bosses at the end of each night, with the third night pitting you against the "chosen Nightlord".</p>

<p>Should you fall, you'll still be granted relics that you can use to "customize and upgrade" your characters, so it sounds like <i>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</i>will have more than a whiff of the roguelite about it as well.</p>




<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s announcement comes just days after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki said the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be revisiting the IP</a> anytime soon, which feels like a particularly brazen statement in hindsight.</p>

<p>However, given the massive sales figures of both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">itself</a> and its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">expansion</a>, another game in the series was perhaps an inevitability.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox sometime next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naughty-dogs-next-game-revealed-as-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet.1060794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We finally know what Naughty Dog's new game is, and it's...well, it's pretty different to&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, by the looks of things.&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>is a sci-fi action game that's "currently in development for the PlayStation 5 console".</p>

<p>Naughty Dog announced&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>during yesterday's Game Awards ceremony, which is also where we learned that Hideki Kamiya will be returning to direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">a sequel to 2006&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-esque action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Okami</em></a>.</p>

<p>As studio head Neil Druckmann says in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup PlayStation Blog post</a>, Naughty Dog has been working on this game since it released&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2&nbsp;</em>in 2020, and it'll be the studio's "wildest, most creative story yet", according to Druckmann.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-combat.jpg?itok=l1313hPS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-combat.jpg?itok=doUQlmMb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>has been in the works at Naughty Dog since 2020.</figcaption></figure><p>Naughty Dog's new game revolves around Jordan A. Mun, a "dangerous bounty hunter" who finds herself stranded on a distant planet known as Sempiria.</p>

<p>The planet's communication with the rest of the universe "went dark" hundreds of years in the past, and Mun will have to find out why if she wants "to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit".</p>

<p>Although the debut trailer does look rather different tonally from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>(including an appearance by the excellent Pet Shop Boys album&nbsp;<em>Actually</em>, of all things), Druckmann says it'll still offer "an emotional, character-driven epic journey".</p>

<p>He also promises "the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog's history", with the studio "taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we've ever done before".</p>




<p>Mun will be played by Tati Gabrielle, who you may know as&nbsp;<em>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em>'s Prudence or the <em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>movie's Jo Braddock. Coincidentally, she'll also be appearing as Nora in the upcoming second season of the TV adaptation of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether or not this is the project on which Naughty Dog's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog" rel="nofollow">new art director Raf Grassetti</a> is working, but we do know that soundtrack duties will be handled by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, also known as Nine Inch Nails.</p>

<p>That wasn't all Naughty Dog revealed during yesterday's show, either.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>'s long-awaited PC port was also finally unveiled, and it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hitting Steam</a> on April 3rd.</p>

<p>We likely won't hear much from&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>for a while; Naughty Dog says its staff will "put our heads back down" to work on the game "for now", so stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <p>Stealth launching a game during an awards ceremony is cool. But you know what's cooler? Stealth launching a union. As many in the games industry settled in for an evening of advertisements and blockbuster backslapping, one group of US workers quietly succeeded in organising something of their own. Employees at Zenimax Online Studios launched their union with 461 members, as announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhpai6226">on social media site Bluesky</a> last night. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The members include engineers, artists, web developers, and game designers. Most of these workers are based in Maryland, say the union, but others are spread across the states, in California, New York, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Texas. </p>
<p>"With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace," they say, "including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits – in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about."</p>
<p>That mention of "job security" is the obvious concern, given the grave number of layoffs in recent years, thousands of which have fallen upon Microsoft-owned studios. Zenimax Online Studios are the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>, and are themselves owned by the Windows peddlers.</p><p>Microsoft has officially recognised the union, but you should know that a labour agreement following the big fat Activision Blizzard acquisition last year essentially means that they do this because they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-ahead-of-activision-blizzard-deal">are required to do so</a>. Which partly explains why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">Zenimax QA workers</a> have also been able to recently unionise with perhaps more ease than a studio under another company.</p>
<p>The Zenimax Online union that arose last night has been formed under the Communication Workers of America, a parent union that has been organising workers across the states for some years now. Earlier this year that parent group also helped another band of Elder Scrolls developers at Bethesda Game Studios to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">form their own union too</a>, consisting of 241 workers. </p>
<p>"We're working against some pretty massive corporations," a CWA organiser told Nic when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">spoke to them recently about their organising campaign</a>.“The imbalance of power is very obvious. So you try to organise in secret so that people can't be totally derailed from exercising their rights before they even have a chance to understand those rights.”</p>
<p>I can think of no greater sneak attack than doing it as soon as Geoff Keighly gets up on stage. Nice work. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-esports-rumour/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumour-riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-for-league-and-valorant-teams-in-2025.1060788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-esports-rumour/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed that Riot Games is preparing to make a major change to its sponsorship policies as we head into 2025. It was recently rumoured that the company will allow a limited number of gambling companies to sponsor esports teams in League of Legends and VALORANT, after spending many years standing firm against that very concept.</p>



<p>Most recently, in 2023, the gaming titan issued a statement confirming that there were no plans to change these policies <strong>but </strong>it would continue to ‘evaluate all opportunities’ in the sponsorship space. </p>



<p>Is a cultural shift on the horizon?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-the-money-is">Where The Money Is</h2>



<p>Esports betting makes up around half of the industry’s total revenue, while the other half is comprised of ticket sales, sponsorship deals, broadcast rights, merchandise sales, and other investments. It’s a money maker of a business, and that’s why so many esports organisations partner with gambling and betting brands.</p>



<p>On social media, the user ‘MonteCristo’ posted a claim that Riot will alter long-standing policies to allow betting sponsors to align with League of Legends and VALORANT teams going into 2025:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Riot will be allowing esports teams to have betting sponsors in League of Legends and VALORANT in 2025.

Gambling companies interested in sponsoring teams will have to be approved by Riot and will not be allowed to place logos on team uniforms.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, some of the most prolific brands in esports betting have partnered with or sponsored organisations. The likes of GG.BET, Pinnacle, Betway, Parimatch, and 1xBet have all secured visible positions in the esports industry alongside some of the most valuable tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>It’s not too far-fetched to imagine that Riot Games wants in on that action, but it would come at the cost of some morality points.</p>



<p>For now, this is a rumour and should be treated accordingly, but I have reached out to representatives of Riot Games to try and grab a more concrete statement on the matter.</p>



<p>What do you think of this rumour? Can you see it materialising? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Workers at ZeniMax Online Studios have voted to unionise.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-announces-okami-2-hideki-kamiya-to-direct.1060758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During yesterday's Game Awards, Capcom announced a sequel to cult classic 2006 action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, and it boasts the involvement of one of the original game's most important figures.</p>

<p>In a brief trailer shown during the Game Awards, Capcom confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Okami 2</em>, which is currently known simply as "<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>Sequel", is officially in the works, and that original director Hideki Kamiya will return to direct the project.</p>

<p>The game's <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/o-kami_newproject/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new official website</a> sheds a little more light on the project too, although it doesn't give much away. According to the site,&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is being developed by "studios that include various staff members of the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>", including M-Two, Machine Head Works, and Kamiya's own Clovers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=MzvqDwD6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=aDf7wS6v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is officially coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Capcom says it "will be some time" before we get more information about Amaterasu's latest adventure, but that the studio "really hope[s] you look forward to this project". I can only speak for myself, but I'm absolutely hyped for this.</p>

<p>The trailer itself is fairly brief as well. It features Amaterasu herself sprinting across a field while&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>'s distinctive music plays, and she's trailing beautiful flowers behind her, just like in the original game.</p>

<p>We then see a flower with closed petals as a paintbrush traces a thick ink circle around the flower, upon which it suddenly bursts into bloom. It's a reference to a paint gesture in the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, in case you haven't played it.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>here. I don't know about you, but just seeing this minute or so of footage made me weirdly emotional.</p>




<p><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't all Capcom revealed during the Game Awards, either.</p>

<p>As well as a revival of one classic PS2 franchise, we're also getting another in the form of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, a hack-and-slash action game that looks like it owes more than a small debt to FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>.</p>

<p>Reviving&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense given that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-onimusha-anime-trailer" rel="nofollow">animated series based on the games</a>&nbsp;debuted late last year. You can check the trailer out for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>We'll bring you more on both&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, as well as everything else Capcom is up to right now, as soon as we get it. Stay tuned.</p>

See you on the path.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-debut-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms-single-player-open-world-action-rpg-the-game-awards-2024">Ciri is confirmed as the main character for The Witcher 4</a>, fans were left wondering whether Geralt would appear in the game, which is set after the events of The Witcher 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can confirm that Geralt is indeed in The Witcher 4, and that is indeed the voice of veteran Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle. Confirmation comes from CD Projekt itself, which told IGN: "Geralt will appear in the game, but we don’t want to spoil his role precisely. You’ll have to wait to learn more for now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, how can Geralt appear in The Witcher 4 after The witcher 3 left the character in semi-retirement at his vineyard in Toussaint? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-the-lore-you-need-to-know">In an interview with IGN ahead of the reveal of The Witcher 4</a>, CD Projekt franchise and lore designers Cian Maher and Marcin Batylda explained how the already established timeline of events makes it make sense.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean Geralt will probably be around for a long time to the extent that in Season of Storms, the prequel novel that takes place actually before Geralt attends that banquet we mentioned earlier on, there is an epilogue in that book,” Maher explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It takes place in a place called Magpie Forest in 1373, 101 years after The Witcher 3. And in that epilogue there is a certain white-haired witcher hunting a monster who remains unnamed, but who behaves in a certain way and obviously he has white hair. So by which I mean I think we can expect Geralt to be around for a long time. The capacity in which he does is, we'll see, but I don't think he's going anywhere.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/gettyimages-1356685274-1733820615489-1734093558556.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Doug Cockle had insisted The Witcher 4 was a mystery to him.

That is itself a fun follow-up to recent comments made by Doug Cockle, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">who said he “got slapped” by CD Projekt for saying Geralt is in The Witcher 4 but not as the main character</a> before the developer had a chance to make its official announcements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, ‘We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything,’ " Cockle said, before adding: “The truth is I can’t answer the question because I’ve signed an NDA. So even if I did know, I’d have to lie to you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has loads of exclusive features on The Witcher 4, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-reds-plans-for-its-next-big-rpg">Inside The Witcher 4: CD Projekt Red’s Plans For Its Next Big RPG</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-12-vital-trailer-details-revealed-by-cd-projekt-red">The Witcher 4: 12 Vital Trailer Details Revealed by CD Projekt Red</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-developer-cd-projekt-explains-why-it-went-with-ciri-over-continuing-with-geralt-as-protagonist">Why CD Projekt Went With Ciri Over Continuing With Geralt as Protagonist</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
