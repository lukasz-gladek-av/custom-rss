            <p>
Right, here's your prescribed dose of actual nice news in the games industry for the week. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is back from the dead! Despite a decade's worth of development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">the game was canned</a> with Hypixel Studios forced to completely shutter. Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">did say he wanted to talk to previous owner Riot about re-acquiring Hytale</a>, and as it turns out, that's exactly what he did!
</p>
<p>
"A new and exciting chapter for Hytale begins today," begins a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">blog post</a> from the Hytale Team. "We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games. While it didn't make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what's best for players, and that's for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible."
</p>
<p>
The good news continues on from here, as apparently more than 30 developers "who know this game inside and out" have been rehired, "with additional returns expected in the coming days. Together, we are going back to the original vision for Hytale. We are fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years." Gosh, ain't that just a nice thing to read for once?
</p>
<p>
Said blog post outlined a few behind the scenes bits too. For one, the game has switched back to the Legacy Engine it was being made on previously, with the game now being playable and the post explaining that it "lets us build a game rather than an engine. It's the version that feels like what Hytale was supposed to be."
</p><p>
In the coming days, an early access date will apparently be announced, and pricing alongside that. Setting some expectations, the post notes that early access will take at least a few years, and that at launch the game will only feature exploration mode, creative mode, and modding - no minigames or adventure mode, but they are both still planned. Good luck with it all, Hytale team!

              <p><span>The PlayStation 5 is officially five years old. In the half a decade since the console was released, Sony has become a pretty different company in terms of the games it puts out, prioritizing prestige narratives and live-service forever games, and it hasn’t quite worked out for the company. Despite this, the PS5 still has a lot of spectacular games, and with the fifth anniversary here, we figured it was time to update our list of the best games you can buy on the PlayStation Store right now.</span></p> <p><span>This time, we decided to make some sweeping changes to the list. The last time we updated our best PS5 games roundup, it had several holdovers from the original 2020 launch. So when we looked at it this week, we figured it was time to drop a lot of those early games. That’s not to say those games aren’t great, but a lot of real bangers have come out in the past year, and we’re finally out of the cross-gen era in which games landing on PS5 were often still coming out on the PS4 as well. So now we have a pretty comprehensive list of games that are actually PS5 games, rather than up-rezzed PS4 ones. You’ll still see a few bangers from early on in the PS5’s life on this list, though.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Without further ado, here are our picks for the best games you can pick up on PS5.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter</a> was a fantastic take on the roguelike that asked “but what if also capitalism?” and then did its utmost to make that fun. Fun capitalism is a nice change of pace for a lot of us, and the fact that it was all built around a lovely-looking action roguelike with a solid story was all part of the package. And what could be more capitalist than meeting market demands with the supply of a sequel? So here’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/02/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-has-been-delayed-until-november/">Moonlighter 2 opening up its stall in Early Access this week</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Early Access Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OW4qJKKAr_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is a pretty drastic change in a lot of ways, and yet remains very familiar in others. In terms of familiarity, you’re still going to be going adventuring during the night to collect relics to sell, while also trying to progress through dungeons, and you’ll still be setting up shop during the day and trying to find the perfect price for moving as much product as possible. That’s all still good stuff, and in terms of the general loop, it’s unchanged.</p>


<p>What has changed though, is basically everything else. Combat feels a little more intense now, with you being able to equip a few different weapon types which you can upgrade and unlock as you go along. Each weapon has normal attack and a light attack, and often a special property or two as well. You can also dodge, as you’d expect, but also knock enemies away with your bag, and even pull out a gun and just shoot stuff. That’s all quite fun, but it does feel a little clunky at times.</p>


<p>That’s usually because of the scenery. Some aspects of the maps you’ll be journeying around feel like they’re bigger than they look. This results in times where you’ll find yourself caught between different environmental parts, but it doesn’t look like you should be. This extends into anywhere you end up walking, and as you will be doing a fair bit of that, that’s kind of an issue. I came across some other little glitches as well, like people being invisible in my shop and enemies just stopping randomly for no reason. These weren’t game-breaking, but they were immersion-tearing. These didn’t happen often, but they did happen.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault. Your main quest is to earn a bunch of money to satisfy a space cube and unlock new features, but you’ve also got a constant slew of side quests to undertake and complete that can help you get to grips with the game or unlock new features. This is still an Early Access release, but there’s plenty to sink your teeth into. You can also upgrade yourself by using materials, build new weapons after finding recipes in the dungeons, and unlock new bits for your shop too. That all uses the same general materials, and often a lot of money, so you get lots of fun decisions to make.</p>

<p>I don’t love the new visual style, sadly. It’s something I’ve seen a number of roguelite sequels go through, including the likes of Wizard of Legend 2, where the successor insists on going a bit bigger and more ambitious with the graphics. I don’t think it’s all that necessary in Moonlighter 2’s case, as it jumps from pixel art style to 3D. The older art style was really charming, and while this game does look nice, it feels a little more sterile comparatively.</p>
<p>On the whole, I’m enjoying Moonlighter 2’s Early Access release. It’s a decent mechanical upgrade over the original game in the majority of areas, but it’s also fair to say that it’s losing a little something in the transition, and I find it a bit less whimsical. If you want more stuff to do and love a meta-grind though, then this game should satisfy that nicely.</p>

              <p>During a recent appearance at a video game convention, <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-unfair-a-q-a-with-nier-automatas-director-1795653562"><em>NieR: Automata</em> creator Yoko Taro</a> addressed complaints and jokes from some fans online saying that the enigmatic creator hasn’t put out any big new games in years. According to Taro, it’s not from lack of trying, but instead due to frequent cancellations.</p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">As reported by <em>Automaton Media</em></a> and <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, over the weekend in Korea, <a href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-mask-nier-automata-emil-lost-anime-expo-2023-1850603039">Yoko Taro (who always wears a mask in public)</a> and <em>Bayonetta </em>director Hideki Kamiya took part in a panel discussion at G-CON 2025. The two game makers talked about game development, design, and their creative processes.&nbsp; At one point, the two game developers were asked to share some information on their latest game projects, and while Kamiya mentioned work was going well on the previously announced <em>Okami</em> sequel, Taro didn’t have much to share because his projects kept getting canceled.</p>

 <p>“I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>NieR</em></a>?’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development,” said Taro.</p>

 <p>“I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released.”</p>

 <p>Taro wasn’t too sad about all the canned projects, though, explaining that he is staying optimistic and telling the convention-goers that he’d rather fail many times if it leads to making something good rather than releasing a bunch of not-so-great games.</p> <p>“I don’t view [the cancellations] as a negative thing,” explained Taro. “I believe that if I’m going to release something weird, I’d be better off not releasing anything at all.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I know there’s no point in getting heated about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>the Game Awards</span></a><span> every year, but the 2025 nominations are really making this year’s event feel like it’s gonna be the </span><a href="https://theonion.com/taco-bells-five-ingredients-combined-in-totally-new-way-1819564909/"><span>Taco Bell of award ceremonies</span></a><span>. By that, I mean it feels like every category’s nominations are made up of the same five or so games. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei </span></i><span>were eating, but pretty much anything else got snubbed. But I’m not here to yell about games, actually. I’m here to call attention to one of the most egregious snubs of the show, which is found in a non-game category. Specifically, where the hell is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a><span> in the Best Adaptation category?</span></p> <p><span>Best Adaptation was added to the Game Awards’ categories in 2022, rewarding TV and film adaptations of video games for finally getting off of the Uwe Boll assembly line and sometimes being things worth watching. Now that pretty much every company from Nintendo to Sony is trying to get into streaming services and multiplexes, it’s a worthwhile category to have at a video game award show. However, the 2025 Adaptation category is so vile in its inclusions and omissions that it’s enough to make a hedgehog vow to destroy the world for his dearly departed best friend.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000007812" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000007812"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000007812">© Paramount</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This year’s nominees range from forgettable to absolute dogshit. Here’s what we’re working with:</span><i></i></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><i><span>A Minecraft Movie</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417"><i><span>Devil May Cry</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-anime-netflix-2000619516"><i><span>Splinter Cell Deathwatch</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661"><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, Season Two</span></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/until-dawn-movie-trailer-rami-malek-wendingo-dr-hill-1851739047"><i><span>Until Dawn</span></i></a></li> </ul> <p><span>First of all, don’t even get me started on </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>season two; you can read </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-7-finale-recap-abby-jesse-1851782357"><span>literally thousands of words</span></a><span> I wrote on it earlier in the year. Meanwhile, </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i><span>, the movie that currently holds the </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3"><span>highest Rotten Tomatoes score of any video game adaptation</span></a><span>, is nowhere to be seen. There are a few reasons this probably happened. The cinematic adaptation of </span><i><span>Sonic Adventure 2 </span></i><span>came out last December, just late enough to miss the 2024 awards but still be eligible for the 2025 ceremony. That’s long enough for the jury to have forgotten that the movie could compete for the prize, and for stinkers like </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>to be top of mind. This is an especially heinous oversight given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><span>Very Bad </span><i><span>Knuckles </span></i><span>Paramount+ show</span></a><span>, which sidelined the actual </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters for the most obnoxious of its human originals, was nominated in 2024.</span></p> <p><span>Part of getting past the whole “putting stock in award shows” phase of your life is recognizing that they are often merely reflections of what the jury actually got around to. That’s likely why 2025’s nominees, rather than representing the breadth of the medium, wound up being so many of the same games over and over again. Some of the categories, such as Accessibility and Esports, are voted on by a jury of experts, while a lot of the rest are more generalized, which often keeps the more niche games, like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><span>the IMO obvious GOTY contender </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a><span>,</span> <span>from getting the nods they deserve. And sometimes you just get weird oversights, like </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i><span> missing out on a nomination for Best Adaptation, while Jack Black saying “Chicken jockey!” gets to cosplay as a good film for a night. God, </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>season two is going to win, isn’t it? I gotta lie down. Keanu Reeves didn’t deserve this.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has broken a very impressive record following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 nominations</a>. The game, nominated for Game of the Year, leads a stellar list of other contenders, including Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>







<p>Releasing earlier this year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 blew many out of the water. Not only did it look gorgeous for an indie game, but the turn-based RPG combat felt reminiscent of classic Final Fantasy and Persona. It quickly became <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-now-2025s-highest-rated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s best-reviewed title</a> for a time before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> overtook it a month ago. Still, it was pretty clear the game would make an appearance at The Game Awards in big categories. However, its nominations prove it’s showing up in a huge way, more than any other year.</p>

                <p>The city-building RTS Anno 117: Pax Romana had barely been released when sharp-eyed fans noticed the tell-tale signs of AI artwork in one of the loading screens. But rather than deny it, publisher Ubisoft has promised that it will replace the artwork in an upcoming update.</p><p>The image in question was first spotted by a user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ow3v75/the_ai_background_art_is_pretty_low_quality/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, as seen below. The scene is set at a Roman banquet, and the background elements and characters feature some common AI mistakes including misshapen faces and bodies that don't line up to human physiology. It may not even be the only AI pic in the game, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> has pointed out another image that has a pair of Roman senators who are <a href="https://imgur.com/g6SxNQb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">missing their heads</a>.</p><p>An Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/while-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-acknowledges-deliberate-ai-use-ubisoft-pledges-to-remove-ai-image-that-slipped-through-to-anno-117s-final-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the initial version of the banquet art was meant to be replaced in the final version of the game.</p><p>"This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process," said the Ubisoft spokesperson. "The final image ... will replace the current version of this artwork with the upcoming 1.3 patch."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4604107-anno117paxromanareplacement.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4604107" data-ratio="0.56041666666667" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4604107-anno117paxromanareplacement.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4604107"></a><figcaption>The updated and revised version of the pic that will be added to Anno 117: Pax Romana.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4604107-anno117paxromanareplacement.jpg"></figure><p>As seen above, the final image appears to be a retouched version of the AI pic. That makes the origin of the picture less obvious. Ubisoft has acknowledged that other AI tools were used for "for iterations, prototyping, and exploration." Regardless, the company stresses that the final version of the game "reflects the team's craft, artistry, and creative freedom."</p><p>This isn't the only game that's been recently called out over AI. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> apparently used AI to make the game's "Ghibli-style" Calling Cards. Activision subsequently acknowledged that some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">AI was used in the creation of Black Ops 7</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-finally-on-steam-and-nobody%E2%80%99s-happy.1356244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>’s efforts to move on from its early access period and become a full release have not gone smoothly. Steam users lament a variety of concerns with the new 1.0 release, from gripes over the pricing of different versions to complaints that just launching the game is a laborious and frustrating process.</p> <p>On November 15, hardcore extraction shooter <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> saw two notable events occur. Firstly, it emerged from a beta status, which it was in for over eight years, into the full, official 1.0 release. And secondly, it arrived on Steam. Unfortunately, as the game’s director <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/steam-launch-user-reviews">Nikita Buyanov seems to have anticipated</a>, user reviews on the platform have met the game with scorn, dragging the overall rating into “Mixed” status for its English reviews.</p>

 <p>“[It’s] one of the most premium pieces of launcher software I have ever purchased,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198157204571/recommended/3932890/">reads one</a> of the top “Most Helpful” negative reviews on Steam. “Great hardcore experience, it already starts with trying to launch the game – 10/10” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035754009/recommended/3932890/">a cleverly disguised “positive” review</a> in the same category. That critique doesn’t seem to be an overreaction either, as several other reviews cite an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/snoygg/recommended/3932890/">hours-long struggle</a> just to get into the game.</p>

 <p>These launch issues follow recent turmoil within the game’s community over the fact that the Steam version would <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-arena-steam-epic-unheard-edition-2000626063">require a separate purchase</a> for those who already owned the game. And <i>that </i>controversy came fresh after developer Battlestate Games faced tough criticism over <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-refund-voucher-1851490315">a controversial $250 version of the game</a>. Like your average game of <i>EFT</i>, it’s messy.</p> <p><i>Tarkov</i>’s tough-as-nails gameplay will probably always appeal to a select and discriminating group of shooter aficionados. Still, this poor reception arrives with some unfortunate timing as the extraction shooter genre has seemingly never been more popular; <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ persistent status in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">top three most-played games</a> on Steam and the wide appeal of <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588"><i>Escape from Duckov</i></a> speak to a rise in popularity, one in which genre pioneer <i>EFT</i> feels notably left out of the conversation.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes have released ahead of its November 18th release. The notes include a new map and mode, aim assist features, and plenty of bug fixes.</p>







<p>The update plans to add a ton of stuff and fixes to Battlefield 6. In terms of new content, a Southern California-inspired map, called Eastwood, will be available. Included with the map is a new limited-time mode focused on destruction aptly called Sabotage, as well as two new weapons: the M357 Sidearm and DB-12 Shotgun. </p>



<p>As for fixes, the biggest change addressed in the Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes is to the Aim Assist. According to the developers, it has reverted the tuning back to how it was during the Open Beta. Other fixes include weapon accuracy, gadget improvements, and smoother responses for controllers. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-for-this-thursday-will-feature-007-first-light-reanimal-and-more.1356226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025 nominees</a> being announced, Microsoft and Xbox revealed that it is hosting an Xbox Partner Preview later this week on November 20, 2025. The show will feature games from Xbox's third-party partners, including IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">showing off more of 007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/">Tarsier Studios showing off more of Reanimal.</a></p>



<p>The preview event will take place at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT on Thursday, November 20, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok, though Xbox doesn't say how long it will be.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re excited to reveal that the next Xbox Partner Preview – our broadcast that shines a light on upcoming games from our talented third-party partners – is coming this Thursday, November 20,</em>" <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/17/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-announce/?ocid=Evergreen_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_11.17.1">a post on Xbox Wire reads</a>. "<em>This show will include news on upcoming games from partners including IO Interactive, Tencent and THQ Nordic, plus some brand-new reveals and Game Pass announcements</em>."</p>



<p>We know that both 007 First Light and Reanimal are aiming to release sometime in 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-reanimal-release-date-q1-2026/">the latter of which is still missing a specific release date</a>. So it's probably safe to say we won't be hearing about games that are going to hit shelves before the end of this year, with this preview event focused more on games arriving in 2026, more specifically, the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>Tides of Annihilation getting a mention in the Xbox Wire post is interesting, since we've not seen much of that game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/">since earlier this year when Wccftech spoke to the development team</a>. Perhaps we'll finally learn of the game's release date in this showcase. Overall, hopefully the show has one or two interesting announcements for those tuning in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A moment many fans have been waiting for is almost here as <em>The Mighty Nein</em>, Critical Role's second campaign, makes its way to Prime Video. Ahead of its release, we got to watch the season and see how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow">Critical Role's second campaign</a> has been adapted to streaming services, how the titular Mighty Nein have come together, and how the campaign has been reshaped to best fit its new format.</p>

<h2>Forming The Mighty Nein And A World On The Edge</h2>

<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> starts with a bang as the Luxon Beacon is stolen. The Luxon Beacon is an object of great importance to the Kryn Dynasty, not just because of it's power or use in religious ceremony, but it is a relic integral to the cycle of rebirth that is a core aspect of their society.</p>

<p>These first five minutes are the perfect hook, demonstrating not only the importance of the item, but also the skill that the strange thieves with tattooed arms and powerful magical abilities are required to possess to get away with this heist, and why it's disappearance is about to trigger a war that our heroes will very quickly find themselves embroiled with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-magic.jpg?itok=ixrud_Ym 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-magic.jpg?itok=sq8TvAjc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wizards in The Mighty Nein crafting sigils is one of the best demonstrations of magic I've seen in animation</figcaption></figure><p>It was fascinating watching a wordless sequence filled with a variety of magical abilities and spells cast, every one an easter egg for Critical Role and Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, as wizards weave signs in midair to cast silence or trigger magical explosions.</p>

<p>The opening three episodes serve as the uniting of the party, we get to meet Caleb and Nott - one searching for magical components to find a familiar and the other searching for a way to keep their bottle filled - Fjord is tasked to protect Jester as she needs to escape Nicodranis, Beau is investigating an attack on the Cobalt Soul, and Mollymauk is already present at the circus that brings them all together.</p>

<p>The character's look and aesthetics are perfect from the get-go. After looking forward to seeing Caleb, Beau, Jester, and more all animated the team at Titmouse have absolutely nailed it. That being said even faithful character designs can't save the first three episodes from being the worst that the season has to offer.</p>

It robs us of getting a chance to really get to know much about the team, but it does begin the slow feed of information into the backstories of the Nein and how they all will lead them back to the Beacon.</p>

<p>It's an interesting juxtaposition from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fba9665-9011-4fc8-bf7e-3873de998554" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend Of Vox Machina</em></a> which started with the party already (in)famous, and how they rose to greatness. Here we get to see the origins of the Nein before they came together, including their back stories and plenty of additional information that would only be revealed far later in the campaign.</p>

<h2>Early Adventures</h2>

<p>After those first three episodes, the party is together, and this is where the story really takes off. The focus of this initial season is on the party getting together, establishing Trent as a big-bad of the series, and telegraphing some major moments to be coming to Season 2.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-frumpkin.jpg?itok=X3XrWXAS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-frumpkin.jpg?itok=C2nPjg2p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fans of Caleb will be happy to hear that him and his relationship with the Volstruckers is a key aspect of this first season. Unlike the campaign, where this information is dripfed over months worth of gameplay in <em>The Mighty Nein</em> we get to really revel in it all.</p>

<p>It was incredible to see so many detailed secrets from Caleb's past laid out, this structural change does leave other characters on the sideline, but does a fantastic job to really focus on what makes Caleb the damaged fire wizard that we all know and love him as.</p>

<h2>Changes From Critical Role Campaign 2</h2>

<p>The biggest change that will disappoint people, is just how little Ashley Johnson's Yasha is in this season. We get brief flashes of her across different episodes, and one deep action sequence, but unfortunately aside from that she's primarily absent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau.jpg?itok=DCS8-dTt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau.jpg?itok=K3AqYUmq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Where Caleb's back story gets explored earlier, Yasha was even removed from the Circus where she was originally found to better set her up for her role in later seasons.</p>

<p>While I won't spoil them a number of the other major changes are partial retcons of moments in the original adventure that can now be filled in with different elements of the extended Exandria lore that has been further developed through future Campaigns and One-Shots. If you were a fan of seeing Xerxes in<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="42a53bd9-3ace-4e7e-b9b3-8cb0409963bc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow">Vox Machina</a></em>, then you'll have a few massive treats to look forward to in this.</p>

<h2>Easter Eggs In Blink And You'll Miss Them Moments</h2>

<p>Fans of Critical Role will want to keep a very close eye on the different scenes as there's all manner of easter eggs and references that will pop up in the background. It's a fun reward and hat tip to those who are watching <em>The Mighty Nein</em> after consuming <em>Vox Machina </em>or the Actual Play. It also gives the show a unique sense of rewatchability as you'll get to see the story for the first time to enjoy a story about found family and magical hijinx, and then rewatch it to spot some kind of delicious-looking dust in the background.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau-investigating.jpg?itok=hvlaHrCn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau-investigating.jpg?itok=7vIdYn1Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> Season 1 is everything that I hoped that it would be and more. Even after a slow initial group of episodes once the party is together they absolutely hit the ground running.</p>

<p>While you might find a lot different in the plot, in focusing on specific characters or revealing story elements far earlier than you might expect, it's all been very smartly reformatted to a season's worth of TV.</p>

<p>As with every season of Critical Role's TV shows, now the worst part is waiting for more to release. With Season 4 of The Legend of Vox Machina releasing next year at least there's not too long to wait for that.</p>

        <p>In this games industry? Who's surprised</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been a while since Yoko Taro has made a game, hasn't it? That last public (key word here) thing he worked on was a mobile game about how Sega controls pretty much everything called 404 Game Re:set in 2023 (it shut down in 2024). Before that was a trio of Voice of Cards games in 2021/22, and before that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-replicant">Nier Replicant</a> not-quite-a-remake and also now defunct mobile game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-reincarnation">Nier Reincarnation</a>. In terms of the big thing that everyone wants, a non-gacha <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> game, things have been very quiet, but that can be said of Taro's work as a whole. Apparently, though, that's not for lack of trying.
</p>
<p>
The developer recently made an appearance at Korean video game convention G-CON 2025, where alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> director Hideki Kamiya he spoke of his approach to game design (via <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/">4Gamer</a>, translations by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">Automaton</a>). On the topic of this idea that he's not working right now, Taro had this to say: "I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to NieR’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development." Ah. That's a tad awkward, and upsettingly common.
</p>
<p>
"I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day," Taro continued. "I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released."
</p>
<p>
I would like to be very clear here that I have no idea what Taro may have been working on, and what the status of a hypothetical Nier game might currently be. But, if you're the kind of person that likes to have a moan at game devs on Vitter, maybe cut Taro some slack. And maybe do that for literally everyone, actually.

		<p>I write this from a hotel across the street from the local Buffalo airport a few hours before my flight. The last 36 hours have a whirlwind of breweries, terrific conversations, too much light beer, learning local football cultural customs, and so much more. It has been a delight. Buffalo, <em>thank you</em>. I'm sorry that our meetup didn't come together sooner, which I know meant some folks couldn't make it because the plans were solidified late. (We even had to move the venue last second, because it could not accommodate everyone who was coming, and some folks slipped through the cracks that way, despite my best efforts.) In truth, this trip wasn't going to happen. I didn't think Rob could make it for personal reasons, the government shutdown was making air travel increasingly hairy, and so I figured: well, maybe next year. While the planning could have been tighter, I'm so glad we pulled it off anyway, because I can absolutely <em>guarantee</em> you that we're going to do more of this in the future. </p><p>P.S. We talked about going to Philly next fall. </p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – I brought my recorder for interviews with me, and along the way, recorded a few brief travelogue entries about my (short) time in Buffalo, alongside an hourlong conversation with Rob after the game was over.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>RV There Yet?</em> – Look, Danika and I had so much fun that it's time to get an even bigger group going in this game. Current plan is me, Danika, Rob, and Chia. Danika didn't have to deal with the nightmare that is piloting that RV, so I am very much looking forward to Rob and Chia getting upset.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – God willing, all of us will be back together again. (I will say that I do not think the five-person format will continue to be this common in the future. We'll probably use the extra folks as a way to give people an opportunity to, say, do some extra writing that's been tough to get together.)</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW </em>– No clue what's coming out this week, so we'll be rolling the dice (or the wheel?) on what we're playing on Thursday.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Pretty good chance we talk about Buffalo!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-survey-says-most-players-around-the-world-prefer-single-player-games.1356211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Data from a new global survey involving over 30,000 gamers spread across 20+ markets shows that, overall, people who play games prefer single-player over multiplayer. However, digging into the data reveals some interesting differences between countries like Germany and China, as well as how age plays a factor.</p> <p>On November 17, Ampere Analysis published the results of a large-scale video game survey focusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/look-single-player-people-are-just-better-5826946">single-player vs. multiplayer games</a>. The research and marketing firm asked 34,428 people who have played a video game in the last year if they agreed with this statement: “I prefer single-player games over multiplayer games.” And the newly released data shows that gamers in most countries do.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644930">©Ampere Analysis</figcaption></figure> <p>In the United States, Ampere’s data revealed that 65 percent of gamers prefer single-player, making it the country with the highest number of solo-leaning players. Right behind the United States is Japan at 63 percent, Thailand at 62 percent, and Germany at 60 percent. Meanwhile, a slightly lower number of United Kingdom gamers, 58 percent, prefer single-player over online gaming.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, China and Sweden are the two countries that don’t prefer single-player, according to this survey. 47 percent of players in China and 49 percent in Sweden prefer single-player, meaning more than half would rather log on and play with friends or randos.</p>

 <h2>Multiplayer is more popular with younger gamers</h2> <p>Digging into the data more, Ampere says that gender didn’t play much of a factor, with 55 percent of men and women preferring single-player over multiplayer. On the other hand, age did play a major factor in the survey.</p> <p>According to the firm’s data, only 49 percent of 16-to 24-year-olds prefer playing by themselves. Preference for single-player adventures jumps up to 56 percent when you reach the 25-to-34-year-old range. Meanwhile, 64 percent of gamers aged 55 or older prefer single-player titles.</p>

 <p>This isn’t very shocking to hear, as free games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Roblox </em>and <em>Fortnite</em> have become extremely popular</a> with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352">kids and teens who might not be able to afford playing $70+ single-player games</a>. They also likely have more free time to coordinate online sessions with pals, whereas anyone over the age of 30 will be able to share stories of how damn hard it is to get a few friends online to play anything.</p> <p>One thing to keep in mind: Just because this survey and <a href="https://kotaku.com/survey-data-study-53-percent-gamers-singleplayer-pvp-1851665722">others show that a lot of gamers want single-player games</a>, that doesn’t mean publishers are going to stop making live-service titles. The reality is that publishers want to nickel and dime people with one game rather than make a few very expensive single-player adventures that could flop and can’t support years of seasonal updates and battle passes.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Valley of Memory DLC update is going live on November 18 at &nbsp;14:00 UTC / 10:00 AM EDT / 7:00 AM PT, introducing 6 hours of new content, many significant gameplay improvements, and some fixes.</p>



<p>The Valley of Memory’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-mirage-valley-of-memory-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy List</a> was revealed a few days ago, providing a complete list of trophies and achievements players can target. Now, Title Update 1.1.0 is going live for AC Mirage, introducing the new free DLC and a substantial update. The update’s size according to platforms is as follows: PlayStation 5 – 22.6GB, PlayStation 4 – 16.6GB, Xbox Series X/S – 32.39GB, Xbox One – 10.11GB, PC – 28.15GB. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-assassin-s-creed-mirage-title-update-1-1-0-valley-of-mirage-dlc">What’s New in Assassin’s Creed Mirage Title Update 1.1.0 Valley of Mirage DLC</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-free-content">New Free Content</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC comes as a free update for all players, taking them on a new adventure with Basim. Basim has heard something about his long-lost father still being alive, and chasing these rumours, he has reached the new region, AlUla, “a land of secrets, ancient ruins, and vibrant oases. Players will have to complete the “Head of the Snake” mission to access this content. New game players have the option to skip ahead in the story directly through the main menu. </p>



<p>The region of AlUla will feature hours of content that players can explore, including new and returning world activities, family-friendly side activities, world events, work contracts, and brand-new additions. Some of these additions have been named, including Stolen Goods and Oud Melodies, the first mission asks you to stal maps from robbers and the second has players collect musical scenes through parkour sequences. </p>



<h3 id="h-gameplay-improvements">Gameplay Improvements</h3>



<p>As mentioned above, players will observe some significant gameplay improvements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage after title update 1.1.0. Firstly, the free jump option has been included, allowing players to jump manually by pressing a button. Side and back ejects can now be performed even when Basim has no clear area to land on or has a handhold. The “Free” mode can be toggled on/off, and “Safe” mode can be used if you prefer safe and sound landings for Basim. </p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC update will also introduce replayable missions, known as Animus Sequences. These missions will present new challenges that can be completed for rewards, including Animus Mods. These mods are essential auto-refills for your tools and resources, which can only be used in this mode or New Game+. </p>



<p>Two new difficulties have also been added: Hardened Assassin, which comes between Assassin (Normal) and Master Assassin (Hard). Ultra Hardened is the new hardest difficulty, and there is also a new Custom Difficulty preset for a more tailored experience. The DLC also adds a tier 3 tool upgrade, with Throwing Knives becoming explosive, Smoke Bomb becoming corrosive and disolving dead enemies, Blow Darts piercing through heavily armored enemies, Noiskmakes putting enemies to sleep in the impact zone, and Traps can make enemies attack their fellow guards. </p>



<p>There are additional improvements, additions, which you can check out in the full patch notes below: </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 10 Minutes Of Battlefield 6 Season 1 New Maps Gameplay (Blackwell Fields and Eastwood)</p>
      </div>
<p>"As we got closer to launch, we revisited aim-assist tuning based on internal testing and the full range of maps and combat distances coming with release. Our goal was to make aim-assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and open beta," the developer said. "At launch, we increased slowdown at longer ranges, but once the game went live, we saw that this made high-zoom aiming feel less smooth and harder to control.</p><p>"After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim-assist back to the values some of you experienced during open beta and Battlefield Labs. This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings," Battlefield Studios added. "This change keeps aim slowdown consistent across all ranges, helping with muscle memory and providing a steadier, more reliable feel as we move into future seasons."</p><p>The November 18 update is called California Resistance, and in addition to the aim-assist and other gameplay tuning changes, it adds new content, including the California-set map Eastwood. Variations of the map will be available for all modes, and for Conquest, it'll support tanks, helicopters, and the golf cart. There is also a new mode called Sabotage, which is a limited-time mode focused on "demolition and counterplay." New weapons are coming, too, including the DB-12 shotgun and the M357 Trait sidearm.</p><p>The Gauntlet mode, meanwhile, gets a new mission type in the form of Rodeo. "This mission provides multiple vehicles for players to fight over and battle with each other with. Players earn bonus points for defeating enemies while in a vehicle," Battlefield Studios said.</p><p>There are also updates for the Portal mode, including the introduction of a sandbox mode that allows Portal users to "start with a more level playing field to bring their imagination to life." Additionally, the golf cart vehicle will be supported in Portal mode, while a "bonus path" part of the Season 1 battle pass called The California Resistance will be unlocked with the new update.</p><p>Beyond the new content, the 1.1.2.0 update adds further weapon accuracy and dispersion tuning and provides a "major polish pass" to deployable objects such as the LWCMS Portable Mortar, LTLM II Portable Laser Designator, and Supply Crate systems.</p><p>Another change is the introduction of a new keybinding on PC that allows players to swap to the knife instantly instead of needing to hold the button. "This keybinding will not allow to perform takedowns contextually but will still allow takedowns to be performed once the melee weapon is equipped," the developer said.</p><p>There are a few changes for Battlefield Redsec as well, including a fix for a bug that caused the golf cart to set off the PTKM-1R gadget in the Gauntlet mode. The update also fixes a bug that made the squadmate death sound effect trigger for people outside of their squad.</p><h2>Patch notes for 1.1.2.0</h2><p><strong>PLAYER:</strong></p><ul><li>Aim Assist: fully reset to Open Beta tuning, with related options reset to default to ensure consistency.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Vehicle Stick Acceleration Presets would affect Infantry Aiming Left/Right Acceleration option availability.</li><li>Fixed an issue where setting Stick Acceleration Presets to “Standard” would set the Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options incorrectly to 50% instead of 70%.</li><li>Fixed missing Infantry and Vehicle prefixes in captions for Stick Acceleration Presets and Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options.</li><li>Fixed an issue where stick deadzones would ignore the first 10% of movement if using a PS5 Controller on PC.</li><li>Fixed an issue where player movement (Left Stick) would not register until beyond 30% of travel past the deadzone.</li><li>Fixed joystick aiming input behaviour.</li><li>Added a short sprint “restart” animation when landing from small heights.</li><li>Added new death animations for sliding and combat-dive states.</li><li>Fixed a diving loop when entering shallow water.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing players from vaulting out of water in certain areas.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing takedown initiation against an enemy soldier if the enemy soldier already initiated a takedown against a friendly player.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a dragged player could face the wrong direction if turning quickly.</li><li>Fixed an issue where holding a grenade while jumping, sliding, or diving froze the first-person pose.</li><li>Fixed an issue where switching weapons while drag-reviving would break the reviver’s first-person view.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Assault Class extra grenade ability would not grant two grenades on spawn.</li><li>Fixed an issue where weapons could become invisible when crouching before vaulting.</li><li>Fixed bouncing behaviour when landing on object edges.</li><li>Fixed broken ragdolls when killed on ladders, while jumping, near ledges, or in vehicle seats.</li><li>Fixed camera clipping when dropping from height while prone.</li><li>Fixed clipping when initiating a drag &amp;

But, despite the changes, some things remain; namely, your party in Reimagined. When all is said and done, it will still consist of Hero, Maribel, Prince Kiefer (who are front and center on our latest magazine cover), Ruff, Aishe, and Sir Mervyn.&nbsp;</p><p>To get you primed for Reimagined, we spoke to the game's lead scenario writer, Sayaka Takagi, and producer Takeshi Ichikawa about each of these party members, and below, we'll list out everything she told us about them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like every Dragon Quest, Reimagined’s protagonist is named Hero, and in this quest, he’s the son of a fisherman in Pilchard Bay on the island of Estard. The majority of his personality will be shaped by how you respond in dialogue. He wants to be the fisherman his father and mother want him to be, but he’s not quite ready to do so…almost as if a different adventure is calling after him.</p><p>"So one thing I had in mind, and perhaps this might not be the nicest thing to say about the character, is that we wanted to make him as normal as possible, the average Joe, like the blank slate that you described," Ichikawa tells me. "We just wanted [Hero] to be more normal – average – than any of the other heroes in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined."&nbsp;</p><h3>Prince Kiefer</h3>

<p>Kiefer is the Prince of the Kingdom of Estard and Hero’s childhood best friend. Despite his royal background, Kiefer is desperate to find a purpose in life (ideally away from a throne). He often lures Hero into questionable situations, but his heart is in the right place. He makes a great Warrior in combat.</p><p>"So Kiefer is actually a pretty naïve boy," Ichikawa says. "People might think otherwise, but he's actually someone who's always envious of others, and the reason why is because he's also someone who yearns to become someone – he wants purpose in his life. But despite that, he's promised a lot of power because of his upbringing as a prince, and he's from royalty. But even with that, he doesn't feel like he's serving his purpose; he doesn't feel like he's anyone special, so he's always thinking about other people that he wants to become.&nbsp;</p><p>"That kind of personality is reflected in his dialogue. Considering he's a prince from a royal family, you would think he might speak in a well-mannered fashion, but he doesn't actually speak that way. He speaks a lot more casually."&nbsp;</p><h3>Maribel Mayde</h3>

<p>The daughter of Pilchard Bay’s mayor, Maribel Mayde is cute and adorable, with a bit of edge reflected in the jokes and hard times she lobs at Hero. Still, she’s a reliable partner on your journey and grows to become someone who cares for the world around her (including the rest of the party). She’s also an excellent Priestess and Mage, though she, like the rest of the party, can slot into any vocation the player wishes.</p><p>"Maribel is a very cute girl, just such an adorable character," Takagi tells me while reflecting on what she's learned about this character upon reflection during the development of Reimagined. "I was pretty young when I played the original version, in elementary school, and back then, I just always felt like she's a mean girl, and loud. She gets angry at the protagonist all the time, so I didn't really have a good impression of her back then. But revisiting the game as an adult and actually getting to understand her as a person, as a character, she's actually very supportive of the protagonist. She encourages you, she uplifts you, and she's a reliable partner who is essential to the journey of the party.</p><p>"I have found a new appreciation for her character. [...] One thing I can speak to about writing her dialogue is that Maribel tends to say a lot of things most people wouldn't. This applies to other staff members who contributed to the scenario writing, but a lot of them share this same sentiment: writing her dialogue actually feels nice, because you get to say things you would want to say but can't really say."&nbsp;</p><h3>Ruff</h3>

<p>Ruff is a cheerful, pure-hearted boy, and he is always accompanied by a wolf that also helps in combat. Though sometimes naïve, he possesses animal-like instincts, not unlike Akira Toriyama’s Goku. He cruises around the oceans surrounding Estard with Hero and the rest of the party with an eye toward the horizon, and he’s a great Martial Artist fighter, too.</p><p>"There's a certain wild element with that character," Ichikawa says. "In the Japanese version, it leans [into] his pure side and personality. And he's someone that you want to protect because of his pureness. So we really leaned [into] that element and his dialogue; he's really cute and adorable, too."&nbsp;</p><h3>Aishe</h3>

<p>Aside from Sir Mervyn, Aishe is the eldest member of Hero’s party. As such, she’s reliable and adept at combat. She’s a high-ranking Roamer in the world of Reimagined, which explains both the apparent sexiness Toriyama instilled in her design and the class with which she carries herself. She hits hard in combat, but works well as the playful Dancer, Troubadour, or Jester, too.</p><p>"One of the main components of Aishe is that she is supposed to be this reliable person, but also an attractive woman too," Takagi tells me. "Aside from Sir Mervyn, she's the eldest member of the party, and she's a reliable member of the group for the younger party members. There's definitely a sexiness as well – she is supposed to have a high rank among the Roamers, so she has an element of class, too."&nbsp;</p><h3>Sir Mervyn</h3>

<p>Without spoiling much of what you’ll learn about Sir Mervyn in Reimagined, he’s a paladin from the past, sealed within a special stone awaiting the next fight he’s needed in. Fortunately, it’s Hero who releases him and enlists him to help on their present-day adventure. He’s a mighty Paladin, but any mix of melee and magic will be successful for him.</p><p>Ichikawa and Takagi wouldn't share too much about Sir Mervyn, and if you are familiar with Dragon Quest VII, you can probably imagine why, but I recommend you check out this feature on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/05/how-the-new-voice-over-affected-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">colloquialism in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> for more insight into how the team developed this version of the character.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll learn more about this party in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined when it launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Serendipitously, a day before Shigeru Miyamoto via Nintendo’s official Twitter account released the first three still images of director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1226871/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Wes Ball</u></a>‘s upcoming live-action <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda</em></u></a> movie, I experienced my first ever piece of <em>Zelda </em>media: <a href="https://kotaku.com/remembering-possibly-the-worst-thing-zelda-ever-did-5766645?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> 1989 cartoon</u></a>. It's kinda astonishing how bad a first impression it was as my first-ever introduction to a beloved Nintendo series.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link (1/2). <a href="https://t.co/fbadNgaDqY?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/fbadNgaDqY</a></p>— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>To set the scene: Yes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fart-that-one-dude-when-your-homies-brag-about-how-long-v0-m7gaels0i4m81.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D6d396c382aee10504280fd6898f29415170b3027&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>I’ve never played a single <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> video game</u></a>. That being said, the past three decades of cultural osmosis on Earth have given me the tools to get the bare essentials of what Nintendo’s blonde twink is all about. He wears green, swings a sword, is mild-mannered, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/if-link-talks-i-walk/"><strong><u>should never talk</u></strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how’d I get here? A patron at my friend’s art gallery, where we meet every Sunday evening for a community drawing night, came through with some VHS tapes after hearing we sometimes play old movies and shows on a CRT we roll out, substitute-teacher style, while drawing. Their humble offerings for us this week were VHS tapes of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, <em>Captain Planet</em>, and, of course, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. After hearing my diatribe about what I do for work, everyone was shocked to see my off-guard smile, which turned into a frown as I turned back to them, minutes into the VHS tape, saying, “I don’t like this.”</p><p>For starters, the cartoon wasted no time committing the cardinal sin of character assassination of my vague image of Link by having him talk… a lot. While I’m <a href="https://kotaku.com/remembering-possibly-the-worst-thing-zelda-ever-did-5766645?ref=aftermath.site"><u>not the first</u></a>, nor even <a href="https://aftermath.site/if-link-talks-i-walk/" rel="noreferrer">t<u>he second Aftermather</u></a> to wax poetic about the phenomenon of Link talking being all of the red flags, my main gripe with the show is less about him not grunting “hyat!” or “hyup” or saying “<a href="https://youtu.be/iZUuW3YgDeY?ref=aftermath.site"><u>come on</u></a>.” It’s that he’s an annoying little shit.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t believe me, see for yourself.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ec6YrD4myII?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Legend of Zelda 101 - The Ringer"></iframe></figure><p>They didn’t just create one of these; they made <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLySo2SlSHPSNYc2kkPjAJHVK1ThT1Lb_P&amp;si=U1B19pgKa0z1LciO&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>13 episodes</u></a> of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> cartoon. As Luke wrote for the other site, this cartoon emerged as Nintendo’s first effort to turn its properties into a cross-media phenomenon, jumping from games to TV. While still reeling from the shock of having my first full experience with <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and surprised that it might also be others’ first introduction, the wonderfully animated series isn’t bratty little brother energy I can laugh with, but rather an annoying rugrat I can’t wait to be rid of.</p><p>Chief among the things that gave me the ick about this Link were:</p><ul><li>Him cat calling Zelda</li><li>His whiny frat boy voice&nbsp;</li><li>His Marvel movie headass quips</li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/qzfXxkHrIBM?ref=aftermath.site"><u>His shitty catchphrase</u></a></li><li>His “where my hug” energy</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=437490007147524"><u>I can't stress enough how wack this Link is</u></a>. I genuinely felt like he gave me COVID through the buzzing CRT television screen while I watched him wander around for 15 minutes. To my absolute horror, when I looked up the series to wonder why in the hell Nintendo, with their famous reckless wisdom from back in the day, would approve of this, I found out that one of the running jokes for the Viacom cartoon was Link pestering Zelda for a kiss. I'll just go ahead and rip off the band-aid by telling you all that in the show’s last episode, an act of God causes the earth to literally crumble under his feet as Link tries to finally kiss Zelda. After what I can only imagine was months of coercing, Zelda finally stumbles into admitting that she, despite how irritating he is, loves him, and that he’s at least earned a little kiss, which she stresses, “means nothing.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>A lion does not concern itself with being a whiny simp.

One of these was called </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-pve-event-is-its-best-yet-1825183663">Retribution</a>,</span></i><span> and it starred Reaper, Cassidy, Genji, and Moira as members of Blackwatch, Overwatch’s covert operatives arm. At the beginning of the mission, Reaper kills a man named Antonio Bartalotti, a criminal and member of the chaos-seeding Talon organization. This assassination sets up the mission players fight through, as well as the eventual downfall of the Overwatch organization, but as we learned today, over seven years later, it was also a canon event for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next hero, Vendetta.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard has released a new animated trailer titled La Lupa which shows Vendetta, a new, sword-wielding hero, fighting a massive Omnic in Colosseo to the tune of hundreds of less-than-adoring fans. In her voiceover, she’s talking to her Papa who taught her how to outsmart her opponents, whether that be in Chess or in a coliseum. Then the trailer reveals that her father was none other than Antonio. So now, after all those years, Vendetta has…a vendetta against the members of Blackwatch. That organization is defunct, though, so I guess she’s taking out all her frustrations on robots in the coliseum.</span></p> <p><span>We don’t see any gameplay of Vendetta in action, but she does seem to be one of the rare melee heroes in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s roster. She’s built like a tank, so she might fall into that role, but we’ll know for sure soon since Blizzard is holding a trial run for the character from November 6 to December 1.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>



<p>The news comes roughly five months since it was announced that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being shut down</a>.</p>







<p><strong>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games,”</strong> <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Collins-Laflamme said</a>. <strong>“While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme said that the studio has hired <strong>“more than 30 developers who know this game inside and out, with additional returns in the coming days.”</strong></p>



<p>He says that the team is going to go back to the original version of what Hytale was supposed to be. It was added that the studio is fully independent and committed to funding Hytale <strong>“for the next 10 years”.</strong></p>







<p>As far as what’s next, an Early Access release and pricing will be announced <strong>“in the coming days”.</strong> It’ll be available first on Windows with a Mac and Linux release possible and other platforms later on. Regarding content, the Early Access version of Hytale will include a Creative Mode, Exploration Mode, and Modding capabilities. What won’t be available are minigames and an Adventure Mode. Both of those will come later on.</p>

But now, in an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevivor</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa has at least acknowleged the ongoing speculation — and confirmed one particular image is a fan creation. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil fans have recently been debating the veracity of an image shared widely on social media that features an older Leon with an eyepatch. Many had suggested the picture was likely AI-generated, and now, addressing this image specifically, Kumazawa has described it as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more [fan] detective work," Kumazawa said. "So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don't know what's right or what's wrong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players are free to believe what they would like to believe," he continued, "what I'd like to tell is that, please, unless it's officially released from Capcom, we can't give you any confirmation."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking at this again, I think this leaked image of RE9 Leon is fake.

This pricier package advertises the fact it contains five additional costumes total, though only a couple for Grace have so far been showcased. As well as that, each in-game item is labelled with the "Grace's Costume:" prefix, something fans have excitedly suggested means that more costumes for other characters (Leon) are being held back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon," Kumazawa stated, "but just to make sure, these are all fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, however, Capcom appears to have stopped short of saying Leon isn't in the game — and at this point, if he wasn't, you'd think its developers would want to set the record straight in order to start managing expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S — whether it includes Leon or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<p dir="ltr">They also feature persistent lobbies from match to match that, when combined with Quick Play, results in what Treyarch states are "unique interactions that we are monitoring to improve over time."</p><p dir="ltr">The decision to not include SBMM has been a major discussion point for Black Ops 7, after years of calls for it to be removed by some vocal players, not only in Call of Duty but in other shooters as well. Ubisoft's short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">XDefiant looked to capitalize on its lack of SBMM</a>. Call of Duty's main rival this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-matchmaking-does-not-prioritize-skill/1100-6533896/" data-ref-id="1100-6533896">Battlefield 6, does use SBMM to some extent</a>, but also factors in a player's location, ping, and server availability when putting together a match.</p><p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-black-ops-7-multiplayer-playlists-will-have-sbmm-but-most-wont/1100-6536138/" data-ref-id="1100-6536138">most modes and playlists in Black Ops 7 multiplayer don't use SBMM</a>, there are a few that do. Those include a rotating Moshpit playlist and the game's ranked mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 received its latest patch on November 16, which fixed exploits in the Ashes of the Damned Zombies map, issues related to custom loadouts when using Spanish as the in-game language, and a bug that saw selected game modes in the Quick Play filter sometimes become inverted.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Black Ops 7 news, Activision confirmed in a statement that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">developers do use AI tools</a>, but that "our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios" amidst players accusing Black Ops 7 of using AI to generate artwork for Calling Cards. The game's Steam page also discloses that AI was used to develop some in-game assets.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 review</a>, reviewer S.E. Doster called the game's multiplayer package "a fresh experience that avoids any dreaded fatigue," while its co-op campaign "is not one of Treyarch's strongest campaigns" despite some strong emotional character moments that tie back to Black Ops 2.</p>

                <p>Last month Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">Microsoft is developing a next-gen Xbox console</a>. Bond has reiterated that statement several times as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">Microsoft faces rumors</a> that it's getting out of the hardware business. Now, Bond is once again hyping up the next incarnation of Xbox by calling it "a powerful experience."</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune</a>, Bond said, "Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, love the hardware experience. That's why we’re working on our next-generation hardware. It's going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3P0bOAWNVR4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bond shared her belief that players want the freedom to choose to play their games on Xbox, PC, or the cloud, and that the next Xbox will give them the option to do so. She <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/" data-ref-id="1100-6535604">made similar comments</a> while promoting the ROG Xbox Ally in October.</p><p>Although it's been expected that PlayStation 6 and the next Xbox will debut in 2027, a video game analyst has suggested that the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> delay <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-and-next-xbox-may-not-release-until-2028-due-to-gta-6-delay-expert-says/1100-6536134/" data-ref-id="1100-6536134">could push both consoles to a 2028 debut</a>.

There has also been a strong response to the ROG Xbox Ally, which has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-to-ramp-up-rog-xbox-ally-production-after-initial-sales-exceed-expectations/1100-6536270/" data-ref-id="1100-6536270">led Asus to increase production</a> for the handheld system.</p><p>Microsoft will host a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-showcase-coming-up-this-week/1100-6536277/" data-ref-id="1100-6536277">Xbox Partner Preview</a> on November 20, but it's not expected to have any news related to the next-gen Xbox console.</p>

<figure data-uuid="cb5b5a86655b2"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb5b5a86655b2/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has officially lifted the lid on the live-action looks for Zelda and Link in the upcoming Zelda movie with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/official-zelda-movie-photos-give-us-our-best-look-yet-at-link-and-zelda">trio of official photos</a> (compared to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/rumour-zelda-movie-production-set-footage-has-supposedly-leaked-online">leaked 'on-set' footage</a> that appeared online days before).</p>
<p>We've got our first look at Benjamin Evan Ainsworth's Link and Bo Bragason's Princess Zelda in their full Hylian garb, and while it's far from a detailed look at either, there's no denying that some video game inspo has gone into the design choices — who would have thought it!</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the Hero of Hyrule himself, and we're not the only ones getting some serious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess">Twilight Princess</a> vibes from his look, are we? The dark green tunic is a series staple — with some exceptions, obvs — but that cream undershirt paired with the leather fingerless gloves and cross-body strap has a strong whiff of the shape-shifting grittiness we first saw back in 2006.</p>
<p>We can't make out any chainmail from this first look, mind you, <em>and</em> the signature hat is missing, so we'll throw in a <em>little</em> mention for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> Champion's Tunic while we're here. Sure, it's green instead of blue, but the detailing around the collar gives a certain Switch-y flare to the whole thing.</p>

<p>Zelda's live-action reimagining isn't quite as clean-cut in its game inspirations as Link's, but the blue dress is straight out of the BOTW/<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a> lookbook. It's missing some of the elements that really made those designs <em>pop</em> — the white and gold detailing, the chunkiness of the belt, <em>the cape</em> (in TOTK's case) — but the colour palette certainly presents a more modern look for the princess than the classic pink ballgowns of old.</p>

<p>Of course, a feature-length runtime means that there will likely be plenty of room for different looks besides those we've seen in today's snaps, but we're pretty impressed with this initial glance — even if we do wish that Zelda's get-up was a <em>little</em> more detailed.</p>
<p>The big question is, what do you make of these live-action looks? You can let us know in the following polls, but then take to the comments to share what you like, and what you'd change.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a> is due out in early access later this week, and ahead of that developer PlayerUnknown Productions laid out a little roadmap of updates you can expect in the coming… months? They didn't specify, which isn't necessarily a bad thing - I think setting expectations of when certain features may arrive encourages a more demanding audience - but they did give a good overview of what's to come.
</p>
<p>
Starting things off is a list of plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's world and environment, which primarily focus on adding "realism, scale, and cohesion to the world." Namely, that includes things like paths and trails that are clearer in how you're meant to navigate them, alongside river systems with "source, tributaries, rapids, and deltas, bringing new movement and life to the world." Eat your heart out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS1HIci4hQ">Any Austin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And there's also plans for more varied settlements, alongside water that freezes and thaws depending on the weather and season. That one sounds quite neat! I feel like the effects of weather is a thing that many games still don't get quite right yet, hopefully something systems driven like this can have a good crack at it.
</p>
<p>
On the gameplay side of things, there's plans to expand on the game's building system, to add in new ingredients and recipes, make it so that you might need batteries or to repair a power system, and to make it so that clothing can degrade over time, but be fixed too.
</p><p>
More miscellaneously, the <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/news/prologue-go-wayback-early-access-roadmap">roadmap</a> also outlines its intention to add in full controller support, Steam Deck support, an in-game camera mode, and for the streamer out there, Twitch integration that allows viewers to mess with spawns and other bits. More ambitiously (and I question whether this will be the game's downfall), the game will also let you build your own worlds, rules, maps, and experiences to share with others. Not everything needs to have user-generated bits, but Prologue: Go Wayback will have them whether it needs them or not.
</p>
<p>

              <p><span>The CEO of the studio behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i></a><span>, the wildly successful third-person shooter that recently came to Xbox, weighed in on the video game industry’s increasing use of AI and how he believes it “actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <p><span>As reported by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani was on an episode of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=JJHjmoQPGIj-Fb5v&amp;t=1561"><span>The Game Business Show</span></a><span> when the conversation shifted to the use of AI in game development. The host, Christopher Dring, brought up the “industry moment” around </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, the recently released extraction shooter that’s been a breakout hit for developer Embark Studios, and the center of a conversation around using AI in game development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For Jorjani, opinions on the controversial topic are too black and white. “Maybe, could it be, that reality is somewhere in the middle? Could it be?” he asked. He believes that, rather than developers using AI to “remove the stuff we don’t want to do,” people jump to “let’s never actually use AI, all AI is bad AI.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We don’t put any AI in the games,” Jorjani says. “But if it can allow me to do my receipts faster, that’s more </span><i><span>Helldivers</span></i><span> for everyone.”</span></p> <p><span>It was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><span>recently revealed that Embark hired voice actors for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, then used AI to flesh out in-game voice lines rather than having “someone come in every time we create a new line for the game,” according to an </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"><span>interview with </span><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>. This sparked a heated debate about the use of AI in game development and even negatively </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><span>affected </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>’s review of the game</span></a><span> (which awarded it two out of five stars).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“I find that people jump to extreme takes,” Jorjani says of the response to </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>’ AI use. “I think it’s a very interesting use case that actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <h2><b>The AI game development controversy continues</b></h2> <p><span>But as Dring brings up during the interview, Square Enix recently revealed it wants to eventually have 70 percent of its quality assurance work done by AI. QA work often serves as an entry-level role in game development, and this could be a huge hit to the industry’s workforce, which is one of the main points of contention people have with implementing AI.</span></p>

 <p><span>Junghun Lee, the CEO of Nexton Co. Ltd (which published </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>), said in a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/"><span>November 12 interview</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><span>Japanese gaming site </span><i><span>Gamespark</span></i></a> <span>that “</span><span>it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” But with the video game industry plagued with layoffs and studio closures, what does that mean for the future of its workforce?</span></p>

 <p><span>The ideological split is only widening. Brendan Green, the creator of the wildly successful battle royale </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span>, told </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span> he was “really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff.” </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span> is published by South Korean company Krafton, which </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation"><span>recently announced a massive “AI-first” mandate</span></a><span> for the entire company while also announcing the option for employees to voluntarily resign if they felt they were not in line with its “direction of change.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Elsewhere, </span><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>publisher Activision </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>recently came under fire for using AI-generated content</span></a><span> for some of its artwork. “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios,” Activision told</span><i><span> Kotaku</span></i><span> on November 14.</span></p> <p><span>AI in game development seems to be here to stay, but just how it will be utilized going forward, and how developers, voice actors, and players will feel about it, remains to be seen.</span></p>
