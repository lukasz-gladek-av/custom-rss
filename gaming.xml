            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/crush-house-impressions-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a huge fan of reality TV (with the exception of <a href="https://go.tlc.com/show/sister-wives-tlc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sister Wives</em></a> because it’s about religion), so I wasn’t sure recent game <a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/the-crush-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Crush House</em></a> would be my thing. But the game is less about cringing at other people’s drama and more about what it’s like to use the core mechanic of filming that drama to explore what stands between a reality show's subjects and their audience.</p><p><em>The Crush House</em>, which came out last week, casts you as Jae, a producer on a reality show. You select a cast of four characters and then film them living in a glitzy mansion together, keeping different audiences satisfied enough to keep the show from getting cancelled. If you make it through a week-long season, the cast goes home, and then you start over with a new cast of your choosing.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Crush House | Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHdOX9XpWJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s an underlying plot about things not being quite what they seem in the titular Crush House. To move that story forward, you need to do on-the-side tasks for cast members, which can’t necessarily be completed in one season of the show. This adds some structure to your repeated runs, but I could also find it a little annoying when I had to bring back cast members across seasons just to knock out their goals. But this also brings in <em>The Crush House</em>’s first layer of strategy: if I need to film softboi Milo making friends and enemies, I have to pick other cast members likely to form those relationships with him, like the sunny Charlie or the pretentious Gunther.&nbsp;</p><p>This cast makeup also matters for the audiences you have to satisfy to keep the show from getting cancelled. Every morning, you get a growing list of viewers with particular desires. Some are straightforward: Butt Guys want to see butts, and Plumbers want to see the house’s water fixtures. Voyeurs want to see the cast filmed from faraway, creepy angles, and Film Students want to see fancy shots. But other audiences can be harder to please, with unclear desires–what the hell do The Glitched or Nursing Home residents like?--or reliant on the cast doing things you may or may not be able to engineer. Divorced Dads want to see men bonding, so you’ll need male cast members likely to bond; Drama Queens want to see people fighting, so you’ll need cast members likely to clash.</p><p>Since you don’t know what audiences you’ll get when you’re picking a cast at the start of the season, this can be tough– once, I found myself needing to satisfy Girls for Girls fans when I had a cast full of boys. Luckily, fully satisfied audiences’ enthusiasm will leak over to other audiences, helping you make up the gaps. And you can also buy props, using money you get from ads Jae runs when she’s not filming, to make cast members more likely to engage in certain behaviors or to help satisfy audiences–Divorced Dads will be happy to look at the grill if you don’t have male cast members who are friends. But props can be expensive, and time spent running ads means time not filming, making each day a hectic balancing act.</p><p>Eventually, you’ll see all the audiences and know what they want, but the game felt the most fun to me when I’d get a brand-new audience and rush frantically around the house aiming my camera at everything to try to figure out what they wanted to see. There’s a thrill to staring down five audiences late into a season, with some wanting to see the garden, others wanting to see two characters fighting by the pool, and <em>others</em> wanting to see my cast full of enemies impossibly be friends. All this leaves me running back and forth, squeezing ads into the transition, hoping I make it to the end of the day.</p><p>At the same time, all this really boils down to just swinging your camera around until various icons appear on the screen, with the actual cast and their lives becoming secondary. I’m not sure if <em>The Crush House</em> wants you to be engaged in casts’ lives and desires, the way an actual reality TV audience is meant to, or if the game’s mechanics are meant to make you see them as just means to an end, number-go-up generators that keep the show going, the way the game’s deeper plot suggests. Most likely, it’s meant to be both–not so much to make a statement about reality TV as to situate you in that tension at its heart. I often felt like I had largely missed the actual relationships between people in a season, engaged in swinging between shots of the offshore lighthouse and a branded juice machine to give my audiences what they wanted while actual human drama went on out of frame.</p><p>I found the game more mechanically fun than I found it narratively engaging, but that’s not a bad thing. Each day felt stressful and exciting as I grew familiar with the best vantage points in the house or the perfect camera angle, squeezing in an ad or two to work toward a prop as I noticed drama stewing or romance about to ensue. Failure means starting a day over, and you can also set the difficulty so that the show is never cancelled, meaning the stakes are never high enough to make the game too frustrating if you’re unlucky with your audiences or cast. The core thing you do in the game is enjoyable, even if it’s not all that deep.</p><p>I’m enjoying the way <em>The Crush House</em> scratches a certain roguelike itch I have; I've seen other reviews liken it to a twist on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/09/the-crush-house-review-love-island-with-a-dark-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-person shooter</a>, which is another fun way to look at it. Each day is a jumble of conflicting demands, a combination of repetition and randomness that I steadily master, selectively choosing from realities on offer while filming a lot of faucets and video game character butts along the way. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warzone-being-separated-from-premium-call-of-duty-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an attempt to reduce the download size of Call of Duty games, Warzone is being officially separated from premium <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-recieves-h2m-mod/">Call of Duty</a> games. The Activision developers are gearing up to make significant changes to the Call of Duty HQ launcher on PC so that those specifically interested in Warzone can only download files specifically for Warzone.</p>
<p>To allow this huge event to happen, they are slowly and carefully rolling out the new updates to the launcher. This is not only to ensure that things don't break along the way but also to reduce the install size of the other Call of Duty games by any amount. To ensure that the games are reduced in size, Activision will expand its stream tech and add more content to the streaming pool instead.</p>
<p>Doing this means that they will cycle the less frequently used content in the streaming cache and continue to expand what content can be streamed in general to lessen the load on the players. One part of this is the "On-Demand Texture Streaming" option, which will be changed to "On-Demand High Quality Streaming." While that may not sound too different from what it is now, there will be two options for players to utilize. One of the options will prioritize higher fidelity graphics that require more bandwidth, while the other forgoes graphical quality and uses less bandwidth.</p>
<p>By doing this mass revamp, they hope it will make other games on the launcher easier to access, with players only having to download specifically what they want to play. Unfortunately for some, players must download bigger files to pave the way for smaller download sizes. This is a lengthy process that Activision will be sinking a lot of time into.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 users are most likely going to be the unhappiest of them all, as they will have to download four separate chunks in Season 5 Reloaded. This includes the initial system-level update and three more that are triggered by opening Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. However, this is currently only necessary for current players who are playing now and continuing to keep up with the latest iterations of the franchise. Those completely new to the franchise won't have to deal with this.</p>
<p>Activision has<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap#:~:text=texture%20streaming%20tech-,Separating%20Call%20of%20Duty%3A%20Warzone%20from%20the%20default%20download%20for,for%20that%20game%20by%20default." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted its schedule for the big revamp</a> and is making way for Black Ops 6. Below is the schedule people can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reorganizing game content, part of the Season 5 Reloaded update (August 21)</li>
<li>Black Ops 6 Open Beta (August 30)</li>
<li>New User Interface (Mid-October)</li>
<li>Black Ops 6 Launch (October 25)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, anyone who logs in after the Season 5 Reloaded update will get a package of Battle Pass Tier Skips and Double XP Tokens.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sims-like-inzoi-lets-you-try-out-its-character-creator-next-week.954996/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that it's releasing a free&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>character creator tool on Steam next week, allowing you to create your very own Zoi for the Early Access release (whenever that happens to be).</p>
<p>The tool will be released on Wednesday, August 21st, and will be available until August 26th, so you'll have five days to make your Zoi. Once the character is made, you'll then be able to use them in&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>"post Early Access launch".</p>
<p>This is very much the full&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>character creation tool; it'll come complete with "over 250 customization options", from hair, facial features, and complexion all the way to fingernails and more. As Krafton says, you're "limited only by [your] imagination".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-character-creator-example.jpg?itok=Ll5FAHTM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-character-creator-example.jpg?itok=wOGYtxc6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>InZoi</em>'s character creator will offer a very in-depth facility for making your Zoi.</figcaption></figure><p><em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>is also making use of generative AI; according to Krafton, AI will allow you to "create unlimited possibilities for patterns" for your Zoi's clothing. Weirdly,&nbsp;<em>InZoi</em>'s Steam page doesn't disclose its use of generative AI, which would, I think, technically be a contravention of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam's AI rules</a>.</p>
<p>Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-changes-rules-on-ai-to-allow-vast-majority-of-games-that-use-it">does allow</a> games listed on its store to use AI, but said games are required to disclose its inclusion, whether the AI content is pre-generated or live-generated. We'll have to wait and see whether the&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>character creator bears such a disclaimer when it arrives.</p>
<p>Once you've created your Zoi, you can then upload them to the built-in user-generated content platform Canvas, where other users can download them and leave a like if they think your Zoi is cool. You'd better make them the best Zoi they can be!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-character-creator-example-2.jpg?itok=Pk15imTa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-character-creator-example-2.jpg?itok=ijTh8YOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can share your&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>character creations via the built-in UGC tool.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what exactly&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life sim currently in development over at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton.</p>
<p>The game revolves around the lives of its characters, known as Zois, as they build relationships, get jobs, and generally live out their lives. Just like in&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, you'll be able to shape their stories, build their homes, and watch as they interact with one another.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">cancellation of Paradox's&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em></a> (and the subsequent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled">blow it dealt to the studio's finances</a>),&nbsp;<em>InZoi&nbsp;</em>is one of the only serious&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitors that remains in active development. We'll have to wait and see whether it manages to challenge EA for the life sim crown, though.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/goat-simulator-3-gets-esrb-rating-for-nintendo-switch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/goat-simulator-3-gets-esrb-rating-for-nintendo-switch.954990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/goat-simulator-3-gets-esrb-rating-for-nintendo-switch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40083/goat-simulator-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB website</a>, Coffee Stain North’s Goat Simulator 3 now has a new rating for the Nintendo Switch platform. As expected, it earned a T rating for crude humor, language, and violence. </p>



<p>The rating confirms recent rumors about a Nintendo Switch version. A listing on Amazon Japan surfaced online for the new Switch version not long ago, though the site promptly took that page down.</p>



<p>Before Amazon Japan removed the listing, fans noticed a potential release date of November 7, 2024. However, neither developer Coffee Stain North nor Nintendo have confirmed a concrete release date. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>An official Nintendo Switch release date announcement should arrive fairly soon now that Goat Simulator 3 has an ESRB rating.</p>



<p>Most recently, Coffee Stain North released Goat Simulator 3 – Multiverse of Nonsense DLC for the base game on June 19, 2024. The DLC earned ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam. It added 8 new playable goats, a brand-new map, over 100 new gears, and more.</p>



<p>In April 2024, Embracer Group announced plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split into three companies</a>, one of which is Coffee Stain &amp; Friends. That company will focus on a range of Premium and Free to Play PC, console, and mobile games.</p>



<p>Goat Simulator 3 first launched in 2022, and is available now on mobile, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

                <p>The Epic Games Store has entered the mobile space. Starting today, Android and iOS users in Europe can download the Epic Games Store for mobile, through which they can access <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, Rocket League Sideswipe, and the brand-new mobile version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fall-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-497671">Fall Guys</a>. This includes the first updated version of Fortnite for iOS in four years, just in time for the Marvel-centric <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-start-date-leaks-and-rumors/2900-5569/" data-ref-id="2900-5569">Absolute Doom</a>--it's poetic, since the last update for Fortnite iOS occurred just before the start of the previous Marvel season during Chapter 2.</p><p>Aside from the free rewards that we'll get to in a moment, the biggest item here is the arrival of the mobile version of Fall Guys--it's the same game, now on your phone. All your cosmetic items carry over, and Fall Guys has full cross-progression and cross-platform play between the mobile and console/PC versions.</p><p>Android users will be moving on from the old Epic Games Launcher, which simply allowed you to install and update Fortnite and Rocket League Sideswipe. The Epic Games Store for mobile is intended as an alternative app store, similar to the well-established Amazon Appstore for Android, so the idea is that it will also offer many games from other developers and publishers.</p><p>Installing the Epic Game Store on mobile will require you to sideload it, which any Android can do. For iOS users, only European phones will allow this for now, as a result of the European Union's Digital Markets Act. In the US, Epic's games, including Fortnite, will remain off of iOS devices for the foreseeable future due to the court battle between Epic and Apple which ruled, among other things, that Apple is free to keep the publisher's games off of its platform.</p><p>In other territories, such as the UK and Japan, rulings have yet to arrive in similar court battles, though speaking with Epic on Wednesday, the publisher told GameSpot it remains hopeful that similar decisions will win out in those places, too. For now though, today's significant changes only affect players in Europe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4350957-epicgamesstoremobilerewards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350957" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4350957-epicgamesstoremobilerewards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350957"></a><figcaption>These are the free rewards available from the games on the mobile Epic Games Store.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4350957-epicgamesstoremobilerewards.jpg"></figure><p>Epic is incentivizing players to try out the new Epic Games Store for mobile by offering free unlocks across Fortnite, Fall Guys and Rocket League Sideswipe--there's even a free Fortnite skin involved.</p><p>You can unlock the Katalina skin and her various accessories--a back bling, a pickaxe, and a wrap--by gaining XP playing Fortnite on mobile. Fall Guys mobile is offering a holographic bean skin for use in Fall Guys, and a Yeetus Hammer pickaxe for Fortnite--just complete five levels, and the gifts are yours. And playing any amount of Rocket League Sideswipe will net you a gold-painted Diestro car for both Fortnite and regular Rocket League. You can earn any of these rewards until November 2.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fortnite's new season is now live.

Newsletters are unequivocally </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>in </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">these days and instead of succumbing to crippling FOMO (that's 'fear of missing out'), we figured we'd join the party.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patch Notes will be a casual hangout for the cool cats. A brooding, low-lit jazz bar filled with people who 'get it.' It's your favorite breakfast served in bed. A hallowed space for deep, pensive contemplation. Your dizziest daydream made corporeal. That one—alright, it's mainly just an excuse for news editor Chris Kerr (hello hello) to cut loose on a Friday and pore over the latest game industry happenings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We'll be publishing a new edition of Patch Notes every two weeks to keep you in the know. Inside, you'll find a round-up of the hottest news and some headlines you might have missed; a fragrant platter of interviews and features that'll tickle your tastebuds; and a lovingly curated selection of blogs showcasing the brilliance of our expert community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We reckon there'll be a little sumthin' sumthin' for everyone, so let's get stuck in.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Travel Man: I went to AMAZE Sheffield and all I got was this newfound sense of belonging">Travel Man: I went to AMAZE Sheffield and all I got was this newfound sense of belonging</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I joined a cult the other week. It all happened so fast. One moment I was wandering through a warehouse filled with bizarre contraptions in the outskirts of Sheffield. Then, I was surrounded by a group of people hellbent on mimicking the chants of a rhapsodic flamingo. The strange chorus of faces only illuminated by the streaks of pink neon that adorned the crumbling brick walls. Later, that same group would harness the power of touch to create a link between the mechanical world and our physical forms. This is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://2024.amaze-berlin.de/">AMAZE Festival</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It is magical.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The self-styled 'International Games and Playful Media Festival' usually takes place in Berlin over four days, but made its way to the UK for a one-day soiree featuring a bunch of experimental game installations, rapid 'Hyper Talks' touching on subjects like approachable design and generative AI (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/keyword/amaze-sheffield">read our coverage here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and a thumping warehouse rave that bled into the early hours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The event is split across a daytime and evening program. The former is more serene, letting attendees browse installations at their leisure, attend workshops, and shoot the breeze with their peers. There was even a barbecue, although we're not quite sure if that's part of the standard offering (it absolutely should be).</span></p><p>Left to right: AMAZE attendees playing Crashboard, Between, and Hyper Wobbler</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The evening slalom is where AMAZE truly comes into its own. After a warm opening keynote from organizer Thorstenn Wiedmann and an icebreaker featuring that singing flamingo we mentioned earlier, we segue into an exhilarating Hyper Talk track that is ludicrous and brilliant in equal measure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speakers are introduced to screams of 'hyper, hyper' from a crowd who've been instructed to recite those hallowed words (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJIEK17b9M">all hail Scooter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) whenever they burst on screen. Talks fluctuate between introspective and absurd. We quickly pivoted from a discussion about human touch as a game mechanic into a talk about iconic board game Dream Phone. There is wisdom in both. Then, the show floor opens up. What was previously a chilled space for chinwags becomes an electric hive of activity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A huge group of attendees quickly breaks off to play a colossal game of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bot Party</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an interactive alt ctrl experience that asks players to help dinky robots communicate by interlocking their own limbs. I watch in quiet astonishment as people (many of whom I presumed were previously strangers) coalesce into a mammoth prayer circle to merge with their mechanical counterparts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wherever you look, you'll find more of the same. Friends and strangers holding hands and laughing as they breeze through experimental puzzler </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Amused onlookers encouraging those who've chosen to (quite literally) surf the world wide web in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crashboard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Laughter erupting from a crowd playing a completely unhinged twenty-player version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gang Beasts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Every experience feels designed to spark chaos and camaraderie.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AMAZE is so wonderfully fresh because it eschews conventional industry networking events, which too often prioritize those with a penchant for bars and alcohol (though, of course, you can grab a pint here if that's your thing). I often find those spaces cliquey and impenetrable. Here, in this warehouse full of tactile, offbeat game experiences, people are encouraged to approach each other and truly engage. Bonding over their shared pursuit of a high score or the fact they were sliding across the floor together, digits interlinked, mere seconds ago.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's something deeply affirming about rocking up to an event where silliness is championed and unconventional ideas are celebrated. The industry could perhaps use a few more events like AMAZE, and after dipping my toes in the water a couple of weeks ago, I highly recommend everyone else do the same.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>P.S. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">AMAZE is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/AMazeFest/status/1821561139685163376">hosting a 'digital playground' event at Gamescom 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so check it out if you're zipping to Cologne next week.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The headlines that matter">Status Report: The headlines that matter</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-franchise-from-microsoft">Krafton acquires Tango Gameworks and Hi-Fi Rush franchise from Microsoft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The industry was ready to pour one out for Japanese studio Tango Gameworks after it was unceremoniously shuttered by Xbox despite being praised by its parent company for shadow-dropped success </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

CEO Michael Kuvshynov confirmed the studio has failed to pay some wages, but suggested he was transparent with employees from the outset. Our sources beg to differ. After our article was published, we pushed Kuvshynov for more information but have been met with radio silence.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-july-are-up-in-europe-despite-no-major-releases/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As the title suggests, video game sales increased in July across Europe, which may seem quite bizarre. This month hasn't seen any major releases across any platform, but 2.4 million video games were sold in July, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/video-game-sales-up-in-europe-during-july-despite-a-lack-of-major-releases-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.4% rise year-on-year</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the huge lack of major releases on any platform this July, it's impressive that video game sales have increased. Looking at the Top Ten for July, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is the only game on the list released this year, with every other game being from last year, including top seller EA Sports FC 24.</p>
<p>While to some, the sudden rise of sales for EA Sports FC 24 may come as a shock, it's no surprise considering the European Championships took place in July. Because of this, EA Sports FC 24 sold 69% more copies this July than FIFA 23 did last year.</p>
<p>Looking further into the facts, July saw many gaming promotions that helped boost the sales of specific games. For example, Hitman Absolution, a game initially released in 2012, had a free game promotion on Amazon Prime, boosting the game significantly. Because of the promotion, Hitman Absolution was number eight on the list.</p>
<p>Games like Grand Theft Auto V remain on top, coming in second on the list, with Elden Ring sliding into third position. In the tenth position, It Takes Two is on the list, which is a surprise considering the game's release was in 2022.</p>
<p>Regarding new releases, EA Sports College Football 25 was highly successful in the UK but made it onto the European charts at number 39.</p>
<p>While game sales were up across Europe in July, the same cannot be said about console sales. 263,000 console units were sold across specific markets, <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/">excluding the UK</a> and Germany. Compared to last year, this is a massive 46% drop. For the month of July, PlayStation 5 took the lead in sales but still proceeded to see a drop of 56% since last year. Nintendo Switch is second on the list, and we also see a drop. However, the drop for Nintendo Switch is significantly smaller and comes in at 29% year-on-year.</p>
<p>In third place, the Xbox Series sold the least consoles this year but continued to experience a rather heavy deficit from the year before. Compared to last July, they had a decrease of 42% in all Xbox Series sales.</p>
<p>This month, there was no major news about new consoles or new major launches. People are still waiting restlessly for the Nintendo Switch 2, but it doesn't seem to be coming for a while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-50-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0 release date, and it's bringing a brand new nation, three new characters, and much more later this month.</p>
<p>Version 5.0, also known as "Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn", launches on August 28th, and its main new addition to the free-to-play gacha RPG is the nation of Natlan, whose warriors will become your allies.</p>
<p>All you need to do in order to visit Natlan is to complete the Prologue of Mondstadt's Archon Quest. Once you've done this, a Teleport Waypoint will become available, even for "beginners and intermediates", per HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.0-release-date-yumkasaurus.jpg?itok=F-5ieSyC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.0-release-date-yumkasaurus.jpg?itok=-oNdn0HY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0 has some adorable little critters for you to meet.</figcaption></figure><p>In the nation of Natlan, you'll encounter six tribes, although only three of them will be available in this first update: the Children of Echoes, the Scions of the Canopy, and the People of the Springs.</p>
<p>Each of them has a beast companion you'll also meet, and you'll be able to transform into said beast companions as well, making traversal across Natlan easier.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also look forward to new fighters for your team in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0. This time around, three new characters are making their debut, two of whom are five-star characters and all of whom reflect the cultures of the tribes from which they hail.</p>
<p>The first five-star character is Kinich, a Dendro claymore user who can use a grappling hook. You'll also be able to recruit Mualani, a catalyst-wielding Hydro character who's got her very own signature surfboard. They're joined by four-star Geo polearm user Kachina.</p>

<p>In the first phase of Version 5.0, Event Wishes for Mualani and Kachina will run, alongside a rerun for Kaedehara Kazuha. The second phase of the update will see Kinich making his debut, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-raiden-shogun-baal-build-guide">Raiden Shogun</a> will get a rerun during this phase as well.</p>
<p>As ever, several codes giving you the chance to nab some free stuff have also arrived alongside this update's reveal, and here they are.</p>
<ul><li>2SMTYV59TLFD - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
<li>7SMTGV59BLXH - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
<li>8T4TGDLRA5E5 - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.0 arrives across all platforms on August 28th. You can <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download and play the game for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.irongalaxystudios.com/blog-posts/my-next-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, Adam Boyes announced that they are stepping down as co-CEO of developer Iron Galaxy, with Chelsea Blasko continuing as the sole CEO.</p>



<p>Boyes thanked Iron Galaxy and its team and explained that they will “remain on as a member of this team until the end of the year.” </p>



<p>They also mentioned their plans moving forward, emphasizing the current state of the gaming industry. Boyes stated that “my new inspirations are to find ways to help people who make games solve their biggest problems.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Iron Galaxy’s co-CEO Boyes closed the new blog by reassuring readers that “you haven’t heard the last from me, and neither has IG.” They did not confirm their exact plans nor when fans should expect another update, but they will “talk about that later.”</p>



<p>Iron Galaxy is a developer that works on both original ideas and collaborative projects, and sometimes provide support as consultants. Some of their original titles include Extinction and the short-lived battle royale brawler Rumbleverse. </p>



<p>Fans may recognize Iron Galaxy for their collaborations on games like Uncharted Legacy of Thieves or Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. The developer worked on bringing those iconic games to PC.</p>



<p>The Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-more-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the Xbox Game Pass</a> this month, and Uncharted continues to thrive, building even more fans with another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-uncharted-movie-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action movie under way</a>. </p>

                <p>For nearly three years, gamers have awaited any word about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-is-coming-to-vr-via-oculus-quest-2/1100-6497503/" data-ref-id="1100-6497503">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas VR</a>. It was originally announced in 2021 as a title for the Meta Quest 2. But as Meta moved on to the Meta Quest 3, further updates about the game were scarce. Now, Meta has said that GTA: San Andreas VR is "indefinitely delayed."</p><p>In response to a comment on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAmNSjF9Big&amp;lc=UgwielXvTo--EHoQY7x4AaABAg.A77ZzS0z8DOA7A-RrmuyA-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its official YouTube channel</a>, a Meta Quest VR representative stated that "GTA: San Andreas is on hold indefinitely while we both focus on other projects. We look forward to working with our friends at Rockstar in the future." Meta confirmed the news to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-san-andreas-vr-delayed-indefinitely-as-meta-focuses-on-other-projects" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> shortly thereafter.</p><p>There are some questions about how far along the project was, since Meta never shared any screenshots or video of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas VR. Rockstar's original version of the game was ambitious even when it was released in 2004. San Andreas had a much larger open world than either Grand Theft Auto III or Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, as well as an enthralling story.</p><p>Thanks to the game's enduring popularity, San Andreas was included alongside GTA III and Vice City on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-review-wasted/1900-6417791/" data-ref-id="1900-6417791">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</a>. That remastered compilation was released in 2021 for all of the modern consoles and PC. If Meta's GTA: San Andreas VR port remains on indefinite hold, then The Definitive Edition may be the only way to revisit the title going forward.</p>

                <p>Between May 2022 and November 2023, WWE wrestler <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-star-randy-orton-auditioned-for-major-deadpool-2-role/1100-6525847/" data-ref-id="1100-6525847">Randy Orton</a> was forced to take a lengthy injury hiatus. And apparently, Orton spent much of that time playing From Software's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> and exploring the Lands Between. Orton may be back in action now, but he's logged 600 hours in Elden Ring since he first started playing.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/wwe-superstar-randy-orton-says-hes-put-600-hours-into-elden-ring/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Orton revealed his devotion to Elden Ring during Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes' What Do You Wanna Talk About video series. Orton recalled teasing Rhodes for being a gamer, but now he's become even more of a gamer than Rhodes.</p><p>"I f***ing love Elden Ring," said Orton. "Let me preface this next statement with saying that I was out with spinal fusion surgery, so I had a lot of time on my hands. I got, like, 600 hours on the game... I love that game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/" data-ref-id="1100-6523901">DLC just came out</a>."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqgcnX9MvNY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VqgcnX9MvNY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since becoming the face of WWE, Rhodes doesn't have the same free time he used to. That's one of the reasons why he hasn't played Elden Ring yet. But Orton would still like to share that experience with his friend.</p><p>"You're killing it and you don't got the time, and I understand why," said Orton. "I would love to chop it up about some Elden Ring with you, trust me. I wish you were a fellow Tarnished, but you're not."</p><p>Orton recently signed a new five-year deal with WWE, which would presumably allow him to buy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-elden-ring-book-is-going-to-cost-you-a-fortune/1100-6524860/" data-ref-id="1100-6524860">this upcoming Elden Ring book</a> that is extremely expensive. Even if he doesn't, it sounds like he intends to keep playing the game for a long time to come.</p>

<p>From the same "award-winning team" behind Fallout Shelter, The Elder Scrolls: Castles lets you reign supreme over your very own castle and dynasty within The Elder Scrolls universe.</p>
<p>"Oversee your subjects and make rulings as the years come and go, families grow, and new rulers take the throne," the team teases.</p>
<p>In related news, Bethesda boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> recently confirmed there's no Elder Scrolls TV adaptation in the works.</p>
<p>Despite Amazon's Fallout adaptation getting a very positive reception, it doesn't seem likely that other Bethesda properties will be getting the same treatment. During the Fallout premiere in Los Angeles, Howard was asked if fans could expect TV adaptations from other Bethesda franchises, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-fallout-tv-success-an-elder-scrolls-series-seems-unlikely">such as Elder Scrolls</a>.</p>
<p>"There's nothing in the works," Howard said at the time, before adding: "Everybody asks, like, about Elder Scrolls, and I keep saying no also. And I would approach those - I'll probably say no."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Epic Games Store has finally <a href="http://epic.download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile platforms. Users will find it worldwide on Android and in Europe on iOS, allowing Fortnite to again be available to play on Apple's ecosystem. The date is no coincidence, as today marks the launch of Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 4: Absolute Doom, which is centered on Marvel heroes with Doctor Doom as the main villain.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-to-bring-app-store-changes-thanks-to-digital-markets-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Markets Act</a> allowed the European launch, but Apple still blocks Fortnite and the Epic Games Store elsewhere. Tim Sweeney, CEO and Founder of Epic Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The tide is turning, and the mobile ecosystem is finally opening up to competition. We are grateful to the European Commission for making it possible to launch the Epic Games Store and offer our games to iOS users in the European Union. Now European iOS users and all Android users can access our store and games, as they've always been able to do on open platforms like PC and Mac. The fight is far from over, but this is tangible progress for developers and consumers who can begin to benefit from competition and choice.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-apple-google-fortnite-eu-tim-sweeney?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=147768702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking</a> to Game File, Sweeney said that the fight against Apple and Google cost Epic around $1 billion, but added that it was a 'small' price to pay for the freedom of the company and anyone else interested in a free market.</p>
<p>Epic warned users that the process of installing the Epic Games Store on both Android and iOS is currently pretty convoluted. However, they prepared tutorial videos for each platform.</p>

<p>The Epic Games Store on mobile includes not only Fortnite but also Rocket League: Sideswipe and the brand new Fall Guys for mobile. There's a promotional offer valid until November 2 that rewards gamers who install and play the games on the new store and then complete in-game challenges to unlock a few outfits.</p>
<p>Moreover, Epic is partnering with third party mobile app stores to bring its games to every marketplace. This begins today with the launch of Epic's games on AltStore PAL for iOS users in the European Union. Epic also plans to bring the games to Aptoide's iOS store in the EU and the ONE store on Android.</p>

<p>In an update on social media platform X by Game File's Stephen Totilo, the reporter shared a statement from Krafton's PR, which said those 50 staff who are part of the transfer will "continue to work on new projects, including the expansion of the Hi-Fi Rush IP, at Krafton".</p>
<p>In a separate email shared earlier this week, Totilo said the deal to purchase the Tokyo-based team had been in effect since 1st August, despite it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">only becoming public knowledge on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Krafton's chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae called the deal an "acqui-hire" - a portmanteau of 'acquisition' and 'hiring' - during an earnings call held this week.</p>
<p>As shared within Totilo's newsletter, Bae said Krafton "wanted to inherit the entire development team", and a more traditional acquisition wasn't possible because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Tango Gameworks had been closed down by Microsoft</a>.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Also from their PR: "KRAFTON plans to transfer approximately 50 development staff from Tango Gameworks to KRAFTON's Japan subsidiary. These transferred staff will continue to work on new projects, including the expansion of the HI-FI RUSH IP, at KRAFTON."</p>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1824108474868908472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Tango Gameworks, which is also known for the likes of the Evil Within series, was founded by Shinji Mikami in 2010. In 2012, Bethesda parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resi-evil-creator-mikami-joins-zenimax">ZeniMax Media purchased Tango</a>, before it was then itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buying-zenimax-parent-company-of-bethesda-id-software-and-more-report">acquired by Microsoft</a> years later.</p>
<p>Under Microsoft, Tango surprise launched Hi-Fi Rush last year to wide acclaim.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-499/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may not be released during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-miss-early-2025-launch/">current fiscal year ending in March 2025</a>, but it may still launch in the first half of the year, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Tokyo Security analyst Hideki Yasuda said in a <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202408150860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report</a> that the console should be released in the first half of the year for $499. As such, if the console won't indeed launch in the current fiscal year, it should become available between April and June.</p>
<p>As far as official information goes, very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2, not even its official name. The system will deliver a level of performance <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-software-impact/">not too different from the Steam Deck</a>, although the console's stronger GPU and weaker CPU, compared to Valve's system, will make it run games at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">a higher resolution but lower framerate</a>. The console is also said to support NVIDIA DLSS and Ray Reconstruction, which should give it an edge in a variety of situations, potentially making it superior to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X when it comes to ray tracing.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will let you know more about the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> is finally back on iOS, just over four years after Apple booted it from the iOS App Store — but it’s only available in the EU. The game is launching today on both a new iPhone version of the Epic Games Store and through AltStore PAL, another third-party app store. The Epic Games Store is also launching today for Android users worldwide.</p><p>The launch follows years of litigation between Epic and Apple, as well as regulatory changes ushered in by the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which forced Apple to allow <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act">alternate app stores</a>. Epic plans to eventually bring its games to Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and the ONE Store on Android and says<strong> </strong>in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fsite%2Fen-US%2Fnews%2Fthe-epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile">a blog post</a> that “we look forward to bringing our games to other stores around the world.”</p><p>“We’re really excited and grateful for the European DMA law,” Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a briefing with reporters. “<em>Fortnite</em> is finally returning to iOS in Europe.”</p><p>There is a catch: after scanning the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile">QR code from Epic’s website</a>, a popup appears saying “to install the Epic Games Store on your iPhone, update to iOS 17.6 or later.” This conflicts with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">Epic’s own FAQ</a> that says the Games Store can be installed on “iPhones running iOS 17.4 or later.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the revived iOS version of <em>Fortnite</em> is launching just in time for the new<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom">Marvel-themed season</a>, giving EU players a potentially major reason to come back to the game on Apple’s mobile platform. Sweeney said that Epic foresees “absolutely no trouble of being able to update <em>Fortnite</em> simultaneously, worldwide.” In addition to <em>Fortnite, </em>European iPhone owners and global Android users will be able to download Epic’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"><em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em></a> and a new title, a mobile version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"><em>Fall Guys</em></a>, from the Epic Games Store.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>Fall Guys<em> is now available on mobile for the first time.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Epic Games</cite></p></div><div><p>Since Epic announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050800/epic-games-store-fortnite-apple-ios-launch-eu-dma">its plans</a> for an iOS store, Apple has repeatedly slowed the process down. In March, Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092158/epic-apple-developer-account-terminated-digital-markets-act-alternative-ios-app-store">shut down an Epic developer account</a> and called the company “verifiably untrustworthy,” perhaps alluding to Epic knowingly breaking Apple’s rules with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"><em>Fortnite </em>in-app payment system</a> that got it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">kicked off iOS</a>. Apple reinstated Epic’s account <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094543/epic-games-ios-developer-license-apple-dma">after an inquiry from the European Commission</a>, but it later took issue with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/6/24193182/apple-approved-epic-games-store-notarized-eu-dma-fortnite">the Epic Games Store’s buttons</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><p>While the mobile Epic Games Store currently has just three first-party games, the company is already in discussions with third-party mobile developers. Epic aims to have a “curated” selection of third-party games on the mobile store in December, VP and Epic Games Store GM Steve Allison said, with self-publishing (which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23630864/epic-games-store-self-publish-tools-ratings">is already possible on PC</a>) set to arrive in early 2025. Epic also plans to bring over “everything” it offers on PC, like its 88 percent revenue share for developers, free games for players, and the option for developers to use their own payment platforms. It’s aiming for 100 million net new Epic Games Store mobile installations by the end of the year, Allison said, though that could be hampered by hurdles in Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games">third-party installation process</a>.</p><p>To succeed, Epic will need developers to brave Apple’s fees for venturing outside the App Store. If a developer wants to list their app on a third-party store, they must pay Apple a “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051823/apple-third-party-app-stores-50-cent-fee">Core Technology Fee</a>” of €0.50 per year for each install after the first million. This fee applies to app installs on both third-party app stores <em>and</em> the App Store, which could add up quickly if you have a successful app on the App Store and want to offer your app through an outside marketplace. “The effect of that is to dissuade any developer of a current, successful game from putting their game on any store that competes with the iOS App Store,” Sweeney said.</p><p>Apple also announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216181/apple-eu-app-store-services-fee-external-links">additional new fees</a> last week. “We’d like to use the walled garden terminology, but these core tech fees and the new things introduced last week made the wall a little bit higher, and maybe [Apple] put some barbed wire on top,” Allison said.</p><p>For Epic, it’s worth scaling that wall. According to court documents, <em>Fortnite</em> on iOS made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone">more than $700 million</a> over the two years before Apple yanked it from the store. While <em>Fortnite</em> will certainly have a much smaller audience on an EU-only third-party store, Epic will get 100 percent of the revenues from in-app purchases instead of paying Apple’s usual 30 percent App Store cut. Some of that revenue will go toward Apple’s fees, but Epic is big enough to weather them. And if regulation, competitive pressures, or public sentiment force Apple to soften its byzantine rules for third-party app stores, Epic will be one of the biggest, earliest players in the field.</p><p>But so far, many third-party developers seem leery. Allison said that Epic is in active discussions with “just about every single one” of the top 250 mobile developers. And while the developers are “very enthusiastic” about the Epic Games Store on Android, “almost all of them” said they can’t make it work on iOS.</p><p>Epic knows it’s got a long way to go. The company has already spent hundreds of millions in its fight with Apple, according to Sweeney. And Allison acknowledged there’s still a huge amount of friction for players and developers. “But our vision for the future is we’re going to keep fighting,” Allison said. “We’re going to make progress. We are confident that over time, we will get these things eradicated. But we don’t know if it’s going to be two months or two years or longer, but we certainly hope it’s one of the shorter ones.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 kicked off today, August 16, and here’s everything new in the Absolute Doom season, including POIs, Marvel Weapons, Mythics, battle pass details and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 4 - Absolute Doom | Official Season Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uE0XFJSVZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-pois">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 POIs</h2>



<p>In the latest season of Fortnite, Dr. Doom and his army are the main villains. Dr. Doom has introduced new points of interest (POIs) in Chapter 5, Season 4, to strengthen his control over the island. The first addition is Castle Doom, a towering structure casting a massive shadow over the island. Next is The Raft, a maximum security prison that Doom has brought to the island to recruit more evil characters. Lastly, there’s Doomstadt, a Latverian Village run by Doom. Players will also find a Fantastic Four easter egg in this area.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-weapons">Marvel Weapons</h2>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 has unvaulted old Marvel weapons and introduced new ones. First is the return of Dr Doom’s Gauntlets and Captain America’s shield; both weapons have been updated with new capabilities. Then we see new additions to the Marvel weapons pool, which include Gwenpool’s Dual Micro SMGs and War Machine’s Arsenal, Auto Turret and Hover Jets.&nbsp;Moreover, we also saw Black Panther’s claws as a new melee weapon in the latest trailer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-medallions-and-mythics">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Medallions and Mythics</h2>



<p>Three new medallions and mythics in the latest Fortnite season can be claimed by defeating three bosses. First is Doombot in Castle Doom; defeating him will grant you the Siphon Medallion and the Monarch Pistol. Then we have Emma Frost at The Raft, who players can defeat to acquire the Reveal Medallion and the Striker Burst Rifle. Third, Mysterio at Doomstadt can be defeated for the Stealth Medallion and the Sovereign Shotgun.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-absolute-doom-battle-pass">Absolute Doom Battle Pass</h2>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4’s Battle Pass will cost players 950 V Bucks and let players earn up to 1,500 V Bucks as they level up. Players can earn XP across Battle Royale, Creator-Made Islands, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival. Levelling up through the latest battle pass will grant you skins like Gwenpool, War Machine, Peelverine, Emma Frost, Captain Jonesy, Mysterio and Shuri. Dr Doom will also be available later in the season through special Battle Pass Quests in September. The last day for progressing through the Absolute Doom Battle Pass is&nbsp; November 1 at 11 PM PT / November 2 at 2 AM ET.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Two Legacy of Kain games are being re-released, but for the Evercade retro handheld console.
</p>
<p>
The Legacy of Kain Collection will include both Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver on one giga cart priced £22.49.
</p>
<p>
The collection will release next month and will be <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/legacy-of-kain-collection/">available to pre-order</a> from 30th August. It's compatible with all Evercade and Super Pocket devices.

<p>

The two games mark the first entries in the Legacy of Kain saga, which began with Blood Omen in 1996. The follow-up, Soul Reaver, was helmed by Amy Hennig and has become a cult classic, with fans desperate for a re-release or remake.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, at last month's Comic-Con San Diego, logos for an unannounced "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remaster-hints-surface-at-comic-con">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</a>" were included on display plaques accompanying statues of characters from the games, leading to much speculation.

</p>
<p>
The games' developer Crystal Dynamics also released a survey to fans in 2022 to gauge interest in a potential revival of the series. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-hears-legacy-of-kain-fans-loudly-and-clearly-following-huge-survey-response">received a huge response</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Rest assured," said Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers, "we hear you loudly and clearly, and we'll continue to update you on the 'what if' possibilities ahead for Legacy of Kain in the future."

</p>
<p>
This Evercade re-release of the original games may not be the full remake fans were hoping for, but it's at least some movement in the right direction. Eurogamer's Ian Higton has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-fitness-games-old-classics-and-dungeons-dragons">already got his hands on the Evercade versions</a>: "I know exactly what I'll be doing on my flight to Gamescom next week," he said. "Imagine it: playing a PS1 game on a plane on a handheld device. The future is now - the future is retro!"

</p>
<p>
The collection is the second release from Blaze Entertainment and Crystal Dynamics, following Tomb Raider Collection 1, which includes the first three of Lara Croft's adventures.

            <p>
Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has said he has "no regrets" over his company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">decision to break Apple and Google's terms of service back in August 2020</a> - something that saw the hugely-popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> booted off both iPhone and Android storefronts.
</p>
<p>
The carefully choreographed stunt sparked four years of legal wrangling over Apple and Google's app store policies - and has ultimately led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year">Epic Games launching its own mobile store today</a> on Android worldwide and on iPhone in mainland Europe, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">policy changes demanded of Apple by the EU</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We've probably lost a billion dollars not having Fortnite on iOS the past four years," Sweeney said, in a briefing to press ahead of the Epic Games Store on mobile going live. "But what's the price of freedom?"
</p>
<p>
Today, Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe and a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> mobile version (cross-compatible with the existing PC and console editions) will be the first games available in the Epic Game Store on smartphones. Other, non-Epic Games titles will then become available later this year.
</p>
<p>
"We've set a goal of 100m new installs across Android and iOS before the end of the year," explained Steve Allison, Epic Game Store's VP, General Manager. "We think we could do that in a world where everything was a level playing field, and we're still trying to drive at that number. The only thing standing in our way is the friction Apple and Google are putting in front of us - and it's pretty significant."

Epic Games is still unhappy about a variety of things - including a fiddly process to install its alternative storefront on iPhone that it says requires 15 steps. This is in comparison to the handful of taps necessary to download a game from the in-built App Store. 
</p>
<p>
First, you'll need to head to Epic Games' website (again, this is if you're on Android, or on an iOS device in the EU - apologies, UK readers) and hit the install Epic Games Store button. On iPhone, this will bring up the first of several "scare screens" - ominous-looking warnings that tell you the process requires you to go change your device settings. It's not a difficult process, but it's fair to say Apple could make it more straightforward - and the warnings seem deliberately worded to dissuade casual users from continuing. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' hope, it seems, is that Fortnite (and also Rocket League and Fall Guys) are big enough draws that people push through the above 15 steps to get playing the company's games again on their phones. And, once again, there's more careful choreography at play - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-marvel-confirm-new-crossover-season-starring-doctor-doom-as-disney-integration-deepens">today also being the big launch of Fortnite's new Marvel-infused season</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're going to invest in getting hundreds of millions of players through the gate," Allison continued, "and we're working super hard across the board to get third-party developers to join us". 
</p>
<p>
But, on iPhone especially, Epic Games faces an uphill battle still. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">Sweeney has previously railed against Apple's "junk fees on downloads and new Apple taxes"</a> that are currently set to penalise any developers who want to launch an app on the Epic Games Store for mobile as well as on the App Store. (Memorably, Sweeney dubbed these fees as "hot garbage".) 
</p>
<p>
"Of the top 250 developers we've been targeting to bring their apps to the Epic Game Store, everybody's excited about coming to our store on Android because there's no imposition of 'junk fees' just for the purpose of going to a competing store," Sweeney told press this week. "Zero of them have expressed a willingness to come to the Epic Game Store on iOS - it's just uneconomical. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple has set these fees in order to make it vastly more expensive, not just to do business on the Epic Game Store, but if you come to the Epic Game Store you're penalised on the iOS App Store. They make their store terms worse for the privilege of trying to compete with them. Obviously it makes no competitive sense, its anti-competitive."
</p>
<p>Exactly how much further Apple will change its policies remains to be seen, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-opens-fresh-investigation-into-apple-following-further-non-compliance-claims">EU continues to take a close interest in how the mobile maker is implementing the changes it has been required to make</a> as a result of the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Today's launch gives Epic Games a foot in the door, for now, an the company says it is hopeful of further markets opening up next year, including the UK and Japan.</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Apple has behaved "dishonestly and maliciously", Sweeney continued. "If you give Apple the arbitary power to block competitors' access to the platform, of course they can block whoever they want. That power needs to be taken away from them."
</p>
<p>
Today also sees Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys also become available on the first of several other, smaller third-party mobile stores (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-is-pulling-fortnite-from-rent-collector-mobile-stores-as-it-readies-own-eu-shop">though no longer major player Samsung</a>), as Epic Games seeks to demonstrate it is fighting for wider change, rather than just its own slice of the app store market.
</p>
<p>
So, you can also now nab the above three games from indie app store Altstore, an enterprise co-founded by Riley Testut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-game-emulator-currently-top-free-download-on-iphone-app-store">creator of the Delta emulator</a>, which Apple initially blocked. Other apps from Altstore include a mobile Torrent app.
</p>
<p>
"I've no regrets, Apple had to be challenged," Sweeney concluded, reflecting on the past four years. "Before we directly challenged Apple and pointed out to the world exactly what their practices were, a lot of people just read Apple's marketing and thought the App Store was a normal store like any other. They didn't realise that it was, in effect, banning any other competition. And because all app developers passed on their 30 percent fees to their customers, no one understood the App Store inflated prices for anything users come into contact with. 
</p>
<p>"The way we challenged Apple and Google - we introduced Epic Direct Payment and passed on 20 percent savings to all our customers - immediately turned the conversation to these 'junk fees' increasing the cost of software and the monopoly nature of its App Store. By Apple blocking Fortnite from a billion devices they proved to the world they do have a monopoly to access to software for a billion users. Similarly by Google blocking Fortnite they established they did have a monopoly. 
</p>
<p>
"When you look at everything that's happened since, you can trace a lot of it back - not only to regulators, but also consumers coming to a really clear realisation of the insidious nature of what [Apple/Google] call 'walled gardens' but we should just simply call monopolies in the fields of software distribution and payment processing, and how they've really corrupted the whole digital ecosystem compared to the days of really open platforms, such as Windows and the open web."
</p>
<p>
  Epic Games isn't the only company launching a new mobile storefront. While delayed beyond its expected launch date, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft is still working on its own store for smartphones</a> - and it will be interesting to see if Fortnite will end up on there. "The standard for us is - great terms for all developers," Allison said, when asked. "We don't know their terms yet."
</p>
<p>"If [the terms] are great, we'll come," concluded Sweeney. "If they're not great, we won't come."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When Telltale Games collapsed in 2018, four developers stepped in to acquire the rights to Sam &amp; Max. Skunkape Games, as they are known, set about rereleasing the Sam &amp; Max series — three seasons each of which was originally released in episodic form, following the sitular dog detective and his&nbsp;lagomorph pal. Now the third and final season has been rereleased, asking once again: “if any one of us could unlock the power of the mind, would we use it to unlock the powers of the infinite… or would we use it to destroy?”</p>
<p><iframe title="Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered! Now available!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzXbwm0P65E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you have played either of the two previous seasons —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/20/sam-max-save-the-world-remastered-switch-review/">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</a> or Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space, you can very quickly guess which one plays out.</p>


<p>If you haven’t had the pleasure, Sam &amp; Max are freelance police. Sam is a cool, calm and collected bipedal dog in a suit. Max is the embodiment of chaos, a hyperkinetic rabbity thing, and — naturally — the President of the US. The have relatively little regard for the law, and pretty much just stroll around performing an overly elaborate and complex set of point-and-click tasks in order to achieve their goals.</p>


<p>At the beginning of Chapter 1 of The Devil’s Playhouse, The Penal Zone, Max picks up a kid’s toy that allows him to see into the future. Little did he know that the Eyes of Yog Sogoth that he just grabbed would also unlock his psychic powers. As the game progresses, he picks up playing cards that grant mindreading, a telephone that transports them to another phone and a rhinoplasty toy that lets them shapeshift — all amusing little plays on what the item does for everyone else, and an insight into the playfulness of Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell’s brain.</p>
<p>The problem is that these Toys of Power are being sought by an evil and powerful space gorilla, General Skun-ka’pe. He lands on your street, tries to claim the toys and even steal Max’s brain so that he can wield the Toys of Power for himself.</p>

<p>What follows is a joyous campaign of puerile humour and anarchistic problem solving. Case in point: when Skun-ka’pe brags to his queen that after locking Sam and Max in an intergalactic prison and blowing it up with an antimatter bomb, “I took care of the&nbsp;Penal Zone in one stroke”. Max walks past and snidely comments on the unfortunate choice of words.</p>
<p>But all of this was true when the game was first released in 2010. So how does 2024’s remaster shape up?</p>
<p>The answer is incredibly well. As with the previous remasters, most of the changes are technical, bringing the graphics from 1024×768 4:3 to high-res 16:9. The lighting, lip sync and audio have all been drastically improved, with the audio in particular shining through. That said, it’s not all just higher resolutions. Character models have been tweaked, new credits and menus have been added and the whole thing feels a little more connected as a result, and closer to Steve Purcell’s original vision. We know this because Skunkape said they had Purcell’s input along the way.</p>

<p>On top of this, a ‘new’ Toy of Power that didn’t make it to the original PC version is now available in the Nutri-Specs, along with a bunch of more spoiler-y additions that we won’t go into.</p>
<p>There’s not really much to complain about here. The intros are still unskippable, and the run button feels like it’s in the wrong place – I still don’t understand why running isn’t the default. Beyond that, there’s minor gripes with trophies not popping on the PS5, but that’s not the end of the world.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Sam and Max: The Devil’s Playhouse is exactly what you want from a remaster. It has been faithfully rebuilt, adding improvements and things that make sense, and tightening the things that were a little leaky. I loved stepping back into Sam’s (lack of) shoes and holding the world to rights as a newly psychic Max. If you don’t mind a bit of juvenile humour, this is still one of the funniest point-and-click adventures I’ve ever played, but a little prettier than I remember.	</p></div>
