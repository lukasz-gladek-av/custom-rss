<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battle has all the players scrambling for alternate paths for all eight characters. These paths allow you to explore a completely new storyline, very different from what players are used to in the canon series. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battle guide will help you better understand all the different branching paths for Goku in the Android/Cell Saga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before getting into it, players should know that these branching routes can only be unlocked by completing certain tasks or challenges during battle. Additionally, completing an entire branching episode rewards you with 100,000 Zeni, a bunch of XP, and other items. This guide will take you through all the different paths available for Goku in the Android/Cell Saga and the conditions you must meet to unlock them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-canon-story-line">Canon Story Line</h2>



<p>To follow the canon storyline for Goku in Sparking Zero’s Android/Cell Saga, players need to make decisions according to the events that occurred in the anime. When Gohan and Goku wait to enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, they suddenly realise that Piccolo is in trouble. Here, you are given two options: “Go Help” or “Wait for Vegeta and the others”. If you choose “Wait for Vegeta and the others”, events will follow the same path as the anime.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-changing-future">The Changing Future</h2>



<p>To explore this path for Goku in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles, players must select the ‘Go Help’ option. Once you have chosen this path, a new line of events pops up, where Goku and Gohan go save Piccolo instead of entering the Hyperbolic Time Chamber to train. Goku uses his Instant Transmission to reach Piccolo and then starts fighting Cell.</p>



<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. For players that don’t want to know what happens next, skip to the <em>Homecoming</em> paragraph.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Goku and Gohan abandon training on this path, and Goku goes to fight Cell alone. He somehow manages to overcome Cell, and that’s when Android 16, 17, and 18 want to kill him. However, Goku easily defeats them, too, leading to the trio’s withdrawal from battle. Teen Gohan cannot become the formidable warrior we know and love in this storyline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-homecoming-nbsp">Homecoming&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Homecoming is an additional ending you can get for Goku in Sparking Zero, but it isn’t an entire path. To get this ending, you need to defeat Cell before the elapsed time is over. If you manage to do so, Goku doesn’t have to die to save Earth, and you will also receive a wholesome cutscene where Goku, Gohan, and Chi Chi are reunited after the Cell Games.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month.1007775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As of next month, Microsoft is allowing those who utilize Xbox Cloud Gaming to stream their own games. The company is doing this as a test, first and foremost, but this could be a game changer financially for their gaming department. It's not an unknown secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-to-cut-another-650-jobs-mostly-in-corporate-and-support-games-wont-be-affected/">their gaming sector</a> is under-performing compared to the other sectors within Microsoft. They are now trying to do everything in their power to remedy that, and it seems that allowing those to stream games that aren't already a part of the Xbox Game Pass library using Xbox Cloud Gaming is part of that strategy.</p>
<p>This particular idea has been part of the long-term project known as Project Lapland inside Microsoft. They have been working on Xbox Cloud Gaming servers to make sure they are stable enough to support streaming thousands of different games, all varying in graphical fidelity and compatibility. It was already mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-for-owned-games-is-coming-this-year-says-spencer/">around seven months ago</a> that this change would be coming, and it's clear that they've been working on changes in Xbox Cloud Gaming, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-rolls-out-mouse-and-keyboard-support-for-26-games/">recently rolled out support for Mouse and Keyboard</a> in a number of games.</p>
<p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion will be happening in the same month that Microsoft plans to enable game purchases in the box mobile app for Android in the US after a lengthy court case that <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/">finally forced Google</a> to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store. This change is huge, and will be finally taking place on November 1. While to many, this may seem like an insignificant change, it means that third-party stores will finally be able to function on the Play Store, something that hasn't been possible for years without managing your payments and subscriptions via Google Play Billing.</p>
<p>Xbox President Sarah Bond revealed that players will be able to play and purchase games from the Xbox App on Android. Microsoft is still ironing out the wrinkles, but once they are done, those who buy the game will be able to stream it to their device immediately.</p>
<p>This update has been in the works for a long time. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-studios-publishing-unveils-cloud-gaming-division-headed-by-kim-swift/">Microsoft first announced</a> this ground-breaking feature of playing your own library of games on Xbox Cloud Gaming in 2022. However, due to a number of complications within the company and the pandemic, it didn't launch that year, and it's only happening now, two years later. There will be thousands of games available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Warren reports at The Verge</a> that some publishers are holding specific games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p>

The company has added a note on the payment checkout screen stating that “a purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-tells-gamers-up-front-that-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-085106522.html?guccounter=1">as reported earlier by <em>Engadget</em></a>.</p><p>We confirmed the message appears in the Steam desktop app, but we haven’t seen it in the mobile app yet. Some Steam users noticed the disclosure go live earlier this week and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0qskq/steam_now_shows_that_you_dont_own_games/">posted their findings on Reddit</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>My colleague Sean is not actually buying this yet; he says he has to play </em>Persona 3<em> first.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Steam</cite></p></div><p>Why? Probably, a new law. California has a law <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426">going into effect next year</a> that’ll require digital storefronts like Valve’s Steam platform to clearly say that you’re only purchasing a license for your digital media because some companies like Ubisoft and PlayStation were removing digital purchases from users’ libraries, keeping them from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-is-deleting-the-crew-from-players-libraries-reminding-us-we-own-nothing-165328083.html">playing games like <em>The Crew</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989290/playstation-digital-ownership-sucks">watching their old Discovery shows</a>.</p><p>The law does <em>not</em> apply to games where you can download an offline installer that can be used without connecting to the internet, like with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2F">Good Old Games’ DRM-free game store</a>.</p><p>There’s speculation Valve went live with the new message to get ahead of the law. The law states digital storefronts must not say you can “buy” or “purchase” something unless that something is a license, and it must link to the terms and conditions of the license — which Valve already seems to have covered.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It seems like every major release wants to become the only game you play for, at the very least, a month before you move on to the next big title. But the problem is there’s something new around every corner. But the JRPG genre doesn’t care about upcoming titles; they live in a world of their own making, and in that world, single-player RPGs span nearly one hundred hours or more. Here’s how long it takes to beat Metaphor: ReFantazio!</p>







<p>If you’ve set the lofty goal of beating Metaphor: ReFantazio shortly after launch, I hope you’re ready for the challenge. The monolithic RPG requires anywhere from 70-80 hours to finish a single playthrough. Some players report taking slightly less time, around 60 hours, and others report finishing in upwards of 100 hours. It depends primarily on your playstyle; how do you enjoy running through an RPG of this immense scope?</p>



<p>I intend to take my time and whittle away at the campaign in the spare hours I can eke out when my little one finally falls asleep, so I suspect it’ll take me months to finish the game!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-all-achievements-in-metaphor-refantazio-and-how-to-unlock-them">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/achievements-metaphor-refantazio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Achievements in Metaphor: ReFantazio and How to Unlock Them</a></h6>







<figure><figcaption>Image via ATLUS</figcaption></figure>



<p>Have you ever played any of the Persona titles? ATLUS, the developer behind Metaphor: ReFantazio, is known for its previous RPG franchise, which follows a group of teenagers dealing with the supernatural. But Metaphor: ReFantazio, while offering the same style of gameplay, as a massive JRPG, sets itself apart as a fantasy-themed adventure. It does retain a similar graphical style and overall gameplay feel, with third-person exploration, large-scale zones, and turn-based combat, but it crafts a new, enthralling adventure of its own!</p>



<p>Have you had a chance to play Metaphor: ReFantazio yet? Let us know your thoughts on the game in the comments below, or visit our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> to discuss this and other JRPGs!</p>

<p>If you are new to Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, check out the new Episode Battle system, where players can either follow events of the anime or discover a branching path that leads to a brand new conclusion. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guide will cover Vegeta’s branching paths in the Android/Cell Saga.</p>



<p>Players looking to explore these alternative paths for characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles must achieve specific goals during their battles to unlock these new routes. Moreover, the game rewards players who complete these branching paths with an additional 100,000 Zeni, a boatload of XP and some additional items. This guide will explore all the different paths you can take for Vegeta in Android/Cell Saga and the conditions you must meet to unlock them.</p>

<h2 id="h-canon-story-line">Canon Story Line</h2>



<p>Players don’t have to do much to follow the canon path when playing with Vegeta, as his missions are pretty straightforward until the Android/Cell Arc. However, once Vegeta turns Super Saiyan, you will face the first alternative path choice for this character in his battle against Android 18. To follow the canon storyline, do not defeat Android 18 in the elapsed time, and the events will follow the same path as the anime.</p>



<h2 id="h-parental-bond">Parental Bond</h2>



<p>If you can defeat Android 18 before the match ends, players will explore a new path for Vegeta’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode battles: Parental Bond. However, there is one more task players need to complete before they can completely explore this alternative path.</p>



<p>Once players defeat Android 18, Vegeta decides to train with Future Trunks in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Players must defeat Trunks as quickly as possible during this battle to unlock the branching path completely. If they cannot, they will revert to the canon storyline.</p>



<p>To know whether you have accomplished the challenge, you must pay attention to Trunk’s dialogue options. He will continue to hold back against Vegeta if you don’t deal enough damage. However, if you can inflict enough damage, Trunks shows his Super transformation to Vegeta, thus unlocking the new path. You must complete These two tasks to unlock this branching path.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead for the Parental Bond Episode</em></strong></p>



<p>After you defeat Trunks, you witness a new exchange between Vegeta and him. Vegeta acknowledges Future Trunks’ strength and confesses that he knew Trunks was his son. He asks Trunks to train with him in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber so that both can ascend to a level even higher than a Super Saiyan.</p>



<p>Vegeta and Trunks then confront Cell as they did in the anime; however, the encounter is a bit different. Vegeta allows Cell to transform into his Perfect Form as he canonically does; however, this time, he gives Cell a decent fight, enough for Cell to back off and announce the Cell Games Martial Arts tournament.</p>

<h2 id="h-father-son-final-flash">Father Son Final Flash</h2>



<p>Vegeta and Trunks train together to become even stronger until the Cell Games begin. Once they kick off, Vegeta is the show’s star, taking on Cell first and giving him a run for his money. However, Vegeta falls short against the Android and is almost about to die at his hands. At that moment, Trunks intervenes, taking the hit instead of Vegeta, becoming critically wounded.</p>



<p>Seeing his son in pain, Vegeta is enraged like never before and is ready to end Cell. He transforms into Super Saiyan 2 and dukes it out with the villain. The decision of the battle is left to a clash between Cell’s Kamehameha and Vegeta’s Final Flash. It seemed Vegeta would lose for a moment, but in the dying seconds, Trunks backs his father with his Final Flash, and the Father-Son Final Flash finally defeats Cell once and for all.</p>

It will reportedly also be available as DLC for gamers who already purchased Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>The report suggests that the Definitive Edition and associated DLC may arrive as soon as 2025 in part because Warner Bros. Games wants to offset the ongoing losses that occurred from the massive underperformance of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-loot-world-order/1900-6418174/" data-ref-id="1900-6418174">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. As recently as last month, Warner Bros. has stated that making a Hogwarts Legacy sequel is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">a top priority</a>." Getting the DLC out may make the wait between the first game and its follow-up more bearable.</p><p>While the franchise also has an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-series-aiming-to-release-in-2026/1100-6521317/" data-ref-id="1100-6521317">upcoming Harry Potter TV series</a> on HBO, the characters and the world created by J.K. Rowling have often been overshadowed by the author's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">anti-trans views</a>, which she continuously shares online and via social media. This has put her at odds with several of the actors from the Harry Potter films, as well as a large number of her fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/europa-short-and-sweet-wind-swept-journey<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Novadust Entertainment's first title,&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="162a359a-9322-42fc-b250-b20094c18466" href="https://techraptor.net/games/europa">Europa</a>, </em>effortlessly combines narrative exploration with 3D platforming. The terraformed moon is gorgeous, with sweeping vistas, waterfalls, snow capped mountains, and magical ponds. It features easy to pick up mechanics with no consequences for failing, coupled with an emotive narrative ready to wet your eyes.</p>
<h2>Nostalgic Notes from Father to Son</h2>
<p>You play as Zee, the son of Adam, who is heading to the floating island above Europa. Armed with the Zephyr backpack, you'll glide and hover your way through the different areas of&nbsp;<em>Europa.&nbsp;</em>Missing your father, you head to the island, where Adam directed him to go when Zee feels the time is right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mechanics are easy to pick up, primarily centered around gliding and hovering using energy gathered in the environment. There are aggressive AI constructs, but you can't die, only lose energy from Zephyr. This lack of fatality instills a relaxing vibe to the game, even though there are platforming elements that may evoke stress under different circumstances.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-environment.jpg?itok=a_AyH5SC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-environment.jpg?itok=BJ1NV0U- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The story unfolds as you collect Adam's diary entries, left behind for Zee to find. The entries are marked with a column of gold light, making them easy to find in wide open spaces. Some can be hidden, but the story has a review when you leave one region to enter another. There were four of these review periods that summed up the diary entries, ensuring the critical plot details were known as the game progresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The narrative does get emotional as you near the Island. I didn't expect to be moved to tears, but I was. The story pulls at the heartstrings in all the right ways. You become invested in the father and son story, their relationship, and their experiences on&nbsp;terraforming&nbsp;the moon. Truly, the writing of&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is one of its strengths.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-zee-mind.jpg?itok=g2aBsApx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-zee-mind.jpg?itok=ahmKMtiL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Whimsical Environment</h2>
<p>The art of&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;further establishes the relaxing and stress free feeling of the game. The hills are a soft green, animals and friendly terraforming robots roam around crystal clear ponds. Fluffy clouds dot the sky and moss grows on the remnants of human buildings. The colors aren't harsh to look at and evoke the feeling of spring days. Even the harsher snow region is idyllic in design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cutscenes and certain animal snapshots exude a magical feeling while playing. Similar to seeing an elephant at the zoo, these instances felt like rare occurrences that should be treasured. Given context with the story, the cutscenes were even more awe-inspiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matching the visual environment is the music, instrumentals that conjure images of quiet evenings, picnics with friends, lazy sun-kissed afternoons, and restful nights. It further reinforces the relaxing nature of&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>, even as I struggled to avoid energy steal bombs. I didn't lose this feeling at any point in time during my playthrough. Often with platformers I become frustrated, but this didn't occur even once while making my way to the Island.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-deer.jpg?itok=pIg5W3jB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-deer.jpg?itok=Ej4ATMl_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Europa is a Sentimental Bite-Sized Game</h2>
<p>For those with limited gaming time or who prefer shorter titles,&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is a title to explore. The main story can be completed in 3-4 hours, with more time investment for those that prefer collecting all the Emeralds, Zephyr upgrades, or earning every achievement. I completed it in three and a half hours with some extra exploration and struggles with some of the platforming (darn you jumping). Parents could potentially start and finish&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;during one solid nap time.</p>
<p>Players who prefer longer stories will still like&nbsp;<em>Europa.</em>&nbsp;While it has a shorter playtime, the story is complete from start to finish. There aren't any side quests, but there are multiple items to collect, sketches to draw, and enemies to flawlessly avoid. On top of that, it's such a relaxing title that it can serve as a palate cleanser between larger, more involved narrative games.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-snow-fox.jpg?itok=J3mRcWNR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-snow-fox.jpg?itok=sCE2N5eW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The only downfall that I really experienced while playing&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;were the instances of forced perspective when moving through certain areas. Typically, you have complete control over your camera angle, with the ability to look around the immediate environment. At certain points in the game, however, the camera shifts automatically, which can be disadvantageous to what you're trying to view or do at that point in time. This occurs a handful of times and may not be a bother to all players, but is something you may want to consider.</p>
<p><em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is a fully realized story with interesting characters, easy to grasp <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="20c4837f-e0cc-430f-ba11-3f7a140d6674" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/return-of-3d-platformer"><strong>3D platforming</strong></a> mechanics, and charming environment. Regardless of how long you like your games,&nbsp;<em>Europa</em>&nbsp;is one to add to your playlist thanks to its relaxing vibe. It is a title to experience, even for those that normally avoid platforming games.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Europa&nbsp;</strong>was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 3.5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is planning to support the streaming of Xbox game libraries next month. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the company is getting ready to test the ability to stream games that you own that aren’t part of the existing Xbox Game Pass library.</p><p>As part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft, the software giant has been readying its Xbox Cloud Gaming servers to be able to support streaming thousands of games. I’m told Microsoft will first test its new Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming capabilities with Xbox Insiders in November, before expanding them to more Xbox users and more games.</p><p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion comes in the same month Microsoft plans to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app for Android in the US. Microsoft is able to do this thanks to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">court ruling</a> earlier this week that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store on November 1st.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed yesterday</a> that “starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.” Once Microsoft’s work to enable a full game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming is complete, you’ll be able to purchase an Xbox game on Android and immediately stream it to your device.</p><p>Project xCloud was <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/14/expanding-project-xcloud-more-games-more-ways-to-play/">supposed to launch</a> with game library streaming in 2020. Microsoft then announced it would support your game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159492/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-library-owned-games-feature">in 2022</a>, but it never launched that year. I understand the work has been complicated by having to prepare key infrastructure for thousands of games, instead of the hundreds that currently exist on Xbox Game Pass. While thousands of games will soon be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I’m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p><p>Microsoft is also working on a browser-based Xbox mobile store that it was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">originally planning to launch in July</a>. The store will initially include deals and in-game items but will grow to cover first-party games eventually.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">Microsoft said in August</a>&nbsp;that testing had begun on the web-based mobile store and that “work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 11th</strong>: Article updated to mention original Project xCloud plans.</em></p><div>

Taking influence from Sony’s <em>Uncharted </em>series (itself inspired by the early <em>Tomb Raider</em> games) and adding survival elements, these three titles helped reinvent Lara Croft’s adventures for a more modern audience. The trilogy turned Lara into not only a skilled treasure hunter but also a tough survivor who has seen a lot of shit, as the very first game, which strands Lara on an island full of mercenaries, makes abundantly clear. All three games are extremely solid adventures that blend compelling combat and delightful puzzle solving, but for my money the best of the three is 2015’s <em>Rise</em>. At $14.99 (or $11.98 on Steam), however, you can play the entire trilogy for a bargain. Also of note is that <em>The Legend of Lara Croft</em> actually picks up after the events of these games, so if you want to know more about the show’s version of Lara, this trilogy will fill you in.</p><p>Nintendo Switch users won’t be able to take advantage of that deal, but that doesn’t mean they can’t get in on the <em>Tomb Raider</em> fun.

These games are classics for a reason and still hold up thanks to their charming pulp stories and satisfying gameplay.

Sandwiched in between the classic era and the most recent reboot trilogy, <em>Underworld </em>has largely gone under the radar in recent years despite being a great take on Lara Croft that can hold its own alongside some of her most famous adventures. At such a low price, you don’t have a good reason not to try it out.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Escape from Tarkov is a challenging enough game as it is, but when you start fooling around at night, it becomes a whole different kettle of fish. Not only do you need to contend with a hail of bullets around every corner, but you also need to battle with suffocating darkness that envelops the map, being guided by moonlight or an incriminating torch beam.</p>



<p>Fans of a daytime raid will hate the newest Tarkov event – it’s designed so that you <strong>must </strong>hunt at night, but the rewards are pretty fantastic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-night-of-the-cult-in-tarkov">Night of the Cult in Tarkov</h2>



<p>In the last few months, a few quests have popped up focusing on the Cultists that stalk certain maps in the dead of night. This latest challenge is no different.</p>



<p>In Night of the Cult, players must eliminate five ‘hooded night people’, otherwise known as Cultists. You can find Cultists on almost every map:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lighthouse</li>



<li>Streets of Tarkov</li>



<li>Night Factory (anywhere)</li>



<li>Customs (ZB-013 extraction)</li>



<li>Woods (near ritual sites)</li>



<li>Shoreline (near Swamp Village and at the resort)</li>



<li>Ground Zero (anywhere)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re able to successfully eliminate five hooded Cultists, you’ll get one hell of a reward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dorm Room 314 Marked Key (5 mil value)</li>



<li>Cult Locust Ballistic Plate</li>



<li>Cult Termite Ballistic Plate</li>



<li>L3Harris GPNVG-18 NVG</li>



<li>12,500 EXP</li>



<li>50,000 roubles</li>
</ul>



<p>If you need to know how to kill Cultists in Tarkov, one key trick will be to <strong>act with caution</strong>. These super agile enemies like to ambush players, and you can’t hear their footsteps, so they’ll sneak up on you as fast as anything. They’re also immune to thermal devices and they have large health pools.</p>



<p>They can use a wide variety of weapons ranging from 7.62 assault rifles to DMRs and handguns, but they’ll almost always try and get close to stab you with a poisoned knife. </p>



<p>Presently, the best place to farm Cultists in Tarkov is on Streets of Tarkov and Ground Zero (LL21 + only). They have a 60% spawn chance on these maps and a 20% spawn chance elsewhere.</p>



<p>Be warned – this is just the beginning of the Halloween-themed Tarkov event. Two heftier tasks follow right after this one. To complete the full line, you’ll need to hunt and kill a whopping 105 Cultists.</p>

          <p>A few years ago, the idea of running PC games on a Mac, in Linux, or on Arm processors would have been laughable. But the developers behind Asahi Linux—the independent project that is getting Linux working on Apple Silicon Macs—have managed to do all three of these things at once.</p>
<p>The feat brings together a perfect storm of open source projects, <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html">according to</a> Asahi Linux GPU lead Alyssa Rosenzweig: the FEX project to translate x86 CPU code to Arm, the Wine project to get Windows binaries running on Linux, DXVK and the Proton project to translate DirectX 12 API calls into Vulkan API calls, and of course the Asahi project's Vulkan-conformant driver for Apple's graphics hardware.</p>
<p>Games are technically run <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/muvm">inside a virtual machine</a> because of differences in how Apple Silicon and x86 systems address memory—Apple's systems use 16 KB memory pages, while x86 systems use 4 KB pages, something that causes issues for Asahi and some other Arm Linux distros on <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Broken-Software">a regular basis</a>&nbsp;and a gap that the VM bridges.</p>

      You'd never guess that this was the Windows version of <em>Fallout 4</em> running on a Mac that was running Linux.

          <p>There comes a point in most experienced Steam shoppers' lives where they wonder what would happen if their account was canceled or stolen, or perhaps <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">they just stopped breathing</a>. It's scary to think about how many games in your backlog will never get played; scarier, still, to think about how you don't, in most real senses of the word, own any of them.</p>
<p>Now Valve, seemingly working to comply with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426">a new California law</a> targeting "false advertising" of "digital goods," has added language to its checkout page to confirm that thinking. "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam," the Steam cart now tells its customers, with a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement further below.</p>

<p><a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426">California's AB2426 law</a>, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom Sept. 26, excludes subscription-only services, free games, and digital goods that offer "permanent offline download to an external storage source to be used without a connection to the internet." Otherwise, sellers of digital goods cannot use the terms "buy, purchase," or related terms that would "confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good." And they must explain, conspicuously, in plain language, that "the digital good is a license" and link to terms and conditions.</p>

However, unlike the guns available in Echoes, Exuviae isn't craftable--so to get your preferred rolls, you're going to need to keep farming more versions of the gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Exuviae is a possible drop from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-onslaught-salvation-guide-potions-banes-and-new-defenses/2900-5849/" data-ref-id="2900-5849">Revenant's Onslaught: Salvation activity</a>. It can come out of reward chests you earn as you work through waves in the mode, but as in the original Onslaught activity, you can also "attune" your rewards to make Exuviae more likely to pop out of those chests. To do that, you need to unlock Tonic recipes in Eido's Apothecary. Taking an Enriching Tonic that focuses on the Exuviae hand cannon will boost how often you get it as a reward from Onslaught for 20 minutes, but you'll first need to get the right recipe. <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=2d6e30c3020bd0f5JmltdHM9MTcyODYwNDgwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNWQ0MGViMC00MWEwLTY1ZGEtMGM0Yi0xZDE2NDA0ZTY0ZDImaW5zaWQ9NTE4NA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=05d40eb0-41a0-65da-0c4b-1d16404e64d2&amp;psq=tonics+guide+gamespot.com&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXNwb3QuY29tL2dhbGxlcnkvZGVzdGlueS0yLXJldmVuYW50LXRvbmljcy1ndWlkZS1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LW1vcmUtdG9uaWMtcmVjaXBlcy1hbmQtZmllbGR3b3JrLzI5MDAtNTg1My8&amp;ntb=1">Check out our Tonics guide</a> to see how to do that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4383353-20241011110629_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383353" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4383353-20241011110629_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383353"></a><figcaption>Exuviae</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4383353-20241011110629_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Exuviae_God_Rolls">Exuviae God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Exuviae_PvP_God_Roll">Exuviae PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +5, Range +5</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Keep Away  <ul><li dir="ltr">Increases reload, range, and accuracy when no enemies are in close proximity.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Precision Instrument  <ul><li dir="ltr">Dealing sustained damage increases precision damage</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Stability</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The power of Exuviae in PvP is in its high effective range. Pumping up the range stat is generally a good idea for PvP weapons, and that pairs very well with Keep Away, which gives you even more benefits from keeping your distance from opponents. Precision Instrument takes further advantage of Keep Away and your range stat, providing a damage boost to your precision hits, so long as you don't miss. With a lot of range and Keep Away active, you'll ideally be engaging other players from distances where they struggle to be as effective as you, and especially if you're accurate, you should knock out other Guardians pretty quickly.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Exuviae_PvE_God_Roll">Exuviae PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flared Magwell  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Reload Speed +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Rimestealer  <ul><li dir="ltr">Destroying a Stasis crystal or defeating a frozen enemy with this weapon grants you Frost Armor.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Headstone  <ul><li dir="ltr">Precision final blows spawn a Stasis crystal at the target's location.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Exuviae carries some seriously useful Stasis synergy, although it relies greatly on landing precision kills to create Stasis crystals as much as possible. The combination of Headstone and Rimestealer is a pretty powerful one: Whenever you use Exuviae to break a Stasis crystal or kill a frozen enemy, you get Frost Armor, making you tougher to kill as a result. Stasis crystals themselves are pretty powerful right now, so this is a gun that can do good work synergizing with a Stasis build and keeping you protected. Amp up its stability stat to make those precision hits a little easier, and boost Handling when possible for fast switches to secondary weapons like grenade launchers.</p>

"Post Void is a masterpiece of compulsive motion and hypnotic, irresistible sounds," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/post-void-review">wrote Sin</a> of YCJY Games's "orgiastic" shooter. "It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/keep-driving">Keep Driving</a> seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and <em>slightly</em> ominous 2D management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

The whole thing seems very spaced-out, for all the excess of menus, but there's the suggestion that Life Lessons of some kind await. "Remember to take it easy," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/">the Steam page</a> remarks, in the manner of somebody smiling and noddling at a toddler to stop them looking at the mushroom cloud behind them. "You're young. You have time."</p>
<p>The game's influences run a boisterous gamut: "Oregon Trail II, FTL, Two Lane Blacktop, Paris Texas, Jalopy, Gloom Haven, The 7th Continent, and the developer's lives". But it all comes together beautifully on the screen, with artfully worn and dusty pixelart backdrops and a catchy inside-outside effect, whereby you're both peering over the dashboard <em>and</em> watching yourself drive. Ah, swish. Here are some bulletpoints:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A procedurally generated pixel art world to explore one road at a time.
</p>
<p>
A nostalgic early 2000s setting with an emphasis on the analogue .
</p>
<p>
Use turn-based 'combat' to solve situations (like getting stuck behind a tractor).
</p>
<p>
Pick up misfits, oddballs and lost souls as you go.
</p>
<p>
Collect songs and listen to a mix CD of local Swedish indie bands.
</p>
<p>
Multiple endings to unlock when you return to the road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I guess the natural foil for this is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a>, which is similarly preoccupied with the art of car maintenance, but also 3D, post-apocalyptic and paranormal. If you enjoy swapping stories with strangers on the road, but think horseless carriages are for chumps, maybe cock a squint at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine">Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</a>.

A lone piece of concept art shows shadowy figures in a cave pointing to golden rays of light. </p><p>Then there was Dark Math Games. This studio is working on a “true detective RPG” called <em>XXX Nightshift</em>. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Steam page</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an actual trailer</a></span>. It claims a headcount of roughly 20 people, about half of which reportedly worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em>.

It also includes ZA/UM writer Dora Klindžić, who had been working with Tuulik on the direct sequel at that studio up until the mass layoffs earlier this year. </p><p> “I’ve seen good work done at ZA/UM,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.si.com/videogames/news/disco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-out&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/disco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Sports Illustrated</em></a></span> at the time. “I’ve also seen management and production staff terrorizing creatives, lying, playing power games, turning people against each other, destroying relationships and people’s self-esteem.” She added, “The mask has slipped from the face of capital. What remains at ZA/UM is a cold, careless company where managers wage war against their own creatives, where artistry is second to property, and where corporate strategy is formed by an arrogant disdain for their own audience.”</p><p>In keeping with that sentiment, Summer Eternal is also launching as an art collective and seeking to re-engage with artists, designers, and others who previously worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em> as well as others. The group’s website lays out its manifesto, artistic vision, and studio setup which is a worker-owned co-op. It sounds like it’s still in the earliest stages of figuring out what its first RPG will be. </p><p> “I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking,” Tuulik wrote in a press release. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged — for five fucking years I’ve been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind — let’s do it fresh from the start, but this time let’s not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.” </p><p>It’s unclear how this will all shakeout. We likely won’t see finished games from many of these teams for at least a couple of years.
