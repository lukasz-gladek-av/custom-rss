<p>Are the starters in Pokémon Legends: Z-A shiny-locked? For those looking to fill out their shiny dex in the new entry, getting a quick start on your first companion would be a nice boon.</p>



<p>The jingle and animation that made its debut in Pokémon Legends: Arceus have returned to help players know for sure when a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shiny Pokémon</a> has appeared, but what about getting the shiny forms of Tepig, Totodile, and Chikorita?</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether or not starters are shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Your first version of Chikorita will never be shiny. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A can not be shiny. All three of the options to start the game are indeed shiny-locked.</strong></p>



<p>However, just because your initial Pokémon selection will not be able to be shiny, that doesn’t mean you’ll never have a chance to get those creatures in a shiny form. Much like in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, there will be opportunities to catch more Tepig, Totodile, and Chickorita out in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the usual breeding mechanic you would see in the main games isn’t in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, your only option for getting shiny starters is by catching them in the wild or by having a friend trade you their shiny that they caught in the wild, but good luck having that good of a friend.</p>



<p>In many ways, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-character-customization-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is a continuation of the features in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and not connected to the mainline games.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-legendaries-mythics-and-gift-pokemon-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a">Are Legendaries, Mythics, and Gift Pokémon Shiny-Locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A?</h2>



<p><strong>Like the starters, legendary, mythic, and gift Pokémon are also shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22967325315&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC1RXL2gbv06knnCyBaLlfQOyzPWM&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a6-J2Pf2xDLAF_SdagMvszXCw9WFdvgiF7BL1yhoYFq_PYwHG7xvWQaAh7sEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there are several special Pokémon that are encountered through the story and special requests. The legendaries of Pokémon X and Y in Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Mewtwo are all shiny-locked, as are the mythicals Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokémon that you receive as a gift, which include the original Kalos region starters Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie, will also never be shiny when received through the gifting method, but these Pokémon can also be found in the wild later in the game, similar to the current starters.</p>



<p>Completing the shiny dex in Pokémon Legends: Z-A requires many of the same methods that Arceus had before. The lack of breeding and the various shiny-locked situations will limit your chances somewhat, but you already know going in that shiny hunting is something that is going to take a lot of time regardless.</p>

                <p>2K Games hasn't said much about its free-to-play third-person shooter currently in the works under the working title Project Ethos, but the game is not being abandoned.</p><p>2K Games shared a memo from 2K President David Ismailer today in which the executive confirmed that it has hired Ben Brinkman to take over as studio head for developer 31st Union. The company's previous boss, former Call of Duty executive Michael Condrey, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">left the studio earlier this year.</a></p><p>Ismailer said in a memo to staff that the feedback from the Project Ethos test in Fall 2024 was "enlightening" for the studio. "It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity," Ismailer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Y6b7nk0ZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5Y6b7nk0ZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The executive said he believes the "renewed vision" for Project Ethos is one that is "poised to deliver on its promise to our players."</p><p>He went on: "Our confidence in Project Ethos grows every day."</p><p>Brinkman is a veteran of the shooter space, having most recently spent five years at Respawn as executive producer for Apex Legends. Before that, he was an executive producer for the Call of Duty series at Activision from 2008 to 2020. He's actually returning to 2K, as he was a producer at the company from July 2006 to March 2008.</p><p>GameSpot's hands-on preview of Project Ethos said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-ethos-is-delightfully-different-but-struggles-with-its-identity/1100-6527304/" data-ref-id="1100-6527304">"delightfully different" but lacked an identity.</a> Exactly what this "renewed vision" is remains to be seen, nor do we know when 2K may share more details about the game or show it off again.</p><p>In February, it was reported that Project Ethos would have to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">"pivot or be killed."</a></p><p>The hiring of Brinkman and "renewed vision" for Project Ethos comes just after EA announced that it was in the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-apologize-absolute-batman-i-wasn%E2%80%99t-familiar-with-your-game.1325782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When DC Comics announced its new <em>Absolute </em>run—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-new-batman-run-is-2025s-best-selling-comic-yet-2000660095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another alternate universe reboot</a>—I was one of its loudest detractors. Sure, <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-wonder-woman-thompson-sherman-2000504758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absolute Wonder Woman</a></em>’s design objectively goes hard, but my favorite hero, Batman, looked goofy as hell. That fat, illegible logo on his chest barely resembled a bat, and the only thing “absolute” about him was that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-batman-interview-scott-snyder-nick-dragotta-design-batsuit-axe-gotham-2000506366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce “beefcake” Wayne</a> was an absolute unit of a man. Since his first issue was released last year, I would scoff and clown on him to my friends whenever his visage graced my timeline. I didn’t want anything to do with the series…until I did.</p><p>As with most of the random things <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamen-rider-kuuga-tokusatsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wind up experiencing and writing about on Aftermath</a>, the inciting incident that led me to barrel to my local comic book shop and cop myself a volume of <em>Absolute Batman</em> was something small. In this case, it wasn’t the unintelligible Frank Miller-esque bat-logo I’ve mocked since day one, or the caped crusader’s Dorito-shaped natty build—it was his whip: the Batmobile. A vehicle more slab of metal than car, something that looked ripped straight out of <em>Mad Max</em> and dropped into Gotham. Seeing it out of context on Twitter a week ago made me ask: What the hell is Batman fighting to justify rolling around in that beast?</p><figure><figcaption>Let's not think about the Batmobile's carbon footprint. <span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>So I barreled to my local comic book shop, picked up the first volume of <em>Absolute Batman</em>, and got my answer. Gotham is more messed up than it’s ever been, and it needs a different type of Batman to save the day. A Batman who’s already shot up the leaderboard as one of my favorite iterations on the character.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.dc.com/comics/absolute-batman-2024/absolute-batman-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absolute Batman</a></em>, written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Nick Dragotta with colors by Frank Martin, strips Bruce Wayne of his usual hallmarks. No mansion. No generational wealth infinite money glitch. No philanthrocapitalist posturing. He’s arguably the most on-the-ground version of Bruce Wayne I’ve ever seen: a blue-collar collar engineer. Instead of one central hub that gets more comedic with every trophy he adds to his man cave, he sets up a network of safehouses in abandoned construction projects. He’s tapped in as Bruce Wayne, listening to the city’s pulse from the ground up and acting as a seismic earthquake, reshaping Gotham to the people’s needs. Meanwhile, Batman is bigger, scrappier, hungrier, and as tame as a rabid dog. Yet in that rough, visceral outline of his still-recognizable silhouette is a heart that feels more Batman than most Batman media I’ve experienced.</p><p><strong>Some light spoilers on that</strong></p><p>As someone who was there for DC’s New 52 reboot of the comic universe in high school and checked out ever since, <em>Absolute Batman</em> is the first iteration of the character that I’ve truly vibed with in years because it finally addressed a gripe that’s always kept me at arm's length: Batman never felt class-conscious. The whole conceit of Bruce Wayne being a nepo baby with infinite resources—a core tenet of his character—made it hard to buy into his crusade against injustice when he was, in many ways, its financial beneficiary as the head of Wayne Enterprises.</p><figure><figcaption><em>The Batman Strikes!</em> #39<span></span><span>Jai Nitz, Sanford Greene and Nathan Massengill / DC Comics</span></figcaption></figure><p>I even caught heat for saying as much on Tumblr years ago in a post that’s still garnering notes from all 50 people still using the site—when I wrote about how, for all his wild crossovers fighting Xenomorphs and the like, Batman never seemed concerned with systemic issues like wealth inequality plaguing Gotham, giving credence to streets literally called Crime Alley. Folks dug up receipts of Bruce Wayne doing philanthropic stunts, ironically enough, like hiring out Black Mask’s goons, helping them go straight. Still, they missed the point: it was always a performative flex to one-up villains, never a sustained commitment to real change. It was giving <a href="https://columbiachronicle.com/opinion/brandwagoning-black-lives-matter-movement-is-not-a-commodity-or-aesthetic-for-branding-purposes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black square and hashtag on Instagram activism</a> energy, and I never took the bait on that aspect of Batman’s brand of heroism.</p><p><em>Absolute Batman</em>, however, is about that action. This version of Bruce doesn’t posture; he dismantles. Like Pattinson’s Batman realizing fear can’t be all he symbolizes, he adopts radical heroism. What’s more, he manages to do so by inflicting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJQPFtTUqJY&amp;pp=ygUuYmF0bWFuIHYgc3VwZXJtYW4gYmF0bWFuIHdhcmVob3VzZSBmaWdodCBzY2VuZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snyderverse Batman levels of violence</a> that push the envelope even harder without feeling out of place, given how chaotic and unjust his world has been allowed to fester unchecked. I mean, look at his Joker. Absolute Batman’s gotta put Batboots to asses to save the day, no matter how torn from ass to appetite his foes are in the aftermath. He’s basically as close as Batman’s gonna get to being The Punisher. Yet, he’s not at all as cringeworthy as I assumed that premise would be, thanks to Snyder’s stellar writing, Dragotta’s kinetic art, and Martin’s moody coloring keeping him tethered to reality.</p><p>Seeing Black Mask—a villain I’ll forever be tilted about getting shafted for Joker in <em>Arkham Origins</em>—finally gets his spot as Batman’s starter villain in <em>Absolute Batman</em> felt like vindication. This version of Black Mask is more conniving, cyberpunk-coded, and disturbingly relevant to the type of 4Chan-incited anarchistic violence. He embodies all this by enacting a <em>Purge</em>-esque plan to weaponize Gotham’s distrust of local politicians by turning corruption into a bounty system where citizens can literally profit off of taking out the powerful. It’s a delicious counter to Batman’s vigilante ethos. I mean, Black Mask takes “eat the rich” to its most literal extreme.</p><figure><figcaption>I clapped when he did the <em>Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman</em> thing. <br><span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>And it’s not just Black Mask who gets a refreshing remix. Ripples of familiar Batman mythos—Riddler, Killer Croc, Penguin, Two-Face, and of course, Catwoman—are reimagined as Bruce’s childhood friends. In what I’ve gleaned of them, they’re not just rogues-to-be; they’re both reflections of how shared trauma as children of Gotham and decisions they'll make as adults will test their growing pains. For now, their interests are aligned, but the winds are already blowing in the direction of them becoming emotionally entangled adversaries when they inevitably clash. As an anime fan and lifelong <a href="https://x.com/Nyanlartothep/status/1977722660873273390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BatCat shipper</a>, I’m just ticked at this version of <a href="https://x.com/purpleselina/status/1977166720499666960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catwoman being Afro-Latina</a> with an aesthetic evoking <a href="https://durarara.fandom.com/wiki/Celty_Sturluson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celty Sturluson from <em>Durarara!!</em></a></p><p>Getting back to the man himself: Black Mask tests Batman’s mettle not just physically (which he surprisingly has hands enough to do), but ideologically. He even wafts money in Bruce’s face, tempting him to give up the whole crime-fighting schtick for millions of dollars. Bruce literally sets it on fire (in the shape of a bat), and while <em>Absolute Batman</em> still walks that razor-thin Batfleck-style line of not killing, the story thumbs the scales just enough to keep the cool factor from drowning out his non-lethal ethos. He still doesn’t kill, mind you—but he certainly leaves a lasting impression.</p><figure><figcaption>I understand it now. <span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>Also, that dumb logo I clowned on? Turns out it’s one of many utilitarian use cases for his whole beefy look. The bat logo on his chest is actually a slab of iron Bruce retrofits into an axe—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-batman-bat-logo-axe-dc-comics-2000497553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a literal hammer and sickle</a>. His war rig Batmobile is a convertible construction vehicle he uses to rebuild Gotham after every battle, complete with a wrecking ball that doubles as a weapon and an anchor to one of his many Batcaves beneath the riverbed. His long-ass ears? They’re concealed combat knives. Even his weird-ass cape is kitted out with a multi-tool of hooks, claw-thumbs, and retractable spikes. <em>Absolute Batman</em> is an embarrassment of edgelord design elements pushed to their absolute zenith. I’m not made of stone. That shit goes hard.</p><p>No image can further cement why I mess with <em>Absolute Batman</em> than artist (and fellow Chicagoan) <a href="https://x.com/danielwarrenart?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Warren Johnson</a>’s illustration of Batman choking out an ICE agent with his hamhock arms and fighting off the Ku Klux Klan. I used to joke online about half-expecting DC to never go there with Batman as a hero who’s about that action. And now it finally has with <em>Absolute Batman</em>, I’m all in.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/absolute-batman-dc-comics]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Ubisoft has released details about Anno 117: Pax Romana’s multiplayer modes, confirming that players can face off against each other, work together, and even play the game’s campaign together. Ubisoft has also stated mods will be usable in multiplayer, though those will require all players to have the same mods installed so they work.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana Preview – Pleasing Plebians &amp; Trading Triremes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xOhonMdJCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana’s PvP mode allows up to four players to face off against each other to grab the best locations, shore up alliances, and go to war. In co-op, players play as the same governor to share responsibilities and you will have to work together to keep things running smoothly, lest you want your faction to fall to outside forces. Third, you can mix PvP and co-op. You can have four teams of four, where each team is a governor, face off against each other. Multiplayer will be invite only so you will need to have people on your friends list if you want to play with them. Another new addition is co-op live save games, where players can continue co-op games by themselves and re-invite friends to join later. Anno 117: Pax Romana will also feature cross-play. When DLC is released, all players will need to own it if they want to use in multiplayer, there will be a day and night cycle, and the game .does not feature text or voice chat functionality.</p>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is due to be released on November 13th for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC.</p>

<p>Insider-Gaming has based its report on datamined files it obtained, which include references to two boat vehicles. Unless these boats have wheels, or the files refer to boat skins that'll go on a tank, it's a clear indication that naval warfare is in the works.</p>



<p>The two files in question, per Insider-Gaming, are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_JetSki</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_RHIB</li>
</ul>



<p>'Glacier,' if you didn't already know, is the codename for Battlefield 6. 'MP' should be pretty self-explanatory as multiplayer, and the rest is obvious.</p>



<p>With naval warfare already being heavily teased by EA and Battlefield Studios, if/when it does arrive in Battlefield 6, it'll be yet another point towards how this latest iteration of Battlefield is shaping itself more like what players loved in Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and getting away from what we saw in Battlefield 2042, which, most Battlefield players would probably agree, is not at all a bad thing.</p>

		<p>Chucklefish and co-developer Robotality have announced that the magical life simulator has been delayed into 2026, so it will not be released this year as planned. However, it is not all bad news as an interactive map for the game’s location Mossport. You can check out an image of it below, or click through to the official website to check out the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">interactive Witchbrook map</a>.</p>



<p>Every colourful area on the Witchbrook map is a playable area, with locations including Shadhollow Forest, Parasol Sands, Mossport High Street, the Student Village, Shadbrook Cottage and, of course, Witchbrook College. In a blog post, Chucklefish stated what would come next in the Witchbrook development journey saying, <em>“The extra time we’re letting the cauldron bubble has opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support we hadn’t initially planned! More details on this as soon as we can share them. We’re hoping this glimpse at the map conveys the scale and variety of places you’ll be exploring in Witchbrook, when it releases next year! We’ll be sharing more development updates this side of the year with a blog focused on character customisation arriving in the next few weeks. Also word on the street is that there’s another&nbsp;<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWBOracle">The Witchbrook Oracle</a> already in the works. We can’t wait to share more.”</em></p>
<p>Witchbrook is set to release for PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Archetype Entertainment has shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNkmV0gBClM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new EXODUS Founders Q&amp;A video</a>, which includes plenty new details about the game, and several new screenshots. Additionally, the game is now available for wishlisting on all major platforms: <a href="https://exodus.game/71y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/r3h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/3us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://exodus.game/rbn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>.</p>



<p>In the Founders Q&amp;A video, Studio Co-Founder &amp; General Manager Chad Robertson and Game Director Chris King answered several questions fielded by EXODUS fans. Regarding inspirations and influences, they admitted that Mass Effect was at the forefront for its deep narrative, branching choices, and continuity across sequels, but also mentioned Guerrilla's Horizon series for its elemental combat interactions and even Retro Studios' Metroid Prime when it comes to exploration, spatial puzzle solving, and the feeling of isolation.</p>



<p>When designing weaponry for the game, the studio employed the Swiss Army knife concept: Travelers don't have unlimited space for gear in their long voyages, so they must bring versatile multi-tools with them. For example, the so-called Recycler is both a salvage tool and a base gun. It can accept scavenged materials as ammo and transform for different purposes, giving players flexibility without managing many resources. </p>



<p>Archetype confirmed that stealth is a fully supported option in EXODUS. Players can stealth through encounters, go loud, or solve conflicts by talking. Ultimately, player agency was the studio's top priority, so multiple playstyles (including companions specialized for stealth and unique Aegis suits) are supported. In combat, players must observe, plan, and execute, but they must also often improvise as needed. Early game encounters will feature human factions and Celestial Constructs (robotic guardians of lost technology). After acquiring a spaceship, though, threats grow more complex and dangerous. For example, the 'Rot' is eventually introduced as a corrupting force for technology and the environment, not to mention a primary story antagonist affecting both enemies and planetary life.</p>



<p>As you would expect from a game inspired by Mass Effect, side quests were designed not to be filler missions. They deepen relationships with companions, offer skill upgrades, and enhance immersion in the universe of EXODUS. Protagonist Jun Aslan was created to be relatable, starting from modest origins and being initially unaware of their full potential. The studio aims for the player to see themselves in Jun. The protagonist's narrative progression will become more and more meaningful as their significance to humanity becomes clear.</p>

<p>At the heart of the story prepared by Archetype Entertainment there are powerful and mysterious Ancient Remnants artifacts. At first, Jun Aslan is driven to seek them to save their homeworld, but throughout the story, Jun will have to make difficult, morally complex decisions about their use. These moral choices are central and were written to be weighty, prompting reflection from the player's side.</p>



<p>It had been a while since we heard about EXODUS, following the debut of the first gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in December 2024</a>. However, the developers have promised more news and updates before the end of the year. We may see the game once again at The Game Awards: after all, <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was first unveiled there in 2023</a>. </p>

			<p>As individual games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-more-than-two-times-concurrent-players-on-steam-than-hades/">Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> break their own personal concurrent player count records on Steam, Valve's platform keeps breaking its own total concurrent player count records. In September 2024, Steam <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/">surpassed 38.4 million concurrent players</a>, breaking all previous records. Now, it's exceeded that record high by three million players, surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent players</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/steam-has-hit-a-new-all-time-record-with-over-41-million-ccus/">DSOGaming</a>, it seems that a mix of Battlefield 6 having a stellar launch between concurrent player counts on Steam and units sold, paired with the last Steam Next Fest event of the year kicking up, and chart-topping regulars like DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike staying consistent all helped push the PC gaming platform to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">41,666,455 concurrent players, per SteamDB</a> on October 12.</p>



<p>Since breaking the record, the player count hasn't gotten back to 40 million, but after first reaching 41 million players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/#1y">earlier this year in March</a>, it shows how Steam numbers are staying consistent, and with big releases like Battlefield 6, are pushing past previous records, even with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-global-games-market-consoles-lead-growth-nintendo-switch-2/">analysts pointing towards console games as leading the video game industry's growth</a> in the near future.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the year's big releases continue to push concurrent player counts on Steam, and in the case of Battlefield 6, see if Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is able to match, if not best, the shooter series' major comeback. For more on Battlefield 6 ahead of Black Ops 7's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-performance-benchmarks-wreck-havoc-break-stuff-with-solid-performance-on-all-gpus/">you can check out our benchmarking tests to ensure you're playing at the best settings for your setup</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When I hit play on EA’s new “deep dive” trailer for the upcoming <em>Plants vs Zombies Replanted,</em> I didn’t expect to be presented with a fake stream featuring two actors pretending to be hip and cool content creators playing the new remastered version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/plants-vs-zombies-viral-single-was-so-weird-people-th-1845453037">PopCap’s beloved tower defense game.</a> Yet that’s what this new trailer is. It’s so strange and cringey.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FTL_utrFfws">Announced earlier this year</a>, <em>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</em> is a <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-interview-popcap/">4K remastered version of the original 2009 <em>PvZ</em></a> with some new content as well as bonus features like the co-op mode first seen in the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Think of it as the ultimate version of the popular game, which will finally be available on consoles and PC later this month. I’m very excited to replay <em>PvZ</em> after not touching the game for many, many years. But a new trailer from EA showing off <em>PvZ Replanted</em> nearly made me question my excitement for this remastered classic.</p>

 <p>Released on October 14, EA’s “Deep Dive Trailer” does indeed show off a lot of the upcoming <em>PvZ Replanted</em>, including a new perma-death mode and the return of all the minigames found in past ports. That’s great. What’s not great is that all of this information is, for some reason, delivered to us via two fake streamers playing the game on a fake stream, complete with fake chat and forced reactions. Here’s the trailer:</p>

  <p>Yeah, it’s pretty bad. After watching it the first time, I felt like it must have been nearly 10 minutes long, but it’s not even 4 minutes. It just felt so much longer. I guess hearing a fake streamer yell out “Spud Yeah!” can make you lose track of time.</p>

 <p>The comments below the trailer are, predictably, not positive, with many excited about the game but unsure why EA decided to market it this way. The top-voted comment simply states: “‘How do you do fellow kids’ trailer.”</p>

 <p>Yeah, teens and kids aren’t stupid. They’ll see right through this obvious corporate-approved attempt to recreate a Twitch stream in the most sanitized way possible, say “Cringe,” and move on. <em>PvZ</em> is good. Just show people how much better this version looks and some of the new features. That’s all you gotta do to get people on board. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">The $20 price tag is also a great selling point</a> that this trailer fails to mention.</p> <p>Anyway, bad, cringey trailer aside, I’m still excited to play <em>Plants vs Zombies Replanted</em> when it arrives on consoles and PC on October 23.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love them or, more likely, hate them, Minecraft's Creepers are now an iconic part of Mojang's beloved sandbox game. But the explosive creatures probably wouldn't be included today, the developer has said, if it were to design them from scratch now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a new developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTJIYzJDJw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> discussing game balance and fairness, chief creative officer Jens Bergensten said that Mojang now followed a strong principle when adding any new item, biome or enemy to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> that could cause players grief. In a nutshell, if anything causes the player to suffer, it should be because players brought it on themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to avoid treating players in a way that feels unfair," Bergensten said. "So we have this guiding principle that bad things [can] happen, but they're technically the players' fault. What we mean by that is either the player caused it, or the player had a chance to prevent it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That means enemies have to feel fair — so players can choose to take them on if they want or have a decent chance of mitigating the danger if not. Situations that negatively impact a player should also never feel too random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bergensten listed various examples of things that have been added in the past that haven't felt as fair as intended — such as Iron Golems protecting villages by attacking Creepers (and getting said villages blown up), or Endermen randomly stealing blocks that could have some pivotal signifiance (such as a painstakingly-built Redstone circuits).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn't mean that Mojang won't add in tougher challenges, though the developer said it was now careful to make difficult content feel like something players were opting into — such as when actively making the choice to enter The End and take on the game's climactic Ender Dragon. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/the-biome-that-broke-minecraft-00-05-53-1760547479174.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mojang chief creative officer Jens Bergensten. Image credit: Mojang.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But how about the Creeper? It can be encountered from the very beginning of the game, it can instantly kill players and destroy builds, and it sometimes feels like it appears at random. So why does it still exist like it does?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even to this day, it's one of the monsters in gaming that I'm still a little bit afraid of," Bergensten admitted. "If you would follow the rules that we have today, we would probably not add the Creeper because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster just show up and destroy what you've built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Creeper is very iconic though," Bergensten concluded — which is true enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>In a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-563578">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> showcase, Gameloft has shared new info on the cozy game's upcoming Wishblossom Ranch expansion, which introduces a selection of new characters, biomes, and gameplay features when it launches on November 19. Oh, and there are a <em>lot</em> of horses.</p><p>Today's Disney Dreamlight Valley showcase gave players a glimpse at the story they can expect to experience in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, revealing that Cruella de Vil has taken control of the ranch and brought it to ruins with her villainy. At the same time, a giant flower beneath Wishblossom Ranch has been disturbed, causing wish magic to run rampant through the biomes. This expansion's tale will revolve around solving the mystery of the wish magic, as well as finding all of the missing horses that once inhabited the ranch and rebuilding it to its former glory.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxHY3r1_bY" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NBxHY3r1_bY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>Cruella de Vil isn't the only new villager coming in the expansion, though, as players will also get to befriend Tigger, Snow White, and Tinkerbell. They'll encounter these beloved Disney characters while exploring the expansion's new biome: the snow-covered Wishing Alps, Cruella-inspired Glamour Gulch, and oversized fauna-filled Pixie Acres. And as usual, each of these biomes features new critters to meet and feed, including geese, skunks, and adorable little bees.</span></p><p>Speaking of horses, Gameloft has confirmed that these majestic creatures will play a huge part in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, both in terms of story progression and as rideable mounts. In addition to working with and riding horses from Disney films--such as Tangled, Mulan, and Hercules--you'll even be able to customize horses with a wide variety of flairs to make them uniquely your own.</p><p>The horse-related elements aren't exclusively about customization and leisurely rides, though. Horses also bring new ways to work around the valley, as they allow you to run through Night Thorns, Splinters of Fate, Inkies, and brand-new Dead Wish Blossoms to clear them away. And your horse can even stomp the ground to dig holes, hold a watering can to water your crops, and kick mining nodes to help you collect gems.</p><p>The good news doesn't stop at having a helping hand (hoof?) around the valley, either. Unlike previous expansions, which were split into multiple parts that released over the course of a year, Wishblossom Ranch will release all of its content on day one. This means all four villagers and the full story will be available right away, incentivizing players to get to work rebuilding Wishblossom Ranch at their own pace.</p><p>For existing players, the standard version of the Wishblossom Ranch expansion will come with 5,000 moonstones--the game's premium currency--while the Deluxe Edition will come with 10,000 moonstones, the Arendellian Riding Outfit and Snowy Alpine House Style cosmetic items, and an exclusive Sven mount from the film Frozen. And yes, Sven is rideable!</p><p>Meanwhile, new players can purchase a Wishblossom Ranch Edition of Disney Dreamlight Valley that comes with the base game and the expansion, or opt for the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game, Wishblossom Ranch with all Deluxe Edition bonuses, and all previous expansions.</p><p>Lastly, anyone who purchases any version of Wishblossom Ranch between November 19 and December 3 will receive the Springtime Festival Outfit and Festival Tack cosmetic items for free.</p><p>Disney Dreamlight Valley's Wishblossom Ranch expansion launches November 19 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC. We've also learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-teases-cinderella-new-dreamteam-multiplayer-feature-and-2026-updates/1100-6535429/" data-ref-id="1100-6535429">Cinderella is coming to DDV</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a> has long been one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/" data-ref-id="2900-4900">best horror games</a> to play, but in its next update, it's going to get even scarier. Coming in a patch on October 21, Invasion mode is adding an optional PvP mode to the game for the first time, and the way developer Red Barrels has designed it adds a ton of horror and paranoia to the experience.</p><p>As devoted players already know, the normally PvE co-op horror game can be disrupted by "impostors," NPC characters who appear on the map as violent doppelgangers. These impostors are caught somewhat easily by their tell-tale laughs--they don't easily fool experienced players, though their behaviors have grown more sophisticated since the game first launched. But Invasion mode is about to overhaul that element in a major way.</p><p>During Invasion rounds, an enemy team of up to four players can join a game as impostors, taking turns infiltrating the round while disguised as players on the other team and armed with a kitchen knife. When waiting to spawn in, impostors can spy on the other team using security cameras, while those players can break the cameras as a counter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339" data-ratio="0.55786163522013" data-width="1590" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339"></a><figcaption>Invasion mode brings even more paranoia to a game that already loves toying with players' sense of safety.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png"></figure><p>It's the goal of the impostor team to sabotage the mission for the other side. Gone are the impostors' signature laughs that would give away the ruse, and impostors can even unlock a number of unique skills that will help them move faster, blend in better, and kill more efficiently. In the final moments of a round, all impostors are released onto the map, adding a final touch of chaos. In an added bit of fun, impostors can hear a moment of their victim's voice comms just before they kill them off, too.</p><p>I recently played a live preview of the mode and it was the scariest thing I've experienced in the game to date. At the same time, it was hilarious, in that "I'm so nervous, I'm laughing" sort of way. Each round of Invasion becomes fully enveloped in an air of paranoia. Even just working with another player on your team becomes an unnerving exercise. I didn't feel safe turning my back to my allies, because they may have been killers only wearing their face.</p><p>The mode looks like it'll be a hit for the horror game, and it comes alongside a bigger update that also adds an in-game shop, new missions, and the annual Halloween event, Geister. Twitch Drops are coming for the first time, too. All of these things come bundled in the October 21 game patch on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

                <p>Nearly two years ago, Rockstar Games shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, one of the most highly anticipated titles in the history of the video game industry. Since then, numerous analysts and gaming industry figures have speculated or openly wished for the game to be sold for $100 in order for other AAA games to reach the same price. Now, Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has shared his wish for GTA 6 to be $100 as well, but not for the same reason as some of his peers.</p><p>"They're the only ones that can get away with it," said Stockman during an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Esports Insider</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-deserves-100-saints-row-director-insists/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>). "I don't think it's a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that [there will] be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100. The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them."</p><p>Earlier this year, Wedbush Securities argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">selling GTA 6 at $100 could benefit players</a> by giving them a massive amount of in-game currency for GTA Online. Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliott disagreed and said it was a bad idea because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">GTA Online is the real cash cow</a> of the franchise. Elliott also cited the rising cost of living as a primary reason not to charge players a higher price than the industry standard. Most of the newer AAA games are now going for $70.</p><p>Take-Two was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-defends-nba-2k21s-price-increase/1100-6482168/" data-ref-id="1100-6482168">among the first publishers to raise its prices from $60 to $70 back in 2020</a>. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">non-committal about raising prices</a> again during an investor call in August.</p><p>"We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing," said Zelnick. "So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth, and we want to deliver more value than what we charge for it. We think we've generally speaking, gotten that right."</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

		<p>Just the endless recycling of fashion trends from 20-odd years ago, the PSP is having something of a spiritual resurgence in 2025. We always knew that Sony’s handheld was incredibly influential – fundamentally, its feature set was folded into every mobile phone on the planet – but a console can’t exist without iconic software to go with it.</p>
<p>We’ve recently seen Sony’s one-eyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">Patapon</a> return to screens (and their spiritual successors, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/ratatan-early-access-review-rhythm-action-warfare-is-the-best-kind-of-warfare/">Ratatan</a>), and now it’s the turn of blocks that drop. Lumines was one of the most important block-dropping games of its time, standing as a Sony exclusive take on a Tetris-style experience, and now, Enhance are returning to the series with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lumines-arise">Lumines Arise</a>, fresh from their masterful sojourn into spinning different-shaped blocks for Tetris Effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Exclusive Preview | PS5, Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilo5NSlpDfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lumines is a block-dropping game where timing and the passage of time are key to achieving a high score. The Timeline passes across the screen over and over again, and each time it does, it wipes, or collects all of the 2×2 blocks you’ve created by spinning and dropping the falling blocks into place. Doing this over and over again,will increase your combo, while also keeping you alive as the blocks start to stack up, and it becomes increasingly tricky to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>You can make those blocks bigger and bigger, combining 2×2 shape together, creating 3×3 blocks for an even bigger score, or chaining scores together by having them drop into place just as you clear other blocks. It’s beautifully simplistic, riffing on Tetris’ original block-dropping gameplay, and making it into something more modern and visually exciting.</p>


<p>So far, that’s all as true for the original Lumines as it is for Arise, but the team at Enhance have built on their work on Tetris Effect to maximise the audio-visual experience, while also making a few changes to the moment-to-moment gameplay. The newest addition is Burst. Entering Burst sees blocks of the opposite colour jumping to the top of the playing field, giving you further opportunity to grow a single huge Burst block, with the other coloured blocks continuing to leap out of the way as it grows. Not only will it earn you even more points, it’s a great last-ditch way to try and survive the impending doom of a full screen, adding an exciting extra wrinkle for players to iron out.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is all very Tetris Effect, which was, in turn, very much Tetris by way of Lumines. At this point, it’s practically block-dropping inception, but all you really need to know is that Enhance are masters of this genre and style, and Lumines Arise is the next step on that audio-visual pathway.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise responds to your gameplay with more feeling, more emphasis, than ever before. Blocks pulsate, breathe, or beat, while your controller throbs, rumbles and thumps in time. It makes you feel like you’re part of the musical track, rather than an observer, and for all that there are moments of frantic, abject terror at losing your streak and failing a level, this is an experiential game that needs to be played and taken part in, rather than simply spoken about.</p>

<p>Much like Tetris Effect, Lumines Arise looks spectacular. The visuals make this feel like a simple block-dropping game that’s come to life, that’s been inhabited by the very spirit of the music that accompanies it. Nothing is still; nothing is permanent, apart from your score and the frame of the gameboard. It’s a perfect juxtaposition of minimalism and maximalism, contained in one screen.</p>
<p>That would all be for nothing, if the soundtrack wasn’t good. Based on our early hands-on, this boasts the same mixture of progressive emotional dance music as Tetris Effect, and even if it’s not necessarily your genre, you can’t help but feel something while you’re playing. Soaring vocals, swelling soundscapes, all fit perfectly with the distinct thump of the drumbeat. It changes and evolves with every level and area, constantly shifting your attention, and the feel of the game, even while you’re performing the same fundamental task throughout.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how a shift in change, colour and tone can alter how the game feels. Circular pulsating shapes within the blocks feel completely different to the cold, harsh lines of straight-edged blocks, and they perform differently when they connect. One early level sees tiny astronauts appearing within the constructed block, floating off into space when the Timeline passes, and it’s hard not to be awe-struck and utterly put off at points. That will probably lessen with time, but, I have to say, I hope it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Pulling on that musical thread, once you’ve worked your way through Journey mode, you can take all of the tracks and create your own playlist. This is a perfect way to curate your own experience, and you can even watch the computer play while you just listen to the music by selecting Theater Mode.</p>

<p>There’s also multiplayer. Here you can compete side by side against other players, with Burst Mode coming in both ranked and custom flavours, while you can also fight your way to the top of the global leaderboards. This wasn’t active in our preview build, and I can’t wait to face off against some other players to see how I fare after years of playing Lumines. Probably not as well as I think I will.</p>
<p>Customisation comes in the form of your avatar, the Loomi. This diminutive floating fella is your in-game representative, and you can spend any Pon you earn while playing on customising them to make them truly unique amongst the other Loomi. It’s all random though, utilising the Loomi-Pon Rubiks-style cube to spit out a random cosmetic. If you want to get your avatar looking just right, you might have to play for a quite a while. Based on our hands-on, that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is the next evolutionary step in Enhance’s journey through audio-visual gaming. Once again, it builds on a framework that’s instantly comprehensible, but layers in an evocative set of visuals alongside some of the most compelling audio design you’ll find. Is Lumines Arise already essential? We won’t have long to find out, with the game set to release for PC and PS5, with PC VR and PSVR 2 support, on 11th November.</p>

<p>This one comes from JobJobLLC, the team behind the Zelda-inspired culinary venture '<a href="https://jobjobllc.com/collections/cookbooks/products/the-legends-cookbook-reprint">The Legend's Cookbook</a>', and '<a href="http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/">Brawl in the Family</a>' artist Matthew Taranto. It promises 35 recipes, all with a Paper Mario twist, and enough of the series' iconic art stylings that you'd assume it's been plucked from the backdrop of an unassuming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a> locale.</p>
<p>The book recently launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/437762268/paper-plates-a-fan-made-cookbook-inspired-by-paper-mario">Kickstarter</a>, where it hopes to raise $35,000 (around £26,000) by 15th November to make its dishy dreams a reality. It's already almost halfway there (and that's after just one day), with some pretty appealing Backer Rewards from a hardcover copy of the book to a denim overalls-esque apron — we're particularly fond of the idea of the latter.</p>
<p>While the adorable aesthetic was enough to draw us in, the recipes themselves look super appetising. Every dish has a pinch of Paper Mario to it too, so if the likes of Honey Shrooms or Checkerboard Cookies sound up your street, you're in luck.</p>

<p>Naturally, all of this is dependent on Paper Plates hitting its Kickstarter goal in the coming weeks, so be sure to keep an eye out for updates on its fundraising page if the mere idea has already got your mouth a-watering.</p>

Meant to capitalize on the Fall Guys trend, Sonic Rumble lets fans play as their favorite Sonic characters and duke it out with friends in speedy mini-games. Early tests went well, but the game saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few delays</a> this year and last. Now, it seems it has finally&nbsp;landed on a release window, as well as addressed some fan feedback.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-rumble-hits-mobile-devices-in-november-feedback-addressed">Sonic Rumble Hits Mobile Devices in November, Feedback Addressed</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000209/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/_FP6XoAMZYA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new trailer</a>, the team announced that Sonic Rumble will release in November. No exact date was given outside of the month. The game is expected to release on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store. In the trailer, we see all our favorite Sonic characters like Shadow and Cream, as well as a pack dedicated to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-3-is-the-second-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. We get a look at some of the game modes and the intense 32-player gameplay. The video also teased future costumes and members like Excalibur Sonic and Wave from Sonic Riders. </p>



<p>The team also took feedback from fans who joined Sonic Rumble’s early tests. As for what’s being changed, the progression and rewards system is being simplified and fine-tuned.

The game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/09/01/stardew-valley-publisher-teases-upcoming-39-stardew-valley-meets-harry-potter-39-game.aspx">first teased way back in 2017</a>, was slated to release this winter.</p><p>Witchbrook has been described as a mix of Stardew Valley and Harry Potter, placing players in the shoes of an aspiring witch/wizard who is a new resident in the magical city of Mossport, where they attend Witchbrook College. Here, players can form friendships, engage in romantic relationships, and interact with citizens who have fully fleshed-out daily schedules and lives. As a student at Witchbrook, you’ll attend classes, complete assignments, and sharpen your spellcasting and potion-making skills to become top of your class.</p><p>Outside of classes, you can freely explore Mossport to engage in activities such as starting a business, renovating your home, and more leisurely excursions. As the school year progresses, Mossport and its residents change throughout the seasons. Witchbrook can also be played with others in four-player online co-op.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Witchbrook is an ambitious game, and developer Chucklefish <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">posted a developer update</a> stating that, despite making good progress en route to launching this year, the team realized it needs more time to ensure Witchbrook lives up to its years-long hype.</p><p>“Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive,” reads Chucklefish’s statement.</p><p>The developer update also revealed the game’s world map. Chucklefish also says a silver lining of the delay is that it allows them to explore the possibility of bringing Witchbrook to more platforms. The game is currently slated to launch on Xbox, PC, and was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/the-magically-cozy-life-sim-witchbrook-comes-to-switch-this-holiday">recently confirmed for Switch</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the">Switch 2</a>. The team is also looking to add additional language support and promises more developer updates in the future, including a blog post focused on character customization.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/wizarding-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-net-workers-unionize-as-microsoft-neutrality-agreement-expires.1325653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers on Blizzard’s Battle.net platform have voted to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. The nearly 400 workers under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department have created two new unions: one for software engineers, product and project managers, designers, and others; and a second for localization, quality assurance, and customer support.</p><p>The unit made up of Battle.net's tech workers has roughly 300 members, and the localization, QA, and customer support unit has around 80 members. The decision to split the unit into two instead of a single union was "mutually agreed" to by both Microsoft and CWA, according to a CWA spokesperson.</p><p>Microsoft has recognized the units after workers voted by signing union authorization cards and voting through an online portal. The Platform and Technology workers squeezed in their vote ahead of the expiration of <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft and CWA's neutrality agreement</a> this week, which was signed in 2022 when Microsoft was looking to finalize its $68.7 billion <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>. The neutrality agreement gave game workers at the company a more streamlined process for unionizing and meant that the voting units under Microsoft did not have to go through the National Labor Relations Board's process, making things quicker.</p><p>Unions existed under Activision Blizzard before the neutrality agreement, like at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/02/wow-diablo-blizzard-albany-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Albany</a>, but a bunch more have formed since its signing. The teams that work on <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Diablo</em></a>, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story and franchise development</a>, and <a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/austin-workers-unionize-at-game-studio-blizzard-13286381/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quality assurance</a> all unionized into separate units. The neutrality agreement did not mean Microsoft or Activision Blizzard <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported</a> unions, but that they didn’t interfere in their formation. It's not immediately clear how unionization efforts will fare without such an agreement, or if a new agreement will be signed.</p><p>Daniel Weltz, a principal software engineer who's worked at Blizzard for almost 20 years, told Aftermath that seeing the <em>World of Warcraft</em> team unionize was a turning point for him. "Even just the fact that <em>World of Warcraft </em>organized first, the biggest and most profitable team, gave a big push that made us think, 'we could do this too,'" he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Platform and Technology department unions had the support of the other Microsoft and Activision Blizzard unions behind them, too. Blizzard senior software engineer Chris Myles, who's been at the company for 18 years, said several of the organizing committees across the company met to "compare notes" and "share what worked and what didn't." He continued, "We also had an organizing committee summit to get together to discuss where we are and where we’re going."</p><p>From here, the Platform and Technology unions will negotiate with Microsoft and Activision Blizzard on their first contracts. Just two unions under Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have completed negotiations: <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a>, which announced its QA union in 2022, ratified a contract in August, while ZeniMax Media QA workers, who unionized in 2023, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a tentative contract agreement in May</a>. Both had been in negotiations for years.</p><p>Alex Kohn, a senior data scientist at Blizzard Entertainment, said he's looking to negotiate for "policies regarding layoffs and [return-to-office.]" Myles added that watching his long term colleagues get pushed out of Blizzard because of <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return-to-office policies</a> is what moved him to get involved in the union. He said that "more equitable treatment of QA and [customer service]" is a priority, too. "The industry always treats the majority of QA and CS like they’re a separate entity, when in fact, we work very closely with them and we can’t really do our jobs without them," he said.</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p><p>"We’re past having to wonder what happens if we don’t succeed," Myles said. "I got that question from multiple people—what happens if we don’t get the results that we want? Do we take another swing at it or do we give up? We don’t have to confront those questions anymore."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="f637b568ebc0f"><a title="ROG Xbox Ally X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f637b568ebc0f/rog-xbox-ally-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft/ASUS</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of its release on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> (yes, tomorrow), the ROG Xbox Ally X has received a whole bunch of reviews, and it sounds like this thing might be the new king of PC handhelds.</p>
<p>Heck, at <strong>£799 / $999</strong>, you'd hope so, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>We're going to highlight the review over at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/rog-xbox-ally-x-an-amazing-handheld-pc-with-plenty-of-console-like-potential">Pure Xbox</a> first and foremost, with the team calling the Ally X a "superb PC handheld with outstanding ergonomics, terrific cooling and natural-feeling controls for Xbox fans". Criticisms include the lack of an OLED screen (welcome to the club), a few software frustrations, and the lack of a trackpad for mouse controls.</p>
<p>All in all though, with a score of 9/10, it sounds pretty great.</p>

<p>The folks over at IGN were similarly positive with another <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">9/10 review</a>, going so far as to call the Ally X a potential "device for the history books", providing it receives a few software updates.</p>
<p>So it sounds like the Ally X is the PC handheld to beat right now, eclipsing the Steam Deck in raw power, but also commanding a hefty price tag to boot. The standard Xbox Ally is a bit cheaper at <strong>£499 / $599</strong>, but even this is a big ask these days.</p>
<p>It makes the Switch 2 look like somewhat of a bargain by comparison, priced at <strong>£395.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>£449.99</strong> in the US. Yes, it's not as powerful, but you're getting a true console experience with the Switch 2, not to mention the plethora of incredible first-party games that simply won't be available elsewhere.</p>
<p>We do like the Ally X though, and who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting one at some point down the line. Right now, however, the price is just a little bit steep for us, and it's clear that this thing has a very specific target audience in mind.</p>
