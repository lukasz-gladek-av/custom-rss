<p>Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings. Each month we‚Äôll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month‚Äôs subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Let's cut to the chase, shall we? We've reached our Halloween quota for the month already, so rest assured you'll find no spook and/or spoop below...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - October 2025</h2>

<h3>"strong reasons" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Saving for a Switch 2, but the release of the Galaxy bundle, I realized. Why do I want a Switch 2 now? I'm still in Pharloom, just defeated the Last Judge and entered the Citadel. I'm still eager to return to Hallownest afterwards. I played, and loved, the Galaxy from 3D All Stars, and always wanted to go for Galaxy 2, but it wasn't available. Hundreds of hours still wait for me, and the Switch 2 has yet to give strong reasons to give hundreds for it. Mario Kart World is cool, but not enough to replace 8. Bananza can't carry a system by itself like BotW did. Right now, considering price price and gaming options, the first Switch is still the better choice.<br>
<strong>Rui Pedro</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could retire now, do nothing but play games eight hours a day, and still never get through my Switch backlog. Software library-wise, it beats even the mighty 3DS as it nears the end of its cycle.</p>
<p>If you're not desperate for the upgrades and speedier menus (which <em>are</em> hard to go back from), and you can live without Bananza and co. for the time being, I'd absolutely sit tight and enjoy the system you've got. It's a winner. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"two pack"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,<br>
With the release of Super Mario Galaxy 1+2, do you think that Nintendo will pursue other ‚Äútwo pack‚Äù games in the future? I‚Äôm thinking specifically of the very often rumored Zelda: Wind Waker/Twilight Princess and Metroid Prime 2 &amp; 3 Switch ports. I am specifically curious to see what forms MP2 and MP3 could arrive in, if at all. MP2 was a GameCube title, so it could be on the Expansion Pack for the Online service. But what about MP3, which was a Wii title? If Nintendo were to remaster/remake it for Switch/S2, couldn‚Äôt they just do the same for MP2 and repeat the Galaxy strategy?<br>
If these games are to be released, what form do you think we‚Äôll see them in and why?<br>
Thanks,<strong><br>
An Anonymous Nintendo Fan</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wind Waker and TP would be standalones, I'd say. For Prime 2 and 3, as straight sequels, I'm imagining a hypothetical 'Metroid Prime Trilogy Remastered' physical three-pack, rather than a standalone Prime 2+3 package.</p>
<p><em>Sure</em>, you've already got Prime 1 on the shelf, but as Nintendo (probably) says, "You'll buy the same game again as part of a $70 package and you'll like it!" <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="b572eb37d6f5b"><a title="Metroid Prime Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b572eb37d6f5b/metroid-prime-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"not true"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendolife<br>
I wonder if Nintendolife have ever reviewed or made more articles about the games by Outright Games.<br>
I have found certain games by them in articles but unfortunately only very very few games by them get highlighted on Nintendolife. I have to create my thread about Outright Games and keep posting new trailers to update the information.<br>
Also, I keep hearing the negativity from other users who prejudge the games as cash grabber games.<br>
That's not true. Kids franchise games can be as great as other games, it's depend on the developer who made them. And not everyone has interest in AAA games. I'm sure there is always the audience who has interest, not only me.<br>
I hope the Nintendolife staff can give more credits to the games by Outright Games. Even adults like me can be interested in kids franchise like Paw Patrol, Bluey, Barbie, Gabby's Dollhouse, etc.<br>
<strong>From: Anti-Matter</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews?title=company%3Aoutright_games">we've reviewed 14 Outright-published games</a> (including Bluey) throughout the Switch generation, and we've touched on plenty more with news articles. We try to cover a wide range of games that will interest readers of all ages and tastes, but personal interest is definitely a factor in our selections. Which, for instance, accounts for our increased Star Trek-related coverage in recent years - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/star-trek-prodigy-supernova">one of which was from Outright Games, in fact</a>.</p>
<p>We'll continue to do our best to cover as broad a spectrum of software as possible. There's just so much out there that, unfortunately, some things have to fall by the wayside. Shining a light on games that don't have the brand power of a Gabby's Dollhouse or Paw Patrol is something we factor in, as well. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"keep things reasonable"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve been running a video game club for about two years now. Think of it like a book club, but with games‚Äîsomeone picks one, we all play it, and then meet once a month to talk about it. The tricky part is cost. I try to keep things reasonable by setting a $20 limit, but it still means asking people to buy games they might not end up liking. I really wish there were a library or rental service for games. Do you know of anything like that? Or any tips for sharing a game across 6‚Äì8 people?<br>
<strong><em>Alexander Zaitzeff</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting eight copies might be an issue, but despite the odds, public libraries do still exist in some places and they're a real untapped resource. Last year, I was amazed to see the selection of PS4 and Switch games at my local, so definitely investigate and support your libraries, if you've got them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd say $20 is a fairly high limit considering how frequent and full eShop sales are. You could probably cut that in half, which should make a dud easier to live with. A quick look at my 'On Offer' wishlist shows Time Flies for 11,19‚Ç¨, Lego Bricktales for 4,49‚Ç¨, Kentucky Route Zero for 9,19‚Ç¨, Blazing Chrome for 4,24‚Ç¨...</p>
<p>Obviously, it's more challenging if you're nominating tentpole first-party titles, but I'd try tailoring your shortlist around discounted games. There's bound to be something, large or small, in the '2,382 games on sale' that'll appeal to whoever's picking this month. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"exploring open areas"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Nintendo Life!<br>
How excited are all of us for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? I can't wait to get my hands on it! After the latest Nintendo Direct trailer, I'm curious if the Bike will have it's own set of upgrades/power-ups to find? I think it would be cool to unlock different methods of traversal like hovering over water or anti-gravity tracks to drive up necessary walls. Could make for unique combat situations too! I guess it just depends on how much time we'll be exploring open areas like the desert we saw!<br>
You can omit this part if he can't answer but I have to ask: How is Zion's first playthrough of Metroid Prime Remastered going? Hope he's loving it!<br>
Thanks for reading!<strong><br>
MTMike87</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to Prime, I'm not the man to ask. So, let's check in with Team NL, starting with Ollie 'Roid-Boy Reynolds. How excited are we? - <em>Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>ü´≤-------------ü§ì-------------ü´± - <em>Ollie</em></li>
<li>"Not as excited as Ollie." - <em>Alana</em></li>
<li>"Wait, they‚Äôre doing a <em>fourth</em> Metroid Prime?" <em>- Jim</em></li>
<li>"Go away, I'm on holiday." - <em>PJ</em></li>
<li><em>*sleeping in Australia* - Liam</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As for Zion, he disembarked the good ship NL <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/youtube.com/watch?v=kI4hKbp64UI&amp;pp=0gcJCfwJAYcqIYzv">a couple of weeks ago now</a>. Let me Whatsapp him‚Ä¶<sub>.</sub> <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mike! Thank you for asking, I actually rolled credits on Metroid Prime Remastered a few weeks ago! I really enjoyed the exploration, the music, and the overall discovery. I had a lot of trouble with the platforming and finding the Artifacts towards the end there, but overall I‚Äôm really happy to have finally checked this box! I‚Äôve heard Prime 2 and 3 are a bit more straightforward too, so I‚Äôm looking forward to giving them a go. I still enjoyed games like Dread and Zero Mission more, but they‚Äôre seriously so exceptional at what they do. I also need to be ready for Prime 4! The little I played with mouse mode on Switch 2 has me excited to go through the game with that too! - <em>Zion</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>"time to game"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, college started for me. This is my first time in college, and I find amongst all the classes and homework and stress I haven't had much time to game. I barely managed to squeeze Silksong into the beginning of the semester, and now that things are really ramping up, I don't know how much free time I'll have in general. Any suggestions on games to play to maximize my gaming time? Also Animal Crossing and once-a-day games like it don't count. They're just not really my thing.<strong><br>
Kirbyo</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So you're looking for quick-to-start games that don't waste your limited time? Depends on whether you're after short and sweet, complete narrative experiences, or you're happy to jump in for a satisfying run or two in a game where story takes a backseat.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-short-games">Best Short Games</a> list does what it says on the tin, but otherwise I'd consider getting cosy with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-roguelikes-roguelites-and-run-based-games">a quality roguelike</a>. Whether you've got 10 minutes or 10 hours, things like Rogue Legacy or Vampire Survivors are always a great time. You might never play anything else, is the only problem. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"not a website"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendo Life,<br>
As a long time reader, I have always viewed Nintendo Life as not a website, but more of a modern day version of the old print magazines of the 1990's, like; Nintendo Power, GamePro, Electronic Gaming Monthly. Under this context, have you thought about bringing some of that nostalgic back to your "mailbox" and commissioning an artist to create a comic strip each month worthy of "Howard &amp; Nester" from Nintendo Power?<br>
Sincerely,<strong><br>
Luigi Mario</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this idea, although commissioning a comic strip would stretch the budget and I'd rather spend that elsewhere.</p>
<p>But hey, if readers want to send pics of their letter art, I'm more than happy to include it. Family-friendly, obviously. As a 30-ish-year internet denizen, I've seen more than enough material depicting Sonic and friends getting along famously, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Here's my Sonic from memory:</p>
<figure data-uuid="ab7c96af6768c"><a title="Sonic doodle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab7c96af6768c/sonic-doodle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yep. Still got it. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"A word of advice to all: Nintendo Customer Support does not like people recommending game ideas <i title=":worried:"></i>" - <strong>XXharmless_yigaXx</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least it's the right company. I get furious correspondence saying I'm greedy for charging $80 for Mario Kart. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Have you ever thought of showing the totals for an entire year of the What are you Playing this Weekend survey? I think it would be neat to see." - <strong>YarrCaptainJuan</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't ever thought of that. Maybe we'll look into it. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"If Nintendo asked you to choose a single game for their next Switch 2 Edition, which would you pick?</em></p>
<p><em>For me it‚Äôs Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Awesome game that looks quite bad on Switch 2, and the devs could take the opportunity to learn more about the hardware prior to Xenoblade 4." - <strong>RenanKJ</strong></em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Mario Maker, maybe? At this point, I'm intrigued to see just how stupid and convoluted Nintendo can make the titles, so put me down for 'Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition'. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for reading my long letter! Feel free to edit / cut my rambling. - <strong>JJtheTexan</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Donezo. (Jokes aside, thank you for the letter, JJ!) <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"That's a supergiant win with a team cherry on top.<br>
" - <strong>YoshiTails</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An outright winner. Am I doing this right? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>They could have introduced Yoshi and the Koopalings... - <strong>Mario Fan</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in a 'date' scenario? Now there's a thought to leave on. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="ca2ae8b823f34"><a title="Koopalings" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca2ae8b823f34/koopalings.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Hey. We saw you from across the room and we really dig your vibe...</em> ‚Äî <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom ‚Äî you're done!</li>

(I go to a lot of concerts and not having Dice, AXS, or Ticketmaster on my phone is kind of a deal-breaker.) I try to keep my homescreen focused on ‚Äúproductive‚Äù apps. Nothing that will encourage doomscrolling.</p><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/"><strong>Obsidian</strong></a> is there for purely reference purposes (recipes, combination lock codes I can never remember, etc.). While the desktop app is incredible, the mobile interface is slow and kind of terrible. For actual note-taking on the go, I much prefer a Field Notes pocket notebook and a pen. I use <a href="https://readwise.io/read"><strong>Readwise‚Äôs Reader</strong></a> because it autogenerates time-synced transcripts for YouTube videos and because of its integration with Obsidian, which makes collecting research and taking notes much easier, even though I kind of hate its UI.</p><p><em>I also asked Terrence to share a few things he‚Äôs into right now.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-mini-pcs-apple-quietly-clears-stock-of-the-latest-mac-mini-at-a-new-record-low-2000636927</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-mini-pcs-apple-quietly-clears-stock-of-the-latest-mac-mini-at-a-new-record-low.1328863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple has a reputation for keeping prices locked at full retail, especially on their latest releases. The company never discounts anything directly which makes finding deals on new Apple hardware feel like spotting a unicorn. That‚Äôs why the current situation with the 2024 Mac Mini is worth your attention: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">just dropped the latest 256GB M4 model to $499, down from $599</a>, and this is the lowest price we‚Äôve seen on Apple‚Äôs newest compact desktop. For this level of performance in such a compact package, there‚Äôs really no point looking at Windows alternatives right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance That Matters</h2>
<p>The M4 chip in this <strong>Mac Mini features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU</strong> which means serious computation from an object that‚Äôs hardly larger than a coaster. Apple‚Äôs chip design means these cores operate differently than standard Intel or AMD processors. The CPU is divided between performance and efficiency cores and uses heavy tasks such as video or 3D rendering on the performance cores and background tasks on efficiency cores without draining power and heat.</p>



<p>The total 16GB of RAM comes into play here as Apple‚Äôs architecture divides RAM between the GPU and the CPU instead of having independent ones like in the ancient machines. The <strong>system dynamically allocates memory</strong> depending on what you‚Äôre doing in this integrated manner so 16GB is more than enough compared to the same in the case of Windows. You can trim 4K video, have several creative programs open at once, or seriously multitask without the system bogging down. The <strong>256GB SSD offers speedy storage</strong> that‚Äôs light years ahead of the hard drives still found in value PCs.</p>
<p>This Mac Mini <strong>coexists nicely with Apple‚Äôs ecosystem</strong> in ways Windows mini PCs don‚Äôt: The Continuity features allow you to begin writing on your iPad or iPhone and resume where you stopped on the Mac Mini. AirDrop shares files from one device to another in an instant and hassle-free process. You can use your iPhone as a webcam for FaceTime, reply to messages directly from your desktop or even use your Apple Watch to control your Mac by unlocking it.</p>



<p>Wired Gigabit Ethernet is the standard with you getting to enjoy wired network speeds that blow WiFi for massive file transfers or streaming video. WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless connectivity is also available on the Mac Mini. Port alternatives are also ample with various <strong>Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports</strong> providing up to 40Gbps data transmission speeds, up to 6K resolution support for external displays, and speedy charging of devices. <strong>Two USB-A ports</strong> are included for legacy peripherals, and the headphone port is capable of driving high-impedance headphones to provide high-quality audio without an attached DAC.</p>
<p>Its small size allows it to <strong>vanish on a desk or be screwed behind a monitor</strong> with a VESA adapter. It is only 7.7 inches by 7.7 inches and 2 inches in height, occupying less space than most external hard drives. The <strong>fanless design makes it silent to operate</strong> which is ideal for recording studios, bedrooms, or offices where fan noise becomes irritating.</p>
<p>Priced at $499, this Mac Mini offers performance that would run much higher in a run-of-the-mill desktop or mini PC of this size. If you‚Äôve been waiting for Apple to budge on pricing, this is as good as it gets.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s taking you out to Nell's Diner on 11th November.</p>
<p>Announced this weekend during Phasmophobia's fifth anniversary panel at TwitchCon, the retro diner will be the ghost bustin' game's fourteenth map, promising "surprises" for all those who dare stop by there when it launches next month.</p>

<p>The team said it recognised that Phasmophobia's smaller maps tend to be more popular, as they allow for "quicker but intense investigations full of memorable moments", and Nell's Diner will accommodate that, complete with a classic food counter, iconic red leather stools and booths, a kitchen, storage rooms, and "plenty of hauntings to decipher". According to the developer, Nell's Diner will be a tad larger than Tanglewood Drive.</p><p>As the team at Kinetic Games has grown over the last five years and now creates all its own art assets, don't forget that we can also expect some environmental story telling with this map when it goes live, too.</p>
<p>"So far, we've added some really classic horror locations to Phasmophobia - an abandoned asylum, creepy farmhouses, and our more linear lighthouse map, Point Hope. We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life," said Dan "Dknighter" Knight, director of Kinetic Games and lead developer of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"Alongside the farmhouse reworks from this year, Nell's is an example of how we want all the maps in Phasmophobia to feel going forward. It's unique, and has been meticulously designed to tell more of a story to our players - beyond the immediate ghost they're hunting. We can't wait for everyone to get their hands on it next month."</p>
<p>Bertie recently chatted with creator Knight about Phasmophobia, where he was told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">how The Witcher 3 inadvertently saved the ghost-hunting game</a>. He also got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-will-begin-seeding-lore-to-build-story-for-the-film">a few more details on the recently announced film</a>, and how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-years-phasmophobia-overhaul-will-be-so-significant-it-will-feel-like-playing-a-new-game">next year's Phasmophobia overhaul will be so significant it will feel "like playing a new game"</a>.</p>

            <p>Streamer Emiru has disputed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s claim that it "responded to the incident" when she was assaulted during her TwitchCon Meet &amp; Greet, calling the claim "a blatant lie".</p>
<p>In a swift media statement, Twitch said "the safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority", and called the behaviour of the man who pushed past the queue to grab Emiru and kiss her "completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting". It then revealed it had "blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events".</p>

<p>"Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at TwitchCon and even in front of another creator's meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn't able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!" she wrote.</p>
<p>"I'm obviously shaken up by what happened and it's not the first time I've dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact."</p>
<p>She adds that "there were at least three or four" TwitchCon security staff "in the area" who "did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don't even appear in the frame".</p>
<p>"None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay," she adds.</p>

<p>Twitch's own statement reads: "The safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority. The behaviour displayed by the individual involved in the incident yesterday involving a high profile streamer was completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting.</p>
<p>"In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident. We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events. We are coordinating with the impacted creator‚Äôs team and, per our standard protocols, continue to cooperate with any law enforcement investigations.</p><p>"We have increased security at the Meet &amp; Greet attendee check-in point and will have additional security personnel surrounding participating streamers. If you‚Äôve RSVPed for a Meet &amp; Greet, please note that we are unable to accommodate +1s for the remainder of the event," it concluded. "Twitch has zero tolerance for harassment or acts that inhibit the safety and security of our community."</p>
<p>Twitch has not commented specifically on Emiru's claims, and the above statement has been slapped with a community note on Twitter/X claiming "Twitch allowed the assailant to walk originally and was only pressed to apprehend him until Emiru's manager pushed for it".</p>

<p>It was the NSO newbie <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a> that got put under the microscope <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-fatal-fury-special-snes">last time</a>, as we matched up two covers for this SNES brawler. Overall, it was a pretty one-sided fight. The colourful Japanese variant walked away with 68% of the vote, leaving the North American design with 32%.</p>
<p>This week, with Pok√©mon fever in the air, we're taking a look at the series' oft-forgotten spin-off, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hey_you_pikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a>. You remember this one, right? It's the N64 game with the microphone where you develop a close bond with Pikachu by repeatedly shouting rudimentary commands into the little yellow plastic sphere. Okay, it rarely worked, and it's hardly a classic, but it's got some regional variety in its box art.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftzphkx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The game was never released in Europe, so we just have two covers to choose between this week. Let's check 'em out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:163800 @ 1760874271 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0b0c9064383d9"><a title="Hey You, Pikachu! - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b0c9064383d9/hey-you-pikachu-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/243-hey-you-pikachu">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American cover is pretty unremarkable. Pikachu takes centre stage, naturally, with a coastal setting stretching out in the background. So why, oh why, can't we take our eyes off of Pika's weirdly detailed little fingers? Are those... knuckles? Don't tell us they're fingernails... Oh god, we can't look away.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6b17408be9abb"><a title="Hey You, Pikachu! - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b17408be9abb/hey-you-pikachu-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/243-hey-you-pikachu">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those horrific, tiny fingers make a return in the Japanese box art, but they're here posed into a cute little 'peace' sign, so we're slightly less distracted by them. The coastal background is replaced by rolling hills, and the vertical formatting means we can see more of Pikachu's frame. Hey, we're just grateful this didn't produce hyper-realistic toes.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-hey-you-pikachu]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a brief Instagram reel <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=ZnZzeTczcXQ5bHI5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted by Wired Japan</a> (and <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1978569051963310419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Culture Crave</a>) following a visit to Kojima Productions in Tokyo, Hideo Kojima shared his thoughts on how to use AI during game creation. The renowned game designer behind the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series believes artificial intelligence to be a 'friend' which will help him remain 'one step ahead' in the future.</p>



<p><em>A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas, but I think of AI as more of a friend. Since I've been in the digital industry, I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency. I would like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI.</em></p>



<p>Hideo Kojima's stance appears to forego an ideological position, whether in favor or against AI, and adopt a pragmatic mindset. Indeed, lowering costs and cutting down on time are two of the most significant problems that the games industry is facing since both development costs and timeframes are constantly on the rise. Mindful usage of AI technologies without negatively impacting human jobs may be the only way to solve or at least mitigate the issue.</p>



<p>Kojima has, after all, always been at the forefront of exploring new boundaries with technology, and continues to do so. Last month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-partnering-to-push-the-boundaries-of-storytelling-with-a-new-ar-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an unexpected partnership with Niantic Spatial to create a Death Stranding-inspired Augmented Reality experience. Following the June launch of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for PlayStation 5, Hideo Kojima and his team are now <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainly focused</a> on OD, a horror game in development for Xbox Game Studios, while Physint, the new action espionage game in development with PlayStation Studios, is further away on the horizon. Then there are also the big screen adaptations of the Death Stranding IP: a live action film and an animated film.</p>

<p>Sega celebrated the 'Year of Shadow' in 2024</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="75bcb26d6fd1f"><a title="Shadow the Hedgehog" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75bcb26d6fd1f/shadow-the-hedgehog.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Sega ran a year-long campaign for Shadow the Hedgehog that lined up with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> and the introduction of the "Ultimate Lifeform" in the live-action Sonic movies.</p>
<p>This was generally well-received by Sonic fans, and it's now led to some discussion about how Sega could potentially recreate this magic with <em>other</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> characters in the future. Speaking in a <a href="https://youtu.be/IGVWVq8cJPI">recent interview</a>, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka said he would like to continue this trend by spotlighting a different character. Characters in the next movie will apparently play an active role in this.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nhtmup&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Takashi Iizuka:</strong> ‚ÄúLast year, we promoted The Year of Shadow, influenced by the movie, but I‚Äôd like to choose a theme each year and spotlight different characters. I think we can predict which characters will appear in the upcoming movie, so I‚Äôd like those characters to play an active role.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As any Sonic fan would know, Sega has a huge cast of characters it can call on. The most recent game release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> features characters from multiple generations of Sonic. Apart from the main cast, this includes characters like Espio, Zavok, and even Sonic's Werehog form.</p>
<p>In terms of the live-action movies, the post-credit scenes in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 have already put the spotlight on a few classic characters, seemingly setting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/seemingly%20setting%20up%20the%20fourth%20major">the fourth major outing</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/emiru-releases-damning-statement-after-twitch-assault-%E2%80%98this-is-definitely-my-last-twitchcon%E2%80%99.1328815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, videos surfaced showing a harrowing assault on Emiru at TwitchCon in San Diego this weekend. While participating in a meet-and-greet with fans, the prolific creator was approached by a man who forcefully embraced her, attempting to kiss her in front of a crowd that included security staff.</p>



<p>It was an event that has been lambasted by attendees and viewers, with Twitch‚Äôs management and security of the event coming under fire from numerous angles. In response to the event, Emiru, a cosplay and League of Legends streamer with two million followers, posted a lengthy statement berating Twitch and how the firm handled the assault.</p>



<h2 id="h-that-is-a-blatant-lie-emiru-says">‚ÄòThat is a Blatant Lie‚Äô, Emiru Says</h2>



<p>Emiru was attacked by a man at TwitchCon, and while the Twitch leadership and social teams stressed the incident was handled professionally, Emiru had other things to declare that directly conflict with those claims.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs the <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full statement from Emiru</a> following the TwitchCon assault:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn‚Äôt able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!</p>



<p>I‚Äôm obviously shaken up by what happened and it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact. </p>



<p>Like I said, I don‚Äôt understand how he was allowed to make it to me in the first place. The security in the clip who reacts is my own security (it‚Äôs true my favorite and usual security guard was banned for holding a stalkers arm to bring him to police, at a past Twitchcon)</p>



<p>However, there were at least 3 or 4 other TwitchCon security staff in the area who did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don‚Äôt even appear in the frame LOL </p>



<p>The woman who is walking me away is my own personal manager, and behind the booth, the only two people who were checking on me and comforting me were her and my friend. None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay. </p>



<p>My friend who was present told me Twitch security were also behind the booth afterwards joking about how they didn‚Äôt even see what happened and immediately laughing and moving on to talking about something else.</p>



<p>So if no one was checking if I was okay or if I needed anything and they let the guy run away initially, I have no idea what anyone hired to keep the event safe was doing LOL </p>



<p>In Twitch‚Äôs statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained, I‚Äôm sorry but that is a blatant lie. He was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn‚Äôt hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because Twitchcon staff present thought it was a big deal. </p>



<p>I have a lot more I want to say but I will say it on stream later today instead of writing a book on here. </p>



<p>Thank you guys again, sorry you all had to see that. This is definitely my last Twitchcon, and it saddens me to say as a 10 year off and on attendee of Twitchcon, I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can‚Äôt imagine how creators without those options would feel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some have compared the gravity of the event to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36506082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shooting of Christina Grimmie</a>, a YouTube star turned professional artist who was gunned down in Florida almost a decade ago during an autograph signing event. It‚Äôs impossible to know the intentions of some before it‚Äôs too late.</p>



<p>This video shows the moment Emiru was assaulted:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following Emiru being assaulted at TwitchCon, her fans took to social media platforms to hurl accusations and insults at Twitch for their handling of the incident, which has now been revealed as lacklustre at best.</p>



<p>TwitchCon continues to be a source of controversy and ill topics regardless of where it‚Äôs held or what Twitch does to keep it as secure as possible. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you‚Äôve got any horror stories from this year‚Äôs TwitchCon event.</p>

Now, a new Nintendo patent filed in April and published this week has ignited rumours about Nintendo DS games potentially returning in the future.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613">Mike Odyssey on social media (via GoNintendo)</a>, the three methods of dual-screen gaming detailed include "Dual Screen (Parent and Child Screens), Single Screen Mode (Picture in Picture) and Switch Mode (Switch between Screens)". You can <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3ZAZvTXYAACnrb?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096">read the abstract and see each image</a> in the post:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nhtmup&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The Nintendo DS library previously appeared on Wii U's Virtual Console service. It featured over 30 games and supported touch interaction on the system's GamePad. Considering this particular collection has already appeared on a Nintendo online service, it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if it did resurface at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a patent, so it doesn't necessarily guarantee anything is in the pipeline for the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library, and it could just be Nintendo going about its usual business. If we do hear anything else about this latest discovery, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It‚Äôs the end of another week, but hopefully your streak has made it to the end, too! We‚Äôre looking at the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions in this guide, helping you to figure out the fastest way to solve today‚Äôs puzzle. It‚Äôs not so tough, but if you want to continue your streak quickly and get on with your day, you‚Äôll want to scroll down.</p>



<p>Here are the top NYT Connections hints for today, October 19.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today‚Äôs NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It‚Äôs relatively simple, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That‚Äôs in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What‚Äôs critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it‚Äôll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-19">Today‚Äôs NYT Connections Hints (October 19)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today‚Äôs NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I‚Äôll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you‚Äôll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today‚Äôs puzzle, #861:</p>



<ul>
<li>SPINE</li>



<li>BUG</li>



<li>MARSH</li>



<li>FREAK</li>



<li>JACKET</li>



<li>SKORT</li>



<li>COVER</li>



<li>FALL</li>



<li>FLIP</li>



<li>WIPEOUT</li>



<li>LEAVES</li>



<li>TUMBLE</li>



<li>DOVER</li>



<li>CRUNCHY</li>



<li>WIG</li>



<li>SPILL</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today‚Äôs NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>‚Äì <em>Unsteady footing? These words all suggest sudden loss of control</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> ‚Äì <em>Parts of a book‚Äîor a tree</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> ‚Äì <em>When emotions run wild‚Ä¶</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> ‚Äì <em>Odd mix, but think geography and fashion</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here‚Äôs the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 19.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-19-861">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 19 (#861)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today‚Äôs NYT Connections puzzle, I‚Äôve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>‚Äì FALL, SPILL, TUMBLE, WIPEOUT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> ‚Äì COVER, JACKET, LEAVES, SPINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> ‚Äì BUG, FLIP, FREAK, WIG</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> ‚Äì CRUNCHY, DOVER, MARSH, SKORT</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That‚Äôs today‚Äôs puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that‚Äôs <strong>your </strong>local time). You‚Äôll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon‚Äôs God of War TV Series Casting Call Has Leaked]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-has-leaked.1328797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A casting call for Amazon‚Äôs upcoming God of War adaptation has leaked online from one of entertainment‚Äôs biggest insiders.</p>



<p>PlayStation‚Äôs iconic God of War series has entertained players since 2005. Unfortunately, a Hollywood adaptation has never been successfully done or thought of. In 2022, Prime Video announced that the reboot titles would be brought to streaming as a show, with many of the game‚Äôs crew producing. Just recently, reports of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2026 shooting date</a> have surfaced, meaning production is getting into motion. Now, it seems one of the most anticipated parts is underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-leaked-details-characters-and-plot">God of War TV Series Casting Call Leaked, Details Characters and Plot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to industry insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1979632388855779583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>, notable for his credible movie leaks, Prime Video‚Äôs God of War is currently casting for the show. In particular, a casting call for several characters, including descriptions, is available and shows some insight into the show‚Äôs direction. We see what the team is looking for for Kratos, Atreus, and other parts. The exact descriptions can be found on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/141416746?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK‚Äôs Patreon</a> and on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1oa9013/god_of_war_tv_series_casting_call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> dedicated to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the Reddit post theorizes which description matches which God of War character, it‚Äôs up in the air. Regardless, take the leak with a grain of salt, as always. Still, it‚Äôs interesting to note a few things about the casting call. First is the description for series regular Alexander, which sounds a lot like Odin. However, Odin only makes a full appearance in Ragnarok, meaning the show may not follow the games too closely. Another interesting bit is for Joshua, likely Atreus, it lists him as a ‚Äòone-year series regular‚Äô. This likely means that the show intends to find another actor to play the part after the first season. Atreus, in the games, does grow up, but they kept the same actor, Sunny Suljic, the whole time. </p>



<p>Given Amazon‚Äôs God of War‚Äôs upcoming start date, it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll have casting by the end of the year. Still, knowing these descriptions, fans can come up with even better fancasts and speculate. A few weeks back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kratos-actor-shortlist-outlined-by-movie-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors for Kratos surfaced</a>, and while some may not fit the description anymore, actors like Dave Bautista and in-game actor Christopher Judge still count. </p>



<p>Are you excited for Amazon‚Äôs God of War show? Who do you think would make a good Kratos and Atreus? Any other good casting choices? Let us know in the comments and on the official Insider Gaming Discord!</p>

<p>The first script draft for the Sleeping Dogs film adaptation is finished, according to its actor and producer.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover police officer in Hong Kong, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU‚Äôs Shang-Chi actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/">Simu Liu</a>, who‚Äôll star as protagonist Wei Shen. Now, according to the actor himself, it‚Äôs farther along than we thought.</p>



<h2 id="h-simu-liu-gives-new-update-on-sleeping-dogs-film-adaptation">Simu Liu Gives New Update on Sleeping Dogs Film Adaptation</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu‚Äôs Twitter/X</a>, the actor posted two pictures, with one being of his sleepy dog, Chopa. The other image was of the official Sleeping Dogs script. In the caption, shown above, it seems it has been completed and likely sent in for feedback. Interestingly enough, the name of the writer is blocked, so it could be a surprise new addition or director. Still, after scripting is casting and, eventually, filming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While out of the blue, it‚Äôs good to know Sleeping Dogs is proceeding well with an adaptation. In the past, Donnie Yen of Rogue One fame was set to bring it to Hollywood, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing turned out</a>. Fortunately, Simu Liu has been very vocal about his desire to make it happen, even producing it himself. While Sleeping Dogs didn‚Äôt sell well for games, it may now get another chance with Hollywood.&nbsp;</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>About 400 other Blizzard workers voted to do the same earlier this week</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a busy week for union organisers at Activision Blizzard. Yesterday, in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a group of over 100 developers that work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> and the mobile only strategy game Warcraft Rumble voted "strongly in favor of wall-to-wall union representation." This comes after around 400 Blizzard platform and technology workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/around-400-blizzard-platform-technology-staff-are-the-latest-microsoft-workers-whove-voted-to-unionise">voted to unionise</a>, also with the CWA.
</p>
<p>
The union is made up of numerous roles such as quality assurance testers, artists, designers, software engineers, and producers, having been particularly inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> devs that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">voted to unionise last July</a>. Organising committee member and game designer Dominic Calkosz said in a statement, "My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals. We chose to organise in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity that the industry cannot ignore."
</p>
<p>
Not that there's ever a bad time to form a union, but you can easily understand why these devs are putting in the work to do so right now. From <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">entire, massive game cancellations</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">sweeping layoffs at Microsoft</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-mass-layoffs-microsoft-exec-insists-return-to-office-mandate-is-not-about-reducing-headcount">policy changes</a> that might as well be more layoffs, it is not a secure time to be a game developer right now. Big solidarity to the newly unionised workers.
</p>
<p>
Also worth mentioning as part of ongoing internal tensions at Microsoft is its offering of its Azure cloud services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the country's military enacts its invasion of Gaza. The contracts related to these specific services were <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">recently cancelled</a>, but Xbox <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians">remains a target of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement</a>. For more on how the game industry remains connected to this ongoing issue, you can check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">this piece from Edwin</a> where he spoke with various game devs and tech workers about it.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games has revealed a new map for the game, set inside an abandoned restaurant. The location--Neil's Diner--was unveiled during a TwitchCon panel that celebrated the recent fifth anniversary of the co-op horror game, and players can explore it starting November 11.</p><p>Kinetic Games described Neil's Diner as a "run-down, retro restaurant" that's been long-abandoned by staff and diners alike. While this is one of the smaller maps in Phasmophobia, it's still full of authentic details and phantoms hungry for thrills.</p><p>"We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life," lead developer Daniel Knight said in a press release. "Alongside the farmhouse reworks from this year, Nell's is an example of how we want all the maps in Phasmophobia to feel going forward. It's unique, and has been meticulously designed to tell more of a story to our players--beyond the immediate ghost they‚Äôre hunting."</p><p>Phasmophobia will be releasing into version 1.0 next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-dev-is-preparing-to-shake-things-up-again/1100-6535210/">but this is just the start of Kinetic's big plans for its hit game</a>. An upcoming overhaul--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-dev-promises-overhaul-that-will-make-it-feel-like-a-new-game/1100-6533159/">dubbed Horror 2.0</a>--will release alongside the 1.0 launch, and the studio says that the update will make Phasmaphobia feel like a new game. Hollywood is also calling, as production company Blumhouse--Five Nights at Freddy's, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/">is adapting the game for the big screen</a>.</p>

            <p>
I think if you were to travel back in time to around the 14th century to wherever Dante Alighieri was at the time, and showed him <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-maiden">Hell Maiden</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, bullet hell, deckbuilding, '90s anime-esque, essentially fan fiction sequel to his Divine Comedy, he'd probably say something like "Mama mia" and die on the spot in fear of what his own creation spawn hundreds of years later. Yet as ridiculous a concept as it is - and it is ridiculous - the demo for it is quite good.
</p>
<p>
To compare it to other games, Hell Maiden is like a mash-up of Hades and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, the latter leading the charge in moment-to-moment gameplay. You play as Dante himself, or in this case, herself, who is back in hell after having reached Paradiso, with amnesia. And so she begins the ascension to heaven once more!
</p>

<p>
When you start off, you're armed with Dante's quill, which sends out fiery blasts every second or so akin to Vampire Survivor's whip. You can have up to four weapons (at least that appears to be the limit in the demo), said weapons represented as cards. Leveling up gives you the opportunity to choose from three new cards, which most of the time will be weapon modifiers, doing things like adding more projectiles, increasing damage, that sort of thing, but you'll occasionally get new weapons to use.
</p><p>
If you pull a duplicate modifier card, you can fuse them with another to improve it, or place it on a different weapon if you so choose. There are even some cards that can affect multiple weapons depending on where you place them. 
</p>
<p>
Like in other Vampire Survivor clones you don't have much control over your attacks, though you can point them in one direction while moving in another, so you do have some control. This feels solid too, at no point did I feel frustrated or overwhelmed by what was on screen, I know each of my deaths was my own fault. It's all quite tightly woven together, especially impressive considering that whenever the game does launch it'll do so in early access.
</p>
<p>
The Hades element crops up in the form of narrative structure more than anything. Upon death you're brought to The Forum, a hub area where you can hang out and chat with various Poets of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, such as Homer, Virgil, and Horace. It seems that befriending them lets you unlock other starter weapons, and they all allow you to pick up different weapon and modifier cards too.
</p>
<p>
All of this is wrapped up in an incredibly well rendered vaguely '90s anime art style, at least when it comes to the dialogue scenes. The rest of the game is mostly pixel art, but there are special moves you can use that do screen-wide damage following some stellar, fully animated cutscenes showing off these anime girlified versions of, I would like to remind you, very real poets.
</p><p>
For the most part just mashing up genres, even if it's done well, doesn't inherently colour me interested in a game, but with its extremely well realised concept, I am currently sold on Hell Maiden. I just hope no one invents time travel so Dante doesn't die sooner than he was meant to.
</p>
<p>
Hell Maiden doesn't have a release date just yet, but when it gets one, it'll launch in early access. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372060/Hell_Maiden/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

<p>A live-service Halo game may be in the works at Halo Studios, one reliable insider claims.</p>



<p>If you know Xbox, you know Halo. As a beacon for the FPS genre, the sci-fi series has been going on since 2001‚Äôs Combat Evolved. With the upcoming 25th anniversary coming up and the Halo World Championships next week, the hype for more Halo is huge. Halo Studios themselves confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-halo-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we‚Äôll see something new</a> revealed there, likely the Combat Evolved remake. However, according to a credible YouTuber, we may actually see another new project, this time in the live-service genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-studios-may-release-a-live-service-halo-title-in-2026">Halo Studios May Release a Live-Service Halo Title in 2026</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video</a> from Halo Youtuber Rebs Gaming, who previously leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Virtuos co-development</a> for Halo CE, a new entry in the franchise will be revealed soon. The game, which will be live-service, is expected to drop next year, meaning two Halo games could come out then. Rebs says their source told them it will be similar to Fortnite, though they don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll feature Battle Royale. No other information was provided, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned, a new Halo-focused showcase event&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-new-deep-dive-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced</a>&nbsp;for the Halo World Championship on October 24th, 2025. The deep dive has been hyped by Halo Studios ever since last year. With the Halo CE remake all but confirmed, a new spinoff would be welcome news to fans. Even more so, having two new titles in 2026 makes for one great anniversary plan. Either way, fans of the series may be in for a treat come October 24th.</p>

            <p>
It's been a while since we've last seen anything FIFA in the world of video games, namely because EA took a gamble on saying goodbye to the sports association's official licence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-officially-ditch-fifa-and-will-rename-the-series-ea-sports-fc-from-next-year">back in 2022</a>. Whether that has paid off, literally, is neither here nor there right now though, as FIFA announced this week that it has signed a "multi-year partnership" with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager</a>, once again bringing its recognisable (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32897066">if potentially tainted</a>) name back to video games.
</p>
<p>
Well, technically this is the second FIFA game connection since the EA split, seeing as earlier this month it also revealed <a href="https://youtu.be/qKWU52Et1ww?si=CDiUYE_OJLJ0nC8I">FIFA Heroes</a>, but that one's just for phones so we can ignore it for now. In any case, this particular deal sounds like it will go into effect pretty soon, as there'll be official licences for things like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fifa-world">FIFA World</a> Cup, the Women's World Cup, and Club World Cup.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-and-fifa-sign-multi-year-partnership">blog post</a>, all this FIFA stuff will be coming as part of a "playable, revamped International Management module," coming to Football Manager 2026 sometime next year, ahead of the World Cup itself - that kicks off (pun intended) the middle of June, so this update will at least be out in the first half of the year. Said blog post also notes that kits for all 48 of the participating teams in the world cup will be included, as well as some broadcast graphics and tournament branding.
</p>
<p>
Is any of this particularly necessary? Probably not, but it does show that FIFA is still quite interested in having a games presence. Time will tell if that recent, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-ea-workers-slam-billion-dollar-buyout-for-risking-layoffs-to-pad-investor-pockets-while-senators-worry-about-saudi-arabia-rewriting-us-history">internally controversial</a>, private <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buyout of EA</a> will see EA Sports FC get its old name back.
</p>
<p>
Football Manager 2026 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2026-will-be-coming-home-soon-enough-with-a-november-release-date">due out next month</a> on February 4th.

            <p>Workers in Blizzard's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-arclight-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a> teams have voted to unionise with the Communications Workers of America.</p>
<p>Over 100 software engineers, designers, artists, quality assurance testers, and producers voted to join the CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, California, joining 1900+ other Activision Blizzard employees who have similarly chosen to unionise. Parent company Microsoft has reportedly recognised the union.</p>

<p>"My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals," said organising committee member and game designer Dominic Calkosz. "We chose to organise in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity which the industry cannot ignore."</p><p>The move comes shortly after CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. met with workers at Blizzard's Irvine campus to "celebrate the growing wave of organising across the industry" as unionised staff across Activision Blizzard <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-president-claude-cummings-jr-visits-video-game-members-ahead-bargaining-session">joined the World of Warcraft Bargaining Committee</a> "for a solidarity walk as contract negotiations continued".</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pay-rises-ai-regulation-and-layoff-protection-what-activision-blizzards-newly-unionised-employees-want-from-microsoft">spoke to members of Blizzard's story and franchise development team about their union</a>, discussing their demands from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union issued a statement</a> against the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">proposed private acquisition of the company</a>, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets". Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dualsense-v3-battery/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-dualsense-v3-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-removable-battery-despite-rumors.1328659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite previous rumors that the DualSense V3 will have a removable battery, it has been debunked by tech reviewer and content creator Austin Evans.</p>



<p>In his latest video, the content creator looked at the latest PlayStation 5 Pro SKU, which was rumored to be bundled with a new DualSense V3 controller dubbed ‚ÄòV3. However, the latest revision of the controller certainly does not include a removable battery, although it is a different battery from those used in previous controllers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dualsense-controller-might-have-removable-battery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original rumor of a detachable battery originated</a> from the Polish retailer PPE, so it‚Äôs entirely possible that the rumor was lost in translation somewhere, as almost everything else from their PlayStation 5 Pro and controller report was accurate.</p>



<p>That being said, a removable battery for the DualSense does make a lot of sense. Still, with the latest revision having not implemented it, it‚Äôs likely a feature we won‚Äôt see until the next generation.</p>



<p>You can watch the whole YouTube video from Austin Evans below, which, at face value, does show that the PlayStation 5 Pro has some minor changes. One of them is a reduction in the console‚Äôs weight ‚Äì a change that has become a common theme in these revisions.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As for what‚Äôs next for PlayStation, well, all eyes are on its next generation, which will, somewhat obviously, be called the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>In an exclusive report by Insider Gaming, we reported that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a> is planned to feature a detachable disc drive, which was first introduced midway through the PlayStation 5‚Äôs lifecycle.</p>



<p>What do you think of the DualSense v3 not featuring a removable battery? Are you disappointed? Let me know what you‚Äôre thinking on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>
Like whatever genres you like, but for me personally, I find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformers</a> to be the quintessential video game genre. Even with the most challenging entries, there are very few other genres that (when done well) are as easy and quick to pick up, play, and have fun with. I think that's why so many of them have such longevity, one such game being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/n">N++</a>, a tough but fair platformer that's celebrating its 10th anniversary with a new update.
</p>
<p>
Available now and appropriately titled TEN++ (as if there was any other choice), it's quite a simple update: more game! Which translates to more levels across the game's solo, co-op, and race modes. For solo there's two new level sets, titled "?!" and "!?" respectively, with co-op and race getting one level set each, both titled TEN++. In a trailer announcing the update, developer Metanet Software said that there's "no way anyone 100%'s it‚Ä¶ for real this time!"
</p>

</a>
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/2025/celebrating-10-years-of-nplusplus">blog post</a>, the devs got a bit candid about working on N++ too, saying that "by 2018, we were very burned out, having worked tirelessly on N++ over 6 years. We took a little break - but the thing is, we always come back to making levels. Those of you who have tried it may understand; it‚Äôs just fun to do, and somehow there are always new ideas to be uncovered." Subsequently, over the years, they've kept making more levels, having "rediscovered what is so special about this game," thanking the game's community for its enthusiasm in helping them do so.
</p><p>
Oh, and there's another bit of good news too: Metanet Software have started development on their next game. They're keeping quiet about it for now, but you can <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/newgame">sign up to hear about it</a> (and potentially play its beta) further down the line.
</p>
<p>
And if you've never played it before, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/">it's currently less than three quid on Steam</a>, an offer that's hard to turn your nose up at.
