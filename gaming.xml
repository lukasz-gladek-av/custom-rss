            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/882241/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement">just announced he’s leaving the company</a> after 12 years leading Xbox and nearly 40 at Microsoft in total. His replacement: Asha Sharma, formerly <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/speakers/5e943e22-f2b6-4443-b8b0-55749176a169">head of development for Microsoft’s AI enterprise teams</a>. Before that, she was COO of Instacart for three years, and spent four at Meta in charge of the company’s messaging apps.</p></div><p>What will Sharma do with Xbox? Read for yourself in her first internal memo, which we’ve printed in full below.</p><p>Sharma says she is committed to “the return of Xbox,” games in “new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most,” and that games will “always will be art, crafted by humans” while promising not to “flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.”</p><p>However, she also says that “monetization and AI will evolve and influence this future,” and it sounds like Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073286/xbox-console-exclusivity-hardware-update-game-pass">will still pursue Xbox Everywhere</a> — she isn’t returning to the definition of Xbox as a physical box alone. While she does promise “a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console,” she writes that Xbox will “expand across PC, mobile, and cloud” as well.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear team,</p><p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p><p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p><p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.</p><p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.<br>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p><p>That starts with three commitments.</p><p>First, great games.</p><p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.<br>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p><p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p><p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p><p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p><p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p><p>Third, future of play.</p><p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p><p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p><p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p><p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p><p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p><p>Asha</p></blockquote></div><p>And here’s the full memo from Matt Booty, who is now Microsoft’s chief content officer and EVP of Microsoft Gaming:</p><div><blockquote><p>I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p><p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p><p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p><p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p><p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p><p>-Matt</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo]]></content:encoded>

In a memo entitled “A new chapter for Microsoft Gaming,” Spencer reveals to Xbox employees that he made the decision to retire from Microsoft last fall.</p><p>He also reveals Xbox president Sarah Bond is leaving Microsoft, triggering a big change of management at Xbox. Asha Sharma, currently the president of CoreAI product at Microsoft, is stepping into the Microsoft Gaming CEO role, reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.</p><p>Here’s Phil Spencer’s full memo on his retirement:</p><div><blockquote><p>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</p><p>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p><p>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team.Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</p><p>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</p><p>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</p><p>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</p><p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</p><p>Phil</p><p>XBL: P3</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/882340/xbox-phil-spencer-microsoft-retirement-memo]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">Xbox boss Phil Spencer is retiring after 12 years</a> leading Microsoft’s gaming division. His replacement is Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI Product division.

While many assumed his replacement would be Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, that wasn’t the case. Bond is also leaving Xbox alongside Spencer. Instead, <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/speakers/5e943e22-f2b6-4443-b8b0-55749176a169">Sharma</a> has been chosen to lead the Xbox division, and in her first memo to the company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">obtained by </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">The Verge</a>,</em> the former head of AI at Microsoft promised “the return of Xbox” and claimed she would avoid flooding Xbox with AI slop, but that it would “evolve” and be a part of Xbox’s “future”</p>

 <p>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,” said Sharma. “Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</p> <p>The new Xbox boss also promised that more great games were coming.</p> <p>“We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything,” said Sharma. “Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative gameplay, and creative excellence.

 <p>As for future consoles, something Xbox has previously confirmed and teased, Sharma says the company will “celebrate” its fans and history with a “renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console.” Though the new boss made it clear that Xbox isn’t going back to being simply a console and the brand will continue to expand to more platforms, like mobile and streaming.</p> <p>“Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware,” said Sharma. “As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In major breaking news on Friday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced that Micorosft Gaming CEO and head of Xbox Phil Spencer is retiring from the company. </p>



<p>In addition, Xbox President Sarah Bond has resigned.</p>







<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Spencer’s retirement will be effective as of Monday, February 23.  He leaves after spending 38 years with the company.</p>



<p><strong>“I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,”</strong> Nadella said via email to Microsoft and Xbox staff. <strong>“Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms.”</strong></p>







<p>Spencer, in his memo to staff, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-retiring-from-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that he made</a> it known last year that he was <strong>“thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.”</strong></p>



<p>Taking over as head of gaming for Microsoft is Asha Sharma. Sharma had previously been the head of CoreAI at Microsoft after joining the company in 2024. Matt Booty, who will remain with Xbox, is moving up to chief content officer.</p>



<p>In his first message to Xbox staff, Sharma said that they won’t flood the market with “soulless AI slop”.</p>



<p><strong>“To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love,” </strong>he wrote. <strong>“But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[BioShock Movie Could Tie Into New Game, Production May Start in 2027]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-movie-could-tie-into-new-game-production-may-start-in-2027/</link>
            <guid>1442251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roy Lee, the producer of the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock/" id="1100">BioShock </a>movie, has provided an update on the forthcoming Netflix film and hopes that it will tie into an upcoming game release.</p>



<p>The announcement of Netflix taking on a BioShock adaptation first came in 2022. 4 years later, there is an explanation for why the project has been dormant and when things could actually start progressing toward production.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-projects-took-precedence-over-bioshock">Other Projects Took Precedence Over BioShock</h2>



<p><a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Collider’s</a> Steve Weintraub, Lee stated that production would have begun sooner, but other projects, including The Long Walk and a Hunger Games prequel, got in the way. However, he says the project could tentatively be next up for him, and that both Netflix and Take-Two are hopeful the movie will come out and tie into a future game release.</p>



<p>“I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock-4/" id="702">fourth BioShock game</a> was announced in 2019. Last year, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick promised the game would release.</p>



<p>Lee didn’t want to fully commit to a date for when production could begin. Still, he says he’s hopeful things will get started in 2027.</p>



<p>“I know that the intent is to hopefully get in production next year,” he said.</p>







<h2>Video Game Adaptations Are Plentiful on Streaming Platforms</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer will retire effective February 23, and <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,547 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> president and chief operating officer Sarah Bond has resigned, according to emails sent to Microsoft staff today (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>).

Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the ’90s to the accelerated‑compute era we’re in today.</p><p>As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at <a title="Platforms > Meta [166 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.</p><p>Matt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt’s career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, <a title="Companies > Activision [73 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/activision">Activision</a> <a title="Companies > Blizzard Entertainment [156 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard</a>, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including <em>Halo</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Candy Crush</em>, and <em>Fallout</em>.</p><p>Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across <a title="Platforms > PC [25,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and <em>Minecraft</em>; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I’ve long admired Phil’s unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.</p><p>We have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.</p><p>Please join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer, Retiring Microsoft Gaming CEO</strong></p><p>Subject: A New Chapter for Microsoft Gaming</p><p>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</p><p>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p><p>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</p><p>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</p><p>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</p><p>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</p><p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</p><p>—Phil</p><p>XBL: P3</p><p><strong>Asha Sharma, New Microsoft Gaming CEO</strong></p><p>Dear team,</p><p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p><p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p><p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.</p><p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</p><p>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p><p>That starts with three commitments.</p><p>First, great games.</p><p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.</p><p>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p><p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p><p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p><p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p><p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p><p>Third, future of play.</p><p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p><p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p><p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p><p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p><p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p><p>—Asha</p><p><strong>Matt Booty, Xbox Chief Content Officer</strong></p><p>I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p><p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p><p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p><p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p><p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p><p>—Matt</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-retires-xbox-president-sarah-bond-resigns]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059</link>
            <guid>1442209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After more than a decade in charge of Xbox, Phil Spencer is retiring from his position at the top of Microsoft’s Gaming Division, as laid out in a story from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter"><em>IGN</em></a>. Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, is also leaving the company. </span></p> <p>Asha Sharma previously president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, has been promoted to CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty is being promoted to chief content officer. Spencer will remain at Xbox through the summer in an advisory role.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Last fall, I shared with Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life,” Spencer said in an email to employees. “From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sharma laid out her hopes for the future of Xbox in her own email, in which she said she wants to spearhead the “return of Xbox,” and also said that she wants to commit to human-made work and reject “soulless AI slop.” The email read as follows:</p>

 <blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it. That starts with three commitments. First, great games. Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most. I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Second, the return of Xbox. We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world. We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Third, future of play. We are witnessing the reinvention of play. To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Booty said in his own email to staff that he was “excited” to work with Sharma and was encouraged by his early conversations with the incoming CEO.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success,” Booty wrote. “She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.”</p> <p><span>Spencer has been with Microsoft since 1988 and has been with the Xbox brand since 2001, helping to launch the original console against the PS2 and GameCube 25 years ago. He was promoted to the head of Xbox in 2014 shortly after the launch of the Xbox One, and has remained a face of the brand for 12 years, operating as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming since 2022.</span></p>

 <p><span>The departure comes after a long struggle to put Xbox back on top of the console gaming ecosystem. Alongside milestones like Game Pass and acquiring Activision Blizzard there have also been plenty of game delays, cancelations, layoffs, and studio closures. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911"><span>Soft sales of the Xbox Series X/S</span></a><span> compared to the PlayStation 5 and Switch in the most recent generation pushed Microsoft to take many once-exclusive games multiplatform, doing what was once unthinkable and bringing <em>Halo</em> to Sony’s rival gaming platform.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Xbox division has reportedly been under significant pressure from Microsoft to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>reach abnormally high profit margins</span></a><span>, which some speculate has played a part in the rise of prices for Xbox consoles and subscription services in recent years.</span></p>

A number of the Nier works shown in that video have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoko-taro-reportedly-teased-nier-3-with-repent-concert-message">seemingly teased more Nier to come</a>, but it's never quite been the AAA video game rendition fans wanted. The story has been told and sequelized through many different mediums at this point, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-mobile-game-shuts-down-in-april">no-longer-available mobile game</a> that's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">effectively a direct sequel</a>, but no full-blown PC/console game has emerged in the last nine years. Maybe other fans feel differently, but it's left me a bit jaded at the idea. Even Yoko Taro sounded a bit weary when he was last asked about it, saying that he was trying to make new projects, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-creator-yoko-taro-is-still-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-canceled">but they kept getting canceled on him</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a shame, because Nier: Automata rules. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review">gave it an 8.9/10 when we reviewed it in 2017</a>, saying it's "a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay. It may not include the most sensical story or compelling characters, but its frenzied combat -- coupled with beautiful visuals and a stunning soundtrack – make it too much fun to pass up."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">PlayStation’s decision to shut down Bluepoint Games</a> went over very poorly with fans. Unfortunately, the bad vibes are coming right as Bungie is getting ready to launch<em> Marathon</em>. Frustrated comments are now clogging up the PlayStation social feeds as some PS5 players threaten to boycott the extraction shooter and any future live-service games from Sony.</p> <p>On February 19, Sony confirmed it was shutting down Bluepoint Games, a studio that has become well respected for its high-quality remakes and remasters of older games. The studio was caught up in<a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404"> Sony’s live-service shuffle</a> after the <em>God of War</em> online spin-off it was reportedly working on was shelved, and none of its other pitches were approved. The news upset a lot of people, including developers and fans. And now, <em>Marathon</em>, a live-service shooter from Bungie and Sony, is set to release in two weeks and has become a target for frustrated players tired of Sony’s online game push.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two weeks to go.</p> <p>Marathon, Bungie's futuristic PvPvE extraction FPS,&nbsp;launches March 5. Try the Server Slam at no cost February 26 to March 2: <a href="https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8">https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8</a> <a href="https://t.co/slN6eLb3jS">pic.twitter.com/slN6eLb3jS</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On Thursday, t<a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466">he official PlayStation account on Twitter posted</a> a boring marketing tweet hyping up players by reminding them that <em>Marathon</em> was just two weeks away and a free beta was launching even sooner. But if you check the replies, people aren’t hyped. They are the opposite of hyped. Mad players still reeling from the Bluepoint news are claiming that they will boycott <em>Marathon</em> entirely, while others are simply hoping it will flop or <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">calling it the next <em>Concord</em>.</a></p> <blockquote><p>“Refunded! Im not going to support any GaaS from PlayStation after closing down BluePoint Games,” said one user with a screenshot claiming to show the return.</p> <p>“This game will be a major flop for you guys! Watch us not buy this trash and destroy it with reviews. I will never forget what you did to Bluepoint,” posted another fan.</p> <p>“I’m thinking not to support this game, after today’s disappointing announcement,” said someone else on Twitter.</p> <p>“I’m definitely not playing this out of spite. Bluepoint doesn’t deserve to get shut down. If it weren’t for <em>Demon’s Souls,</em> I wouldn’t have bought a PS5 at launch,” claimed one player.</p> <p>“I hope everyone boycotts <em>Marathon</em> for you closing Bluepoint,” shared a different user.</p></blockquote> <p>And it goes on. As of 1:30 p.m. EST on February 20, the tweet has over 1,900 replies, and many of them are from fans angry with Sony and the Bluepoint news. Over on YouTube, the comments aren’t nearly as aggressively anti-<em>Marathon</em>, but you can find plenty of newer replies claiming they will boycott the game or wishing for <em>Marathon</em> to flop. It also seems like PlayStation has stopped posting on social media due to the backlash, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/sony-goes-silent-on-social-media-as-fans-turn-feral-following-bluepoint-closure">as pointed out by <em>Push Square.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

 <p>Will any of this actually hurt <em>Marathon</em>? Probably not. Angry gamers claiming they intend to boycott a popular game and then playing it anyway is a common trend, as seen in this classic image of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/a40ji/modern_warfare_2_boycott_fail/">C<em>all of Duty</em> players in a boycott <em>MW2</em> group playing the game on launch day</a>.</p>

 <p>So yeah, I find it hard to believe that most offline gamers who aren’t scanning sites like <em>Kotaku</em> and Reddit daily for news and leaks even know Bluepoint is closing up or could even name the studio if asked. Still, games like <em>Marathon</em> need a dedicated playerbase that will stick around through all the updates, and often those players are the terminally online sickos out there following game accounts on Twitter and keeping up with the news. It seems that for many of these gamers, <em>Marathon</em> is exactly what they don’t want more of, and Bluepoint’s death has only galvanized them against Sony’s live-service push.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Final Fantasy is now targeting PC as its "lead platform"]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/why-final-fantasy-is-now-targeting-pc-as-its-lead-platform/</link>
            <guid>1442143</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>For a long time now, PC gamers have been used to the Final Fantasy series treating their platform as somewhat secondary to the game’s core console versions. There are some signs that may be starting to change, though, as director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed that the PC is now the “lead platform” for development of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">a recent interview with Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi clarified that the team takes the relatively common practice of creating visual assets for its multiplatform games by targeting “high-end environments first,” then performing a “reduction” for less powerful platforms. These days, that means “our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation,” he said. Players have already noticed this graphical difference in the PC version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, Hamaguchi said, and “our philosophy will not change for the third installment.”</p>
<p>While PC gaming is only “gradually expanding in Japan,” Hamaguchi said the rapid growth in international PC gamers has led the company to “develop assets with the broad PC market in mind.”</p>
<p>The PC versions of recent <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> games have sold well on Steam and the Epic Games Store, he added.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if that means PC gamers will have to wait longer than console owners for future Final Fantasy games. The first <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> didn’t hit PCs until <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-on-pc-a-gorgeous-start-but-where-are-the-toggles/">19 months after the PlayStation 4 version</a>, and <em>Rebirth</em> was first available on PC 11 months after its PS5 launch. Elsewhere in the franchise, the PC versions of both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/no-offensive-or-inappropriate-final-fantasy-xvi-mods-producer-pleads/"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/final-fantasy-xv-on-windows-more-beauty-more-frame-rates-maybe-fewer-bugs/"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em></a> didn’t hit until over a year after their console counterparts.</p>
