            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The campaign for the newest edition of <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> has launched on Kickstarter. The new <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition refreshes the iconic superhero TTRPG with streamlined rules, simplified character creation, and a new suite of superpowers.</p><p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greenroninpub/mutants-and-masterminds-4th-edition/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition will retain the bombastic superhero action and creative freedom of the superhero RPG, just with some quality-of-life improvements.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The game, which debuted in 2002, is built around an award-winning RPG system. Every action in the game is resolved by a single d20 roll. In addition, there are no character classes, but a point-buy system, allowing you to make just about any larger-than-life costumed hero you can imagine. From there, adventures can range between fighting aliens, thwarting would-be conquerors, or stopping rampaging monsters.</p><p><em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition will retain this system. A d20 roll still resolves everything.. Players will still make characters using a pool of Power Points, but the core rulebook will contain 15 hero archetypes (The Paragon, The Battlesuit, etc.) which serve as templates for new players.&nbsp;</p><p>The new core rulebook does add some new twists to this formula. It will include new rules for different heroic feats, advantages, and superpowers. The newest edition will also include Reactions to the game, introducing new tactical options in superhero brawls. Lastly, the book will feature artwork by comic artist Sean Izaakse.</p><p>For older fans, the digital stretch goals of <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition contain some throwbacks. The goals include older prewritten Astonishing Adventures updated to the new system, such as A Cold Day in Midtown, Into The Idiot Box, and Rise of the Tyrant. There is also a gazetteer for Earth Prime, an introduction to the game's core setting written by the game's creator, Steve Kenson.&nbsp;</p><p>The different pledge tiers for <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition are as follows:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ed18be609d6f65fc398410faecb4caae2"><em>Hero's Handbook PDF for $25:</em> A digital copy of the Hero's Handbook and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e28ca8875493aa545649e0ba6c3524edf"><em>Hero's Handbook and GM's Kit for $40:</em> Digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e7ef65ca7aa87e51a50d1489f292d0e2f"><em>Hero's Handbook Print and PDF for $50:</em> A physical hardcover and digital copy of the Hero's Handbook, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e340ff38a66bdd099536c9fedc9d5d5b2"><em>Hero's Handbook and GM's Kit Print and PDF for $80:</em> Physical and digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="ef3bb1299d4234d5ae891236646d07436"><em>Campaign Starter for $140:</em> Physical and digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, a set of physical hero tokens, reaction tokens, and a condition deck.</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, the campaign for <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds </em>Fourth Edition has raised $116,921, more than twice its initial funding goal of $50,000, and has unlocked all digital stretch goals. The campaign ends on March 5, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>A recent update to Steam allows developers to list a planned 1.0 release date for their Early Access games. While developers have always been free to share this information in blog posts or in the description on the store, in the past, they couldn't flag a game's planned release so clearly.</p>
<p>While this might seem like a small change, I'm thrilled to see it. Steam Early Access can be an excellent tool for developers, allowing them to put their game into players' hands and earn money without waiting until it's ready for a 1.0 release, but it can be a mixed bag for players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its best form, an Early Access game launches in a playable (if unfinished) state, it then receives a string of updates, before eventually ending in a full release. But there are many games that never make it all the way to 1.0. As much as a developer may wish to finish a game, if they run out of funds, they might choose to move onto another project entirely. There are more than a few Early Access games in my library that haven't been added to in years, and I know the developers have either shut up shop or moved on to something else.</p>
<p>Before buying a game that's in Early Access, I now find myself having to become a detective – checking for when it was last updated or seeing if the developer is working on another, more recent project. I don't want to distrust the game maker, but I also don't want to spend money on an unfinished game that will never see its final version.</p><p>While <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/500597484211404992?l=english">Valve's latest update to Steam</a> doesn't change things radically – as I say, developers were free to write about the planned 1.0 release dates before, both on Steam and off it – it does make it a little easier when browsing games to see if a project is nearly finished or still a long way off. A developer could still blow through a release date or delay it, but this seems somehow more concrete and easier to hold a game maker accountable.</p>
<p>There is more to this change than first appears, too. As Valve say "Last year we introduced the Steam Personal Calendar, and realized one valuable kind of 'release' was missing from the UI: upcoming transitions from Early Access to 1.0. With an official 1.0 date display, we could give those transitions an official display in Personal Calendar, and help address the developer requests around formally showcasing the planned 1.0 release."</p>
<p>This means that if you wishlist a game that's in Early Access, it should now appear in your personal calendar when it's near a 1.0 release. So, if you're not keen on buying a game that's in an open-ended Early Access state, but you're happy to pick up a copy when you know it's definitely coming out and near release, you can now do that more easily.</p>
<p>So, as I say, a small change, but a welcome one.</p>

            <guid>1430251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://defector.com/super-bowl-lx-was-the-beatdown-that-will-leave-no-trace">Super Bowl 60 is over.</a> The Seahawks won it all. Bad Bunny’s performance was amazing and just what was needed at this time. And as usual, there were many, many expensive commercials in-between all of the action. As has been the case for the last few years, basically every ad featured celebs and big-name actors selling out to help promote AI, donuts, crackers, and more. And almost all of it fucking sucked shit. It’s depressing to watch talented actors sell out. So many of the ads were for awful products. Nothing about them was even fun or memorable.</p> <p>This year, for the first time in a bit, I decided to skip the Super Bowl. So instead, I only saw people’s reactions to the ads via social media, and it sounded bad. But when I woke up this morning and mainlined all of the ads, I was shocked to discover it was worse than I expected and even worse than the previous star-studded sell-out showcase that was Super Bowl 59. American culture’s marketing machine has hit a new low.</p>

 <p>Many of the ads featured random assortments of celebs that seemed picked by rolling the dice. Worse, some of these ads used CG to de-age the celebs, compounding the horror. Many of the ads were too long and felt like nearly every marketing agency around the country has forgotten how to actually sell people stuff. The worst part of the night was Dunkin’ Donuts attempt at making a joke about ’90s sitcoms that seemingly started and ended with the same juice-less punchline: “Noted Dunkin’ lover Ben Affleck was in a movie that sort of rhymes with our company’s name.” A few million dollars later, the end result was this CG-face-filled cameo-packed nightmare.</p>  <p>Xfinity also got in on the de-aging celebs action with an ad that, on paper at least, sounds like a winner. What if <em>Jurassic Park</em> actually worked because our company’s internet powered it? Could be funny, but it’s hard to laugh when faced with CGI smooth-skinned versions of the film’s stars inhumanely moving around like haunted wax figures.</p>

  <p>Here’s a great way to sell AI-assistants: Spend a minute showing all the ways it could murder you.</p>  <p>MrBeast was here too and wanted to sell you AI. He also demonstrated that despite making videos for years online, he seems to have zero charisma on camera. How was this the best take?</p>

  <p>Then we have the case of Sofía Vergara, who wins the award for biggest sellout of the night for appearing in three different Super Bowl 2026 commercials. Look, <a href="https://youtu.be/9OvibwfflDg">$26 million mansions don’t pay for themselve</a>s, okay?</p>     <p>Meanwhile, Uber Eats continues to run with this marketing campaign built around some made-up conspiracy about food and the NFL, and… look, I have no idea why this is supposed to be funny or entertaining.</p>

  <p>Don’t worry, Matthew Broderick was here to sell AI that will do your job for you in an ad that feels like Genspark had to pick its star after all the other companies already had theirs and got stuck with Ferris Bueller showing people how to AI-maxx at their lifeless office jobs.</p>  <p>Remember that thing from the 80s that was popular? I hope so, or otherwise this commercial won’t make any sense.</p>  <p>Medicine maker Novo Nordisk’s Super Bowl ad wins the award for “Most Random Celeb Appearances” by shoving anyone who was available in LA on a Tuesday a few weeks ago into it.</p>

  <p>This is like one of those SNL fake ads featuring a real product, but somehow even less funny.</p>  <p>I’m so tired.</p>  <p>There are so many of these.</p>  <p>Please, I can’t keep watching all of these bad, boring, unfunny ads starring sellouts.</p>

  <p>I’m tapping out here. This isn’t even all of them, but it’s enough to see that marketing agencies are cooked, AI companies are desperate, and actors no longer feel shame for selling out to sell crackers. Bad timeline. We need to shut it all down and start over.</p> <p>As I said last year, stars and actors have been popping up in commercials for a long time. But around the time we entered the 2000s, something changed. To quote Zack from 2025:</p> <blockquote><p>Sure, if you dig through history you can find numerous examples of famous&nbsp;<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/51/1b/25/511b2500e00c3eddc3fca5968a3020b9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actors and artists appearing in ads</a>, even during the height of their career. It definitely happened. However, it was still a fairly rare occurrence and most big-name actors were careful about appearing in too many. For example, Tommy Lee Jones and other Hollywood stars would&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fly over to Japan and other countries to do commercials</a>&nbsp;so nobody over here in the States would see them. There was still a fear that if you sold out&nbsp;<em>too&nbsp;</em>much and&nbsp;<em>too&nbsp;</em>often you’d look desperate and signal that your career was ending. And this was the case for decades.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Then Super Bowl commercials became bigger and bigger in the 2000s</a>&nbsp;and companies spent more and more to create a viral, popular ad. And as this was happening, the lines between TV, movies, and internet content started to blur, while streaming services and YouTube grew in popularity. Hustle culture—the belief that as long as you were getting paid it was worth it—also grew during this time.<a href="https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I remember people in 2015 cheering Kim Kardashian</a> for appearing in a big Super Bowl ad and celebrating that she “got paid!” That has led us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly every damn Super Bowl ad</a> including big name actos to help sell soda or crackers. And it’s all so sad.</p></blockquote> <p>See you next year when a de-aged Mark Hamill uses AI to help him blow up the Death Star alongside Snoop Dogg and some ’90s actor who needs to buy a new car.</p>

<p>The announcement of the next Sony PlayStation State of Play presentation caught the eye of a major actor from the Detroit: Become Human video game.</p>



<p>Early in the day on February 9, Sony confirmed that its next PlayStation State of Play would take place on February 12. Not only did many PlayStation players react to the news, but so did one actor from a major video game released during the PlayStation 4 generation.</p>



<p>Bryan Dechart, who provided the motion capture and voice for Connor in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/detroit-become-human/" id="2059">Detroit: Become Human</a>, responded to the news with the eyes emoji and an exclamation point.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-dechart-s-excitement-could-mean-many-things">Dechart’s Excitement Could Mean Many Things</h2>



<p>Dechart is closely associated with Detroit: Become Human, as he lent his likeness and voice to the role of Connor. However, Dechart is known for more than Detroit in the video game space.</p>



<p>He also appeared in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/red-dead-redemption-2/" id="541">Red Dead Redemption</a> and voiced Brennan, among others, in Cyberpunk 2077. He’s also attached to Lunafon: Tales of the Moon Oak, an <a href="https://rokitstudios.com/lunafon">upcoming hand-drawn 2D Adventure inspired</a> by Welsh culture. He also streams on Twitch. Therefore, his reaction isn’t necessarily a sign that a new game in the Detroit universe is on the way.</p>



<p>He streams on Twitch with his wife, Amelia Rose Blaire, who was also featured in Detroit. Together, they founded <a href="https://www.dechartgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dechart Games</a> and are currently working on their own release, The Grand Prismatic, a branching narrative game.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-likely-is-a-detroit-become-human-sequel">How Likely Is A Detroit: Become Human Sequel?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quantic-dream/" id="147">Quantic Dream</a>, the studio behind Detroit, Heavy Rain, and other hits, isn’t necessarily against making a sequel. </p>



<p>CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/david-cage-on-quantic-dream-future-next-gen-gaming-and-not-ruling-out-sequels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">David Cage told WCCFTech </a>in 2020 that they’re open to making sequels for any of their projects, as long as there’s more to say about the world and its characters. Doing a sequel for profit is not the studio’s mindset.</p>



<p>“It may sound naïve from a CEO with 20 years in the industry, but I continue to think that any project should be heartfelt,” he said.</p>



<p>PlayStation has many projects in the works, including the upcoming Bungie release Marathon, Saros, the Wolverine game slated for this year, and more. Learn more about the forthcoming State of Play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-february-state-of-play-officially-confirmed/">here</a>. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide full coverage of the event on February 12.</p>

            <p>No, Blizzard is not preparing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> 2 announcement for BlizzCon 2026, I've been told, but there is something significant being announced later this year.</p>
<p>The company aroused suspicion for a sequel during a Hearthstone broadcast this afternoon, while announcing a Cataclysm-themed expansion for the World of Warcraft card game. The company teased that a major announcement was coming at BlizzCon 2026 in September, and for something bigger than usual.</p>
<p>I watched this 'spotlight' broadcast at Blizzard headquarters, just over a week ago, so I was able to quiz the team afterwards about it. I asked executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith whether we were talking about something as significant as a sequel, and he put me straight.</p>
<p>"No, this is not a Hearthstone 2," Lyons-Smith told me. "There's no whole new game that is launching as part of that. Over the years we've done mixes, new types of content, new modes and such in the game, and it will be of that familiar ilk."</p>

<p>However, the BlizzCon 2026 announcement will still be especially notable. Familiar, yes, but "in a bigger way than we would normally do"," Lyons-Smith said. "Bigger than what's happening with Cataclysm."</p>
<p>Cataclysm arrives for Hearthstone on 17th March and reimagines the World of Warcraft expansion of the same name. That means world-breaking dragon Deathwing is back, and he's bringing some colossal pals with him. Literally colossal: Colossals are returning to the game.</p><p>These are mega-minions who, in the case of Magmaw, for instance, a giant lava worm, fills all available minion spaces with their wormy body, and keeps refilling them whenever any segments are killed. Magmaw has 99 minion recharges, so you can begin to see what kind of a problem that card represents. The other Colossals are similarly chonky.</p>

<p>Cataclysm also brings new keywords, a new story, and powerful new abilities like Rewind that allow you to redo some plays. Also, on 10th March, one week before the expansion arrives, Blizzard will make every card from the recent Un'Goro and Emerald Dream expansions available to everyone for the duration of the Cataclysm expansion cycle, which is nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hearthstone-isnt-on-console-switch-or-steam-deck-but-increasingly-likely-to-happen">But Blizzard isn't yet ready to bring Hearthstone to consoles or handheld devices like Switch or Steam Deck</a> - not officially, anyway. Nevertheless, there's a suggestion this is now more of a priority under Microsoft than it was under Activision before. Could we perhaps be in for a new platform announcement at BlizzCon?</p>

            <p>Blizzard has explained why Warcraft-based collectible card game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, still isn't available on console, 12 years after release. The game is available on handheld devices like tablets and mobile, but has never made the jump to the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> or Steam Deck. In explaining its thinking, the developer suggested that belonging to Microsoft and Xbox means these console conversions are now more of a priority than ever.</p>
<p>"There's a level of investment that we need to make to make that happen," explained Hearthstone executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith during a group interview I was a part of at Blizzard recently, "primarily in terms of UI and UX and making sure that it's very natural to go and play a card game on those platforms. I know it's possible - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013-review">Duels of the Planeswalkers for Magic [The Gathering], many years ago now, was absolutely delightful</a> with the controller - so I know we can do it.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of are there enough players there wanting that beyond who's going to pull out their phone or their tablet to play? It's been so exciting seeing that segment of the market grow such that we can then say, yeah, actually, let's go and do this."</p>
<p>Hearthstone was quickly ported to mobile in 2015, a year after a release, mostly because Blizzard recognised an opportunity there and rushed to fill it, Lyons-Smith said. "We ported that thing to get fast to market and <em>a whole lot</em> more players showed and so it was the right strategic choice at that time," he said. But the Hearthstone codebase is old now, and the quality bar is high on consoles and handheld console machines.</p><p>"I asked an engineer who'd been on the project a long time and he estimates the code is 16 years old," Lyons-Smith said, "and the team was 15 people 16 years ago. And so there's more of an effort to go: 'I want to make sure when we go that it's awesome.' That it doesn't just feel like, yeah, they ported it here and you <em>can</em> play... I want to make sure that when we go, we're going to go and it's going to feel awesome for players that love that form factor, whether they're leaning back on the couch or sitting on the couch with their handheld."</p>
<p>Game director Tyler Bielman echoed that sentiment by saying, "If we're going to bring it specifically to that living room big screen platform, we would want to make sure that the full experience is optimised for that mode that you're in."</p>
<p>Lyons-Smith added: "So let's get there and let's do it right and we'll find the right time to do it."</p>

<p>It was to a follow-up question asked after this that Lyons-Smith made the remark about owner Microsoft being keen to get games on as many platforms as possible. "In the future as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could," he said. "Certainly we have a different owner now than we did three years ago and they're more invested in Xbox and 'anything's an Xbox'. Their high-level goal [being] games playable anywhere."</p><p>Play Anywhere is one of Microsoft's key ideas as it transitions Xbox away from hardware and more towards being a platform-agnostic gaming brand. The idea is that you buy a game once to play on multiple platforms - wherever houses an Xbox ecosystem or app. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Last year's expensive Asus Rog Ally X</a> handheld device was and is a key proponent of this.</p>
<p>Blizzard has just announced a Cataclysm themed expansion for Hearthstone that will launch on 17th March. It'll bring a whole new story to the game as well as reintroduce Colossal cards, which are play-space-filling brutes, and new keywords, funky mechanics, and more. Blizzard is also teasing a major Hearthstone announcement for BlizzCon 2026, though as I discovered, this will not be Hearthstone 2.</p>

            <guid>1430224</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For over 20 years, Like A Dragon has been a video game saga of earnest, positive masculinity wrapped in a tacky suit, a story about men who protect the vulnerable even if it means tearing said suits clean from the lapel to brandish the unshakable values inked on their backs. The values of its developer, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, garnered it decades' worth of goodwill. But lately, its fandom feels that RGG Studio has lost its way in the lead up to the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-puts-kiryu-into-ultimate-dad-mode-and-its-glorious/1100-6537403/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Yakuza Kiwami 3</u></em></a>, especially after the studio’s refusal to dismiss <a href="https://skyboxcritics.com/2025/11/07/hamazaki-has-to-goh-where-does-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio-draw-the-line-on-casting-and-why-is-it-not-at-sexual-assault/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a voice actor who has openly admitted to sexual assault</u></a>.</p><p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> is the latest remake in the Yakuza series. Despite being the remake of a game plagued with the sentiment of being “the bad one,” teeming with promise to change fans' minds with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades?ref=aftermath.site"><u>new coat of paint</u></a>, the vibes around this remake have been rancid, not least because of the widespread calls to remove the voice actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teruyuki_Kagawa?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Teruyuki Kagawa</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/37mtmF0FrPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties | Japanese Voice Cast Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>Since last November, Yakuza<em> </em>fans have been steadfast in an online movement, posting comments on <em>Kiwami 3</em>’s promotional social media posts, demanding that RGG Studio remove actor Teruyuki Kagawa from the cast as one of the game’s big bads, <a href="https://yakuza.fandom.com/wiki/Goh_Hamazaki?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Goh Hamazaki</u></a>. As detailed by Polygon, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/yakuza-3-remake-kiwami-teruyuki-kagawa-controversy-sega/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>#RemoveKagawa movement</u></a> stems from accusations that the actor <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sexually harassed two women</u></a> and an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1o8ehkc/turns_out_kagawa_has_abused_three_different_women/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>alleged third victim</u></a> in 2019. He later admitted to forcibly kissing, groping, and removing the bra of one of the women. Polygon also notes that a second accuser of Kagawa alleges she <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>never received an apology from Kagawa</u></a>. Yet despite the stark controversy, Sega and RGG Studio have not addressed the movement in any capacity—a deafening silence when put to the backdrop of the game in full promotion rollout on social media. However, fans have said that&nbsp; allegedly RGG Studio and Sega have removed comments from YouTube livestreams calling for Kagawa's removal.&nbsp;</p><p>In a January interview with Japanese news site <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2077376.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>GAME Watch</u></a> (which was independently translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-tried-to-think-of-someone-who-makes-you-go-this-guys-a-creep-yakuzalike-a-dragon-director-addresses-controversial-casting?ref=aftermath.site"><u>IGN</u></a>) <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> director <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/yakuza-kiwami-3-remake-smart?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ryosuke Horii</u></a> justified RGG Studio decision to cast Kagawa as Hamazaki because they felt he'd be believable as a creep.</p><p>"Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, 'This guy's a creep,' naturally it was Kagawa—that was the main factor," Hori said. "Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun."</p><p>Although RGG Studio believes fans will get a kick out of seeing Kagawa's portrayal Hamazaki, speaking to a swath of longtime Yakuza fans and writers, the vibes are pretty sour, with many feeling they’re on the cusp of asking whether they can still support the series anymore.</p><p>One person firmly done with contemporary Yakuza games is game critic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ashlikeadragon.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ashley Schofield</u></a>. While writing her <em>Kiwami 3</em> review, she told me she’s had to mull over how much space to give to voicing her pessimism about the state of RGG Studio in her review.</p><p>“And I get to the bottom, I'm like, also, you shouldn't fucking buy this game. I don't give a shit how good it is, I don't give a shit how bad it is, you just should not buy this game,” Schofield said. “I think Kagawa is the single worst choice—and it is a deliberate, knowing choice— that RGG has ever made. It is just incomprehensible and unforgivable.”</p><p>“There's the ongoing joke, and it's not even entirely a joke, of people saying Kiryu would beat Kagawa to death in the street, and they're right,” she added. “There's a real dissonance between what these games have traditionally stood for, and what is currently happening now. There's this idea that RGG doesn't really know what their games are about. It’s fucking crazy.”</p><p>“In a word, it’s grief,” Yakuza/Like A Dragon Wiki “Chairman” <a href="https://x.com/04tenno?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Masu</u></a> told me. “If you’re a longtime fan or even if you can see yourself becoming one, if the series has resonated with you, it’s hard to come to terms with the idea that maybe its driving principle of chivalry is just a power fantasy to be packaged and sold and not a sincerely-held belief. And if you’re a survivor like I am, it’s even harder to lose faith in creators you hoped were in your corner when most of the world isn’t. A lot of us are being forced to close a chapter in our lives [that] we never wanted to close.”</p><p>“Despite everything that happened regarding [Kagawa] and how big a situation it was when the scandal broke, to longtime fans, I think it feels like a betrayal of what they've seen the series to stand for, championing, being a better person, being a good person,” Yakuza<em> </em>video essayist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gcvazquez.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>GC Vazquez</u></a> said. “It feels like the people making [<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>] aren't holding themselves to the ideals they promote in the games or the things that the audience sees in those games.”</p><p>Masu piggybacked on that same sentiment, saying he, alongside other fans who have added “Remove Kagawa” into their Twitter names, has expended their energy into the movement as a bargain with RGG Studio: “Lose Kagawa or lose our loyalty.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We fail, we despair. But I don’t think we’ll ever accept Kagawa’s presence,” Masu said. “We accept the fact of the matter, that RGG Studio wants him there and don’t plan to address why, but Kagawa and his apologists will never be welcome.”</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcement:</p><p>I will not be writing a GameFAQs guide for Yakuza Kiwami 3/Dark Ties.</p><p>Full statement below: <a href="https://t.co/1O90wSjMJQ?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/1O90wSjMJQ</a></p></div>— CyricZ - #REMOVEKAGAWA (@CyricZ42) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyricZ42/status/1999099009881797003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>The outcry has gotten so bad among fans that it prompted <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps5/409974-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/faqs/81106/introduction?ref=aftermath.site"><u>longtime GamesFAQS guides and walkthrough</u></a> writer <a href="https://x.com/CyricZ42?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Scott Zdankiewicz</u></a> to release a statement announcing he doesn’t plan on covering <em>Kiwami 3</em> because of RGG Studio and Sega’s radio silence on #RemoveKagawa.&nbsp;</p><p>“We tend to be a community that's more optimistic even when it comes to things that might not be in our best interest, but this is one of those things that's soured the mood and really hushed a lot of voices,” Zdankiewicz said, regarding the temperature of the Yakuza fandom amid RGG Studio’s radio silence.&nbsp;</p><p>“The complete lack of comment on it from the studio is what really strikes me the most—how they’ve willingly ignored it, and there’s backlash on both the Western side of the fandom and the Japanese side as well,” former <em>Inverse </em>writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/solfleet.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Hayes Madsen</u></a> said. “The dissonance of hiring a dude who admitted and apologized to assaulting a hostess, playing a role in a game that has literal narrative elements about how women in Japan are mistreated, not that Yakuza has always been the best about how it treats its women. But <em>Yakuza 3 </em>specifically has stories like that about standing up for women and trying to push men to be better, and the dissonance is what really makes it bad in this situation.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IOaNzqWpzCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties DIRECT"></iframe></figure><p>While many a fan has also noted<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>’s being an ugly remake, lambasting it for its low-resolution<a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-3-remake-ugly-alleyway-has-fans-concerned-graphics-downgrade-fix-mod-2000662269?ref=aftermath.site"><u> alleyways</u></a>, Zdankiewicz cautions fans to keep things focused on the real task at hand: “The issue of Kagawa and the idea of celebrating a sexual harasser as a face and voice that's going to be present in the series for many years to come.”</p><p>Although it's evident that RGG Studio isn’t removing Kagawa, what particularly bothers Yakuza fans is the inconsistency from the developers, who have removed actors for what fans argue is far less. Key among them was RGG Studio replacing <a href="https://kotaku.com/judgment-the-kotaku-review-1835790070?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Judgment</u></em></a>’s <a href="https://yakuza.fandom.com/wiki/Kyohei_Hamura?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kyohei Hamura</u></a> face and voice actor following <a href="https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/voice-actor-replacement-judgment-west-1203170058/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Pierre Taki’s arrest for cocaine use</u></a> months ahead of the Yakuza spin-off’s release in 2019.</p><p>“It’s a double standard. When you recast the guy who gets caught doing drugs a month before the game comes out in the West—you make the effort to totally recast him, do all the lines—in such a small amount of time, but you don’t do it for the confirmed, self-admitting sex criminal with more time than you had for the other situation, it tells me you don’t condone drug usage, but you’ll hand-wave sexual assault,” Vazquez said. “Whatever I take away from the series, any positive interpretation I can have about its treatment of other people, its treatment of women, it's difficult to justify that.”</p><hr><p>The #RemoveKagawa movement is just the newest drop in an already swelling tide of lost goodwill. For many fans, it’s another sign that RGG Studio has drifted from the scrappy, heartfelt team they once rooted for and into the posture of an old man chasing easy money.&nbsp;</p><p>Once upon a time, RGG Studio was praised for cranking out annual releases by smartly reusing environments and animations—because each new entry still felt like it was pushing the story, the world, and the characters forward. That momentum culminated in the symbolic handoff from longtime series protagonist Kiryu to Kasuga Ichiban in <em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But since then, whether out of hesitation with a new protagonist or a desire to lean harder into Western popularity, Ichiban has been sidelined into preorder‑bonus roles in smaller Kiryu‑centric spin‑offs, or as a duo act where he shared the spotlight with Kiryu—a character RGG Studio has killed off twice. While earlier titles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/a-short-yakuza-is-a-good-yakuza/"><em><u>Like A Dragon: Gaiden</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/game/multi-platform/like-a-dragon/infinite-wealth/.206773?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Infinite Wealth</u></em></a><em> </em>landed anywhere from decent to alright, others—like the Majima‑focused <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-game-review-1235270755/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</u></em></a>—is giving a <a href="https://aftermath.site/pirate-yakuza-hawaii-impressions-review-majima/"><u>studio spinning its wheels</u></a>.</p><p>Not just that, but players are getting less with each new installment. The pattern is hard to miss: locking <a href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-new-game-plus-sega-1851180210?ref=aftermath.site"><u>New Game Plus behind a paywall in<em> Infinite Wealth</em></u></a>, or planning to delist the standalone <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/psa-if-you-want-a-copy-of-the-original-yakuza-3-pc-remaster-without-also-paying-for-6-other-games-youd-better-snap-it-up-soon/?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Yakuza 3 </em>on PC ahead of <em>Kiwami 3</em>’s release</u></a>—moves that nudge players toward pricier editions or full collections. Each choice deepens the sense that the studio is nickel‑and‑diming the very audience that kept the series afloat.</p><p>Longtime guides, writers, and reviewers for the Yakuza<em> </em>series feel the fandom is at an impasse with the developers. An impasse not helped by the fandom’s wary sense that the developers have created a disappointing double standard, leaving a bad taste in fans’ mouths, alongside the growing feeling that the once-adored annual recycled-asset developer has been spinning its wheels while losing touch with what makes Yakuza Yakuza.&nbsp;</p><p>“That asset reuse and pumping things out as fast as they did, I think people were willing to be on board with that when the games were really doing interesting things narratively and were really being compelling,” Madsen said. “You look at [<em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em>], which is maybe the most narratively compelling game in the series, in my opinion, and when they had that spark to it, it was a little better. But you can see the pieces start to fall apart with <em>Infinite Wealth</em>, then <em>Yakuza 0: The Director’s Cut</em>, and the <em>Kiwami </em>games. It just feels like over time, the wheels started to fall off more and more.”</p><p>Madsen argued that the vibes feel a bit off with Yakuza, partially because the series has gotten too popular for its own good. Viral prankster Druski is doing ads for the games, despite the Black culture stimulus package influencer likely knowing zero to shit about the series while giving it a mainstream push.&nbsp;</p><p>“The series’ explosion of popularity has been detrimental to it to a degree where Sega sees it as a cash cow. Every game sells more and more, so they’re like, ‘Well, this works, so we’re just going to keep doing this.’ People like what RGG Studio does, and they get all this positive PR over how fast they put games out, and their development process really fed into that,” Madsen said. “That may change in the future based on reception to <em>Kiwami 3</em> and other recent stuff, but I think Yakuza has been a victim of its own success.”</p><p>Madsen likened Yakuza’s current conundrum to the cast in fellow Sega series<em> Persona 5</em>, where games like <em>Royal </em>blew up in popularity and created beloved characters in its wake, which Sega went on to reuse ad nauseam despite their stories having ended.&nbsp;</p><p>Vazquez admitted to being a little cynical about his sentiments toward the series since <em>Gaiden</em>, saying the annual release of the games has made it so continuity isn’t respected, stakes don’t matter, and whatever happens to recognizable characters won’t last the length of the series like they used to because storytelling doesn’t matter, generating a profit does.&nbsp;</p><p>“I saw somebody mention that RGG Studio is trying to build up to some <em>Avengers: Endgame </em>moment with its characters. In [<em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em>], they brought back a ton of characters we thought were dead,” Vazquez said. “<em>Infinite Wealth</em> kept doing that. <em>Gaiden </em>kept doing that. It doesn’t feel like the series has its identity anymore. It feels more like they’re trying to ape off of some other recognizable thing or do something that’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-infinite-wealth-animal-crossing-1850959672?ref=aftermath.site"><u>popular with some other </u></a>franchise. To me, that just feels very boring, for one, but also very uninteresting in regards to what Like A Dragon historically is and what I like about it.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tl-BxsU0iz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="There's No Good Way To Play Yakuza 3 | Castle Super Beast 357"></iframe></figure><p>“[RGG Studio] have nothing to lose from keeping<em> Yakuza 3</em> <em>Remastered</em> up for sale. In fact, it being widely available [is] was what gave them the confidence to go in such a radically different direction with the remake in the first place, because it meant they wouldn’t be competing experiences. To renege on that shows a lack of faith in both games,” Masu said. “Sega and RGG Studio’s recent business practices overall seem to suggest they think what they stand to gain in a few extra bucks will make up for what they stand to lose in player agency and goodwill, but I don’t think it’s going to pay off for them.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-i1f3iw5yBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Yakuza is not in a good place..."></iframe></figure><p>Two guiding ideas from longtime studio head Toshihiro Nagoshi and Horii, come to mind for Masu when he thinks back on his years with Yakuza, and they feel especially relevant during the #RemoveTagawa movement. One is Nagoshi’s long‑held belief that <a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-creator-doesn-t-want-kiryu-beating-up-women-in-f-1845622609?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kiryu should never harm women</u></a>. Nagoshi departed RGG Studio in 2021 to found his own development studio. The other is Horii’s reminder that there’s no value in making games that wound their audience or push them away.&nbsp;</p><p>“By siding with Kagawa over the women and survivors in the community, they are perpetuating societal indifference to the violence they’ve condemned in and out of their games. They are hurting and driving away the most vulnerable members of their audience, as well as anyone who stands with us,” Masu continued. “They are betraying RGG’s earliest fans, Shinjuku hostesses who appreciated how the games represented their occupation, and are they going against the wishes of the hostess Kagawa victimized, who doesn’t want to see his face everywhere.”</p><p>“I've realized that I don't think I'm gonna buy another game from this studio, which is an insane thing for me to feel, considering that, and I am not exaggerating here, <em>[Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em>], for various reasons, literally saved my life. I would not be here if I had not played <em>Yakuza 7</em> in November of 2020. This series is very important to me,” Schofield told me while showing me her Yakuza-inspired tattoos over Zoom. “I sometimes feel like I just kind of have to cauterize the wound and accept whatever I felt about it in the past six years from 2020 onwards is never coming back. It's only getting worse, and I can't in good faith support and feel anything about this series or this studio anymore.”</p>

<p>For some fans and critics, the changes have proven controversial. And while we're not sure we can call this version the "definitive" release, our reviewer Mitch did have high praise for the many quality-of-life changes, scoring the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Switch 2 release a 9/10</a>:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196061 @ 1770659645 -->
<p>With the Dragon Quest franchise is doing better than ever worldwide, and the 40th anniversary coming up later this year, there's never been a better time to be a fan. So, newcomers, veterans, and slimes, we want to hear what you think about Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined on Switch 1 or Switch 1.</p>
<p>With a whole weekend under your belt, perhaps you feel strongly about the changes and you love them? Or maybe there's an island or a gameplay element that you miss that brings the experience down? Whether you've finished it (did you sleep?) or are just a few hours in, you can give the game a score below and, if you change your mind later, come back and rescore.</p>

            <p>The upcoming God of War series has finally got its Atreus, as Callum Vinson has been cast as none other than the son of Kratos.</p>
<p>He comes from prior work as a young Jason Voorhees in Crystal Lake, as well as Piglet in Me &amp; Winnie the Pooh. He also has a history of voice over work, having played Lope in Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island. It makes sense, after all, that an archer would have range. I'll be here all night, folks.</p>
<p>As well as the God of War series, Vinson is set to play a role in both season three of The Night Agent, a popular Netflix drama.</p>

<p>Vinson comes in the wake of some other impressive casting calls, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-has-a-head-for-casting-with-the-return-of-mimir-actor-alastair-duncan-confirmed">including Alastair Duncan returning to the role of Mimir from the games</a>.  Odin and Thor also have assigned actors, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-keeps-casting-characters-from-ragnarok-adds-severance-and-homeland-stars-as-odin-and-thor">Mandy Patinkin and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson taking these antagonistic roles respectively</a>. Kratos too has been chosen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">with Ryan Hurst taking the lead role</a>.</p><p>This God of War adaption, being produced by Amazon, has still yet to have a release date as of writing. Nor does it have a proper trailer announcing it to those not paying attention to early casting decisions. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">it is already approved for a second season</a>. The show also has some stellar talent directing it, including Frederick E.O. Toye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">who'll be taking the lead over the first two episodes</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think of this casting decision? Is Vinson the right actor for the role? Let us know!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> player-numbers are currently the strongest they've been on Steam since the game arrived there, spiking ahead of the game's first expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrives tomorrow, 10th February.</p>
<p>Sunday, 8th February saw approximately 70,000 people playing Overwatch 2 together on Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a> - which is only 5000 fewer than when Overwatch 2 launched there in August 2023. The game has struggled to break 60,000 concurrent players since then.</p>
<p>The numbers aren't gigantic - they put Overwatch 2 39th in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">Steam's Most Played list</a>, which is notably lower than competing hero shooter Marvel Rivals, in 21st - but Steam isn't the only platform Overwatch 2 is played on. The primary home of Overwatch 2 is Battle.net, so the true number of people playing Overwatch 2 is likely to be markedly higher.</p>

<p>It bodes well for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Overwatch 2, which undergoes a bit of a relaunch this week</a>, dropping the "2" from its name and welcoming five new heroes at once - and further five throughout the year - in a huge, unprecedented-for-the-game, expansion-like release. And the plan is to do these expansion-like releases every year. There's a lot to unpack, as I found out when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">I travelled to Blizzard recently to learn about Overwatch's bold new plan</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-review-a-brilliant-teamplay-experience-in-the-grip-of-an-existential-crisis">Overwatch 2 launched in 2023, after a year in early access</a>, controversially overriding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> 1, a game that no longer exists. Overwatch 2 moved the series to being fully free-to-play, supported by a Battle Pass, and changed group sizes to five from six. It was a rough transition, but lots of good work has been done on the game in the years since, reintroducing 6v6 battles and ironing out a lot of Battle Pass kinks, and adding significant new game modes like Stadium, in which you can mechanically customise a hero similar to how you would in a MOBA - earning new abilities as you play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Callum Vinson</strong>, who you might recognize from the <strong>Chucky</strong> TV series or the recent mini series, <strong>Long Bright River</strong>, has been tapped to play <strong>Atreus</strong> in <strong>Amazon's God of War TV series</strong>, a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-callum-vinson-atreus-1236656985/">Variety</a> has confirmed.</p>



<p>It's the latest major casting announcement for the show, with Vinson joining the likes of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/">Danny Woodburn</a>,</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>,</a> to name a few. That said, we'll mostly see Vinson alongside <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong>, who is set to lead the show as <strong>Kratos</strong>.</p>



<p>The official character description and logline for the show, included in Variety's report, also give us a clearer picture as to where within the storyline the show will kick off. With Atreus described as only being 10 years old, it's clear that the plan is to start with the plot of the first game, before moving into the events of <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, we know from several of the casting choices that, despite the logline describing the plot of the first game (Kratos and Atreus' journey to spread the ashes of their lost wife/mother), we'll see plenty of characters not included in the first game getting introduced in this first season.</p>



<p>With Mandy Patinkin (Odin), Teresa Palmer (Sif), Max Parker (Heimdall), and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (Thor) all set to play characters we don't meet until Ragnarok, it'll be interesting to see how the show weaves the second game's narrative and characters into the first's.</p>



<p>Now that we know who will be taking on the role of Atreus, the remaining major roles left to be filled are <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, two characters that play major roles between both games that will almost surely play major roles in the show as well. </p>



<p>With the show expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> we'll hopefully find out who will be stepping into both roles very soon. So far, Alastair Duncan and Ryan Hurst are the only two cast members who worked on the games that will also work on the show.</p>



<p>Here's the full cast list so far for Amazon's God of War TV series, led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a></strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>
</ul>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aethus">Aethus</a> is a crafty new sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> in which one woman and her flying drone pal excavate a layered underground world on behalf of a galactic megacorp. You’ll create a surface base from holographic modules, gather evidence about a doomed science expedition, research a wacky new element, and unearth the dirty secrets of your employer. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds a lot like Coffee Stain’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, with opportunities for automation later on, but it’s viewed from an elevated third-person perspective, and appears more narrative-driven. Satisfactory through the eyes of Diablo? I can - as we space miners like to say – 'dig it', though I’m quite weary of games about being the lonely stooge of some breezily villainous extraction racket. This particular seam of satire has long since been gutted. I am ready for games in which we go to other planets for Nice reasons. I feel like that ought to be possible. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

<p>
Aethus is the work of Edinburgh, Scotland-based Pawsmonaut Games, whose founder Alex Kane is a former Rockstar QA tester, Build A Rocket Boy scripter (in various capacities), and Splash Damage senior technical designer. Aethus is his first self-funded and published project, and he seems very keen on doing it Right, with a Steam page that boasts of being “fully committed to old-fashioned ethical game development”, with “no use of AI, no early access, no microtransactions or purchaseable cosmetics.” Which is maybe overegging your rectitude a little - we have well and truly entered the age of using no-AI assurances for marketing - but I like the forthrightness. 
</p><p>
I’m also keen on what I’ve seen of the caves in Aethus. Any game about chewing through volcanic strata in pursuit of long-dead boffins is talking my language. I’m less enthused about the mining, which seems lumbering and charmless – laser 100 boulders, then drag the bits from your inventory to the fabricator. The modular base components have more charisma – you can build glass tunnels with the requisite, mildly hopeless coffee tables and plant pots - but they're very in keeping with other games in the genre.</p>
<p>In addition to being bored of survival games featuring cheerily bastardacious mining companies, I am ready for the “next generation” of base-building, whatever that looks like. I’m tired of bolting holograms together. I'm not alone in harbouring these misgivings. Why, only this week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-lot-of-survival-games-are-really-boring-abiotic-factor-developer-says-many-game-makers-are-too-focused-on-mechanics-and-not-enough-on-vibes">argued that</a> -
</p>

The generated video shows a fight between </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>characters Vi, Jinx, Ekko, and Warwick.

 <p><span>There’s an odd lack of narrative cohesion, with the video making no attempt to logically string shots together.

 <p><span>While we wait for the AI bubble to burst, generated art is creeping into just about every facet of pop culture.

            <guid>1430152</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After last year’s swashbuckling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review"><u>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</u></a> triumphantly hoisted the black flag, this year developer Ryu Ga Gotoku has set its sights on elevating the Yakuza series’ black sheep. While well-received critically upon its original 2009 release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> sluggish combat and uneven story pacing has seen it age about as well as leftover sashimi, leaving it to linger at the back of the pack while the Like a Dragon series has pushed forward into exciting turn-based twists and experimental spin-offs. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, then, is a much-needed retooling that ratchets up the fun factor of its fighting and smooths out most of its unwanted story creases, resulting in an enjoyable return to the largely underused island setting of Okinawa – even if not all of its changes and additions were powerful enough to uppercut me off my feet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it received an HD remaster in 2019, I must admit I haven’t revisited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> since it first debuted on PlayStation 3 because I couldn’t bear the thought of once again battling my way through its annoyingly block-happy hordes. The bulk of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> enemies were so stubbornly resilient to Kazuma Kiryu’s attacks that getting further than a few hits into a combo was a struggle; instead of gleefully breaking jaws, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> fighting felt more like painfully pulling teeth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, that has all changed with Kiwami 3, which dramatically speeds up enemy encounters and endows Kiryu with two flexible fighting styles to cover all his thug-bashing bases. His default stance is classic Dragon of Dojima, a mix of satisfyingly weighty combo attacks and wrestling-style grapples that hit harder than a shotgunned can of Suntory Highball. As entertaining as that is, however, I found myself largely relying on his secondary stance, which arms him with eight different weapons. Those range from the baton-like tonfa to inflict stun, a pair of scythes to inflict bleed, brass knuckles to break guards, a shield to deflect blades and bullets, and a pair of nunchucks to regularly look like a total badarse with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a versatile and violent fighting style that transforms Kiryu into a lightning-fast, leisure suit-wearing shinobi, and it’s supremely intuitive to pick up. There’s no manual weapon switching or inventory management to fiddle with, since everything in his sharp-edged arsenal is triggered by a seamless combination of tapping and holding the three main attack buttons, allowing you to go from slapping a group of gangsters with a wooden boat oar to flinging a pointy pair of sai at their throat without even the slightest pause in the action. The original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> may have ultimately had more weapons to choose from, but given how quickly they would break I rarely bothered to actually use them, and thus I found Kiwami 3’s Swiss Army Knife-style fighting stance a vastly improved method for dealing out wanton destruction using the contents of a Ninja Turtle’s toy chest.  </p><p>Kiwami 3’s Swiss Army Knife-style fighting stance [is] a vastly improved method for dealing out wanton destruction using the contents of a Ninja Turtle’s toy chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiwami 3’s combat doesn’t just feel smoother and more satisfying, it looks a lot flashier too. As was the case with the previous Kiwami remakes, Kiwami 3’s visual design has been boosted to bring it inline with the more modern entries, from the vastly improved character models to the firework-like particle effects that spark off Kiryu’s furious fists. This aesthetic overhaul extends to the environments too, and I was particularly pleased to explore the remodelled slice of Okinawa that features heavily in Kiwami 3’s opening half, since it’s a region that’s rarely been revisited in subsequent Yakuza and Like a Dragon adventures. Its sun-kissed coastal town vibes contrast nicely with Kamurocho’s hustle and bustle, making it akin to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth’s</a> Hawaii – albeit on a significantly smaller scale.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s the Story, Morning Glory?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While Kiwami 3 broadly retains the same outline of the original game’s story, which centres on a spiteful turf war in Okinawa, the developers have treated the plot like a street thug and given it a good punch up. In the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a>, certain chapters confined Kiryu to the Morning Glory orphanage he runs for lengthy periods of time, presenting precious little beyond slowly paging through text-based conversations with its pint-sized residents. Thankfully, Kiwami 3’s structure has been reshuffled to make these sleepy seaside sections entirely optional beyond an initial set of mandatory tutorials, meaning you now have the choice of either taking the time to forge bonds with these little Okinawan Oliver Twists, or just hurrying back to black-belting the Pocari Sweat out of every mobster yakuzin’ for a bruisin’ in the world outside the orphanage’s walls.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d have given me the option of skipping these slice of life segments in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> I’d likely have taken it, yet surprisingly in Kiwami 3 I found myself growing more invested in the plight of Morning Glory’s munchkins than I ever did before. That’s thanks to a smart use of snackable mini-games that transform humdrum domestic chores into stimulating diversions. You can complete the kids’ algebra homework against the clock, go spearfishing for flounder and then transform those ingredients into a meal in an energetic burst of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cooking-mama">Cooking Mama</a>-inspired culinary chaos, or, my personal favourite, steer a sewing machine needle around a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-hang-on">Super Hang-On</a> style circuit made of fabric in a delirious bout of high-speed hemming that regularly left both me and the handcrafted tote bag onscreen in stitches. As I ticked off each enjoyable household task, I found myself bonding with these little wide-eyed waifs in a more organic manner. That meant the stakes felt appropriately heightened later on when Kiryu’s criminal past inevitably catches up with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that Kiwami 3 completely sharpens the original’s storytelling, and there are still some of the series’ signature attention span-stretching conversation cutscenes present here – including one marathon meeting room exposition dump in its ninth chapter that’s so comically drawn out it actually gives you the option of taking regular breaks for Kiryu to stretch his legs by walking around a tiny office he can’t leave. There’s also a surprising twist in Kiwami 3’s post-credits epilogue that will likely raise a few eyebrows among series purists (though was really neither here nor there for me), but by and large Kiwami 3’s main story has been reworked for the better and it kept me hooked for the 17 hours it took me to reach its cathartic, combat-heavy climax.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Japanesey Rider</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere Kiryu goes from playing daddy to slaying baddies in Kiwami 3’s other major addition to its main story, Bad Boy Dragon. This biker gang-based riff on the Devil Flags subquest from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Pirate Yakuza</a> tasks Kiryu with rescuing new recruits from bullies on the streets, splitting them into squads, and accompanying them into large scale clashes against other rival leather-clad clubs, from the easybeats of Okinawa’s streets to the more fierce fighters from Tokyo’s Night Terrors outfit. In between battles you can hold gang rallies to boost the XP of your members, customise your gang colours, and invest in special attacks to unleash in a scrap, from humble hand grenades to spectacularly silly stampeding bulls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Bad Boy Dragon’s novelty wore off far sooner for me than Pirate Yakuza’s equivalent seafaring mode did, because Kiwami 3’s gang-based brawler is considerably more repetitive by comparison. Whereas Pirate Yakuza featured a healthy mixture of cannon-based naval warfare and on-land scraps, Bad Boy Dragon is mostly just a series of samey skirmishes held in copy-and-pasted warehouses that quickly blur into each other. Despite the fact you’re in a biker gang, there’s very little actual biking to be done – you can’t get stuck into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/road-rash">Road Rash</a>-style battles on Tokyo’s expressway like in Lost Judgment, for example. Kiryu’s chopper is strictly used to rapidly ferry him between the four squads under his command before resuming the button-mashed biker beatdowns. Bad Boy Dragon ultimately feels a little half-baked – if you’re going to build a mode around biker gangs, you really need to go the whole chrome-covered hog.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, even though I parked Kiwami 3’s biker mode fairly early on, I found plenty of other things to do outside of the main story. In one moment I’d be struggling to deliver towering ice cream cones through streets lined with waddling sumo wrestlers, while in another I’d be customising my 2007-era flip phone with dangling tchotchkes to boost Kiryu’s health and damage. Later I found myself posing as a host at a cabaret club and disappointing the customers with terrible jokes, as well as indulging in optional mainstays like karaoke and the baseball batting cage. Sure, at this point a lot of these amusements have been repurposed more than the fabric of Marge Simpson’s pink Chanel suit, but I was pleased to find that collectible Game Gear games have been included for the first time in the series – even if it is a bit odd that handheld Sega classics like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/columns">Columns</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-chaos">Sonic Chaos</a> can only be played back at Kiryu’s hideout rather than pulled out of his pocket on the fly. (Perhaps that’s a tacit admission that the Game Gear’s godawful battery life made portable play too impractical?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly I was surprised to find the substory count in Kiwami 3 had been whittled down to 31 from the original game’s 100 or so, but then I remembered how many of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> optional quests were just clones of the same small handful of ideas. Kiwami 3’s substories focus on quality over quantity, and I have no objections to that approach.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Ties that Grind</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of its remodelled main campaign, Kiwami 3 features an entirely new story mode called Dark Ties, which puts the player into the shoes of the sharply dressed and amusingly sardonic antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine. Dark Ties explores Mine’s first steps into the Tokyo underworld, his reluctant alliance with the lecherous Tojo clan heavy Tsuyoshi Kanda, and the complex motivations behind his devastating actions in Kiwami 3’s main campaign. It also allows us to let loose with his ferocious ‘shoot-boxing’ fighting style, which blends fast flurries of punches with acrobatic flip-kicks and the ability to pinball off one enemy and completely redirect your attack towards another to seamlessly continue your combo. He can also unleash devastating ‘Dark Awakening’ special attacks, such as spiking an enemy’s skull into the ground and dragging their faces along the pavement like a bloodied bowling ball. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mine is limited to the one fighting stance, however, and his skill tree is stumpier than a yakuza’s left pinkie. That’s because his quest simply doesn’t last long enough to allow room for any real evolution of his abilities. Dark Ties has been marketed as a fully-fledged game in its own right, but that seems slightly disingenuous given it only features three chapters versus Kiwami 3’s 12, restricts the action to the same Kamarucho setting that Yakuza fans know better than the calluses on the back of their face-mashing fists, and pits you against just two bosses in two fights a piece.  </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan Ogilvie's Top 10 Like a Dragon/Yakuza Games</h3><p>It's Japandemonium!</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/tristan_ign_au/lists/tristan-ogilvies-top-10-like-a-dragonyakuza-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it still took me just over five hours to roll credits in Dark Ties, but that runtime didn’t feel as substantial as it sounds since Mine’s mode regularly gates its story missions behind the arbitrary completion of agonisingly menial tasks. During Dark Ties’ prolonged middle chapter in particular, the advancement of Mine’s story is dependent on performing good deeds for Kamarucho locals in order to slowly boost the reputation of his unlikeable cohort Kanda. A few of these are genuinely entertaining, like being asked to pose as a bouncer outside an adults-only club and evaluating the clientele, but the bulk of them are boring chores like legging it to the nearest convenience store and back so that you can bring a hungry man a bento box. </p><p>Dark Ties has been marketed as a fully-fledged game in its own right, but that seems slightly disingenuous.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tasks like these are made all the more arduous given that Mine isn’t equipped with the same segway-like Street Surfer that Kiryu can whip out on a whim to speed things along in Kiwami 3. I wanted to enjoy Mine’s calculated ascension towards the top of the Tojo clan, but for extended periods, Dark Ties made me feel less like a dragon and more like a dogsbody.        </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mine does have one ace up his pinstriped-suit sleeve, however, and that’s the dungeon-brawling roguelike minigame unique to his adventure. Dubbed ‘Survival Hell’ – despite the fact that ‘Roguelike a Dragon’ was sitting <em>right there</em> – this strictly-timed dash for cash and collectibles takes place across five underground arenas, each consisting of four floors of increasingly challenging goons and culminating in an imposing boss fight. Die during a run and you lose it all, but each floor has an optional exit point should you wish to bank your winnings early and invest them into buffs like special weapons and CPU-controlled bodyguards to better your chances of survival on subsequent runs. It’s compelling, chaotic, and stuffed with countless surprises. Having rolled credits on both Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties, Survival Hell is the one feature of either story that is still calling me back for more.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is a largely successful makeover of Yakuza 3. It finds fun new ways for Kiryu to engage with the orphans in his care, which both livens up the original game’s most boring bits and also made me more deeply invested in the sharper end of its story. Combat has been transformed from a street-fighting struggle to a dynamic delight, and this slice of Okinawa presents a welcome seachange from the series’ more overused city settings. However, the Dark Ties add-on seems like a bit of a missed opportunity since its slight new story is dragged down by some truly tiresome padding, and it’s only partially redeemed by its moreish roguelike mode. On balance, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is another enjoyable blend of hard-boiled drama and sidestory silliness, but as a package it’s not quite as well-rounded as the series’ more accomplished entries. </p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Discord has announced a new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform, meaning age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content."
</p>
<p>
Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features. This builds on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK.
</p>
<p>
Without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands. Nor can they speak on Discord server stages or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know. Additionally, all users will see warning prompts when receiving friend requests from users they may not know.
</p>
<p>
As for the age verification process, Discord is adopting what it calls "privacy-forward age assurance". It says video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" — "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." It does note, however, that while only one verification method will be required for most users, it may sometimes request multiple methods when "more information is needed to assign an age group." Once age verification is complete, user will be alerted via a direct message from Discord's official account.
</p><p>
"Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility," the company wrote in a statement accompanying the news. "We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform."

            <link>https://aftermath.site/genshin-impact-leak-homdgcat-lawsuit-wiki/</link>
            <guid>1430128</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Genshin Impact</em> maker HoYoverse is suing to take down a fan wiki dedicated to its popular game, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/995231354/Genshin-Impact-Maker-Suing-To-Take-Down-Fan-Wiki?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to documents filed in a Georgia court</u></a>. HoYoverse's lawyers say that the person who maintains <a href="https://homdgcat.wiki/about?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the HomDGCat website</u></a>—who goes by the alias HomDGCat—"has engaged in a sustained, coordinated campaign to steal and publicly disseminate" unreleased <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> content and events. HomDGCat describes the website as a place to "efficiently provide[s] data for all players," alongside guides and information about game updates, but HoYoverse claims he’s built it "into a massive compendium of infringing and unlawfully disclosed content."&nbsp;</p><p>The website, which is a thorough wiki with detailed tutorials, character guides, and change logs related to <em>Genshin Impact</em>, is quite popular and useful to players; <em>Genshin Impact</em> players found the website easy to use and the information neat and organized. HoYoverse says it has attempted to "stem [HomDGCat's] conduct" multiple times. In January, HomDGCat announced that he was turning over the HomDGCat Telegram channel to another person after "certain things that happened recently in real life," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1q4tdyw/about_homdgcat_channel/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a post on his Telegram account</u></a>. It's unclear whether he's relinquished ownership of the website as well, but <em>Genshin Impact</em> players on Reddit immediately started mourning the possible loss of the website. In January, the HomDGCat website was also updated with a disclaimer that reads "HomDGCat Wiki will only update live game data in the future.”</p><p>HoYoverse's lawyers say HomDGCat got hold of unreleased content by "exhorting participants in [HoYoverse's] beta testing program to breach their non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations" by giving access to the beta packages to HomDGCat. HoYoverse included a screenshot in the lawsuit of HomDGCat asking beta players to send beta files to him to aid in datamining and research. Using unauthorized access to the beta, lawyers say, HomDGCat was able to get information about updates before they were released, then upload information to his website. HoYoverse lawyers say HomDGCat posted "thousands, if not tens of thousands" of pieces of unreleased content from both <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. Even the publicly available information is a problem for HoYoverse: It doesn't want HomDGCat to use copyrighted artwork at all.</p><p>The HomDGCat website also has a section that includes a way for players to read and search through all text and dialogue for <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, which the company described as "unlawful conduct."</p><p>HoYoverse says the company has suffered due to the leaked content—"negatively impacted public interest and enthusiasm," giving HoYoverse's "competitors unfair insight and knowledge" about unreleased content, and by infringing the company's copyrights. The company says it sent several DMCA takedown notices. In December, lawyers sent HomDGCat emails and physical letters with a cease-and-desist. HomDGCat responded, HoYoverse's lawyers say, and agreed to comply with some demands—but not all.</p><p>"He did not agree to refrain from his unlawful datamining activities or from improperly soliciting beta packets, and all or nearly all of the materials on the HomDGCat Website remain available," lawyers say.&nbsp;</p><p>HoYoverse is asking the court to shut down the HomDGCat website and social media accounts, and for damages related to the alleged harm to the company for trade secret misappropriation, copyright infringement, circumvention of technological measures, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contractual relations.</p><p>HoYoverse has been trying, desperately, to stop its major problem with leaks. It's filed several different lawsuits <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/four-genshin-impact-leakers-targeted-in-new-set-of-dmca-subpoenas-230113/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and sought out leakers via court subpoenas</u></a>, including <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-castorice-leak-lawsuit-hoyoverse?ref=aftermath.site"><u>one filed in June of 2025 over the streaming of unreleased content</u></a>. That leaker didn't show up to court, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-lawsuit-leaker-ruling?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and HoYoverse won a default judgement with a $15,000 fine</u></a>. HoYoverse also went after a <a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en-ca/news/2024/12/dla-piper-secures-infringement-judgment-for-genshin-impact-publisher-hoyoverse?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Genshin Impact</em> hack creator in a Canadian court in 2024</u></a> and won $1.5 million in damages.</p><p>HoYoverse has not responded to Aftermath's request for comment by publication time, and HomDGCat was unable to be reached.</p>
