            <p>"Studio Ghibli" is a genre of game, in the same way "Aliens" and "Blade Runner" are genres of game. Blue skies, wind rustling grass that's a just-so shade of green, a preoccupation with flight? Welcome to Ghibli town, friend.
</p>
<p>You'll find all of the above and several other familiar pieces of iconography in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa">Europa</a>, a puzzle and story-led adventure that's out now.

<p>Europa claims to offer 3-4 hours of adventuring, with secrets, puzzles and hidden dangers to discover. A big focus seems to be on upgrading the movement powers of Zee, Europa's android protagonist, from boosting with his jetpack to fully flying between sky islands. Kaan enjoyed the physicality of the movement when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europas-demo-channels-journeys-gentle-gliding-and-fumito-uedas-classics">played the Europa demo last year</a>.
</p>
<p>The Ghibli-inspired landscapes in Europa are the work of Helder Pinto, who began the game as a side project while working as an environment artist at Blizzard on Overwatch and its sequel.
</p>
<p>I've played plenty of Ghibli-esque games, but I've yet to play one that didn't, in aping the iconography of those movies, strip away much of their meaning and impact. I'm currently playing Ni no Kuni: Wrath Of The White Witch, the Level 5 JRPG which includes cutscenes animated by Ghibli and a Joe Hisaishi score, and as much as I'm enjoying it, even it's guilty of becoming a kind of Ready Player Miyazaki. (I've just arrived in a city of maybe-pig-men, the leader of which is called Porco Grosso.)
</p><p>Maybe Europa is different! Maybe it breathes new life into tropes or pairs them with its own visual ideas! Or maybe it doesn't matter, because 3-4 hours of jetpacking about, solving Zelda puzzles, can hardly be that bad. The demo doesn't seem to be available anymore but the full thing will set you back a mere £11.51/€13.31/$13.49 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2214880/Europa/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronefall">Thronefall</a> is a pleasant, minimalist mashup of tower defence and strategy, in which you build up a base during the day then defend it from monstrous hordes at night. It launched in Early Access in August last year and has been wooing people with its cool colour palette ever since. Now it's hit 1.0.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The 1.0 update adds three new levels, new weapons including a battle axe and blood wand, and some quality-of-life changes, including the ability to peek at future enemy waves so you can plan your defences accordingly. There's more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2239150/view/7516036132726119019">outlined over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Katharine was one of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tower-defence-citybuilding-has-reached-its-peak-with-the-adorable-but-deadly-thronefall">swept off her feet by Thronefall upon its initial launch</a>. 
</p>
<blockquote>Working out what to spend your money on is really the only thing you have to consider here. Of course, with its fixed maps and fixed building nodes, you might think that pairing couldn't possibly be compatible with a good fun time. After all, where does the strategy come in if the game funnels you down a fixed and specific route each time? But that's precisely why Thronefall is so damn brilliant, because when enemies appear from different angles of attack every night (thankfully marked up on your map in advance), it scratches exactly the right cluster of tactical, puzzley brain cells to make it feel devilishly moreish.</blockquote>
<p>Islanders, the previous game from the same developer, was one of the last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-review">Alec reviewed for us</a> before riding his tiny horse out of town.
</p>
<p>It's been a good month for modern, hybrid offshoots of tower defence games, given Diplomacy Is Not An Option also hit 1.0 on October 4th. If Thronefall is your pick of the crop, however, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239150/Thronefall/">grab it from Steam</a> with a 25% launch discount.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-shadow-complex<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Forgotten Gems is a regular column about notable games that have moved out of the public eye and may not be easily accessible anymore. To see all the other games I've covered so far, check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns/forgotten-gems"><em>previous issues of Forgotten Gems</em></a><em> in our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns"><em>Columns</em></a><em> section.</em></p><p>Metroid-like games and their roguelike off-shoots are everywhere today. Not a week goes by without an indie game announcement promising “metroidvania” gameplay elements – and even Nintendo returned to making new Metroid titles after a near six year hiatus following Metroid: Other M in 2010. And that’s me being generous and counting Metroid Prime: Federation Force as a Metroid game…</p><p>But it wasn’t always so. After a Metroid renaissance in the early 2000s with Fusion, Prime, and Zero Mission (what a run!) exploring the series in both 2D and 3D, there was a clear shift away from these classic side-view explorative shooters. Konami stuck it out longer with the “vania” part of the equation and cranked out several quality 2D Castlevanias. But despite the critical success of many of these games, I think it’s fair to say that the genre was diminishing. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Screens - Shadow Complex Remastered</h3></div></output><p>So it was with much excitement that I read on IGN back then that designer Donald Mustard and the ChAIR Entertainment team were planning to make a game based on Orson Scott Card’s dystopian novel, Empire. The two had previously collaborated on the underrated <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/advent-rising">Advent Rising</a>, and early coverage on IGN in 2006 – including whispers that it was going to be a bit of a love letter to Metroid – sounded promising.</p><h2>When Metroidvanias Roamed the Earth</h2><p>“The 2D Metroid and Zelda games were some of my favorite games of all time and to me represented the pinnacle of 2D game design, specifically when it comes to making a non-linear ‘onion layer’ world where exploration and discovery is the core design pillar,” Donald Mustard, former CCO, Epic Games and Co-Founder of ChAIR told me last week.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"…mostly, we had some awesome and innovative ideas and I just wanted to make it and play it." - Donald Mustard</p></div><p>“Our team felt like the genre had been largely abandoned for over a decade, since the advent of 3D gaming, and we really missed playing them. We thought maybe other people missed them as well, or that even a whole new generation of gamers could discover them. I know it’s weird to consider now, but it was also a time when non-physical – aka digital – distribution was ‘just’ becoming viable and games were no longer limited to being put in a box on a store shelf at a cost of $60 or more. It felt like the possibility of what a game ‘had’ to be was ripe for disruption, and it was the perfect moment to try and do something unique. But mostly, we had some awesome and innovative ideas and I just wanted to make it and play it.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/12/card-mustard-1728691979841.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ender's Game author Orson Scott Card (left) and game designer Donald Mustard (right) discuss their then unannounced project, Shadow Complex, in 2006.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Selecting a genre other than first-person shooter or RPG already meant swimming against the current, but releasing Shadow Complex as a digital exclusive in 2009 made it an even bigger wager. At the time, console gamers vocally defended their preference to buy physical media over digital downloads.</p><p>While it cut down on the publisher’s gamble with a non-franchise, niche game potentially gathering dust on store shelves, a digital-only release also risked alienating its potential core fanbase. Luckily, Shadow Complex made a great first showing. The polygonal, 2.5D presentation avoided the game looking like a relic of a bygone era. For ChAIR, going with polygons over sprites was all part of wanting to push the classic 2D Metroidvania formula as far as they could – and that included advanced lighting and effects.</p><p>Shadow Complex is at its core a side-scrolling action-adventure that’s heavy on exploration and platforming, but there are moments where it swings the camera around for third-person action sequences and lets players fire into the background. In a bit of serendipity, perhaps, that approach found its way into the very series that inspired Shadow Complex. The Team Ninja-developed Metroid: Other M similarly mixed 2D sequences with third-person perspective interaction – to its detriment, I’d argue in that case, as it was also tied to a clumsy control scheme. </p><h2>Colonel Mustard, in the Lab, With the Foam Gun</h2><p>One my favorite things about every new Zelda, Mario, or Metroid game is to discover what new powers the designers came up with. Being able to unlock, say, a magical vacuum cleaner, and then figuring out how to use it to solve puzzles is the sort of hook that has me coming back for more time and time again. I just 100-percented Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom this week – and while it didn’t quite live up to the peak combat and dungeon design of the best Zelda games past, it takes and runs with the "multi-use tool" concept in impressive ways. Whether it’s grabbing a water-based enemy to put out flames or building stairways out of beds, getting creative with objects that unlock exploration is half the fun in action-adventure games. Which brings me back to one example of why Shadow Complex stuck with me for so long: the Foam Gun. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/12/foamgunyessssss-1728693795694.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Foam Gun is one of those metroidvania "tools" that's just fun to mess around with. </figcaption></figure></output><p>Turns out, Mustard is also on Team Foam Gun: “I love the Foam Gun too! One of the things that most Metroid games have is a freeze mechanic you can use to freeze enemies in place. You can then use the frozen enemy as a platform to land on or jump off. We loved that mechanic and wanted to extend on the idea – what if you could use a ‘quick hardening Foam’ to ‘freeze’ an enemy or an object but then could stack Foam to build structures or walls or platforms, and then go further and add combinatorial effects like ‘what happens if I shoot foam onto something and then throw a grenade into it?’ We wanted to allow for more emergent and unexpected forms of gameplay. The more we prototyped and played with it, the more exciting it became, and the more we leaned into it as a core mechanic. That kind of philosophy and design heavily influences everything I’ve made since then.”</p><p>The Foam Gun wasn’t just fun to use. It also became an integral way to sequence-break Shadow Complex. At a runtime between five and 13 hours, according to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/8336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HowLongtoBeat</a>, the ability to create yourself your own platforms provided those who knew where to look a way to blaze through the game even faster. There is a moment in Metroid Fusion where the game sort of breaks the fourth wall to acknowledge when a player creatively “breaks” the game and gets to an area in record time. It’s a fascinating bit of meta commentary because it reminds players that for as smart and crafty as they think they are, the designers were actually one step ahead after all. They didn’t just figure out the same trick, they may have designed it in the first place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“I love emergent gameplay, and rewarding players for trying to push the edges of what the game world or a game system can be. As we discovered crazy sequence-breaking opportunities, we decided to lean into them as opposed to ‘fixing them’ as much as possible,” Mustard told me when asked about the Foam Gun shortcuts. “We were very lucky to have Ken Lobb at Microsoft Games give us some incredible advice. It was great working with him. He was part of Nintendo when the original Metroid games were being made and shared some techniques they used to deliberately allow people to find ways to sequence break very very early into the game. It’s a design lesson I’ll never forget. Cough. Fortnite Rocket Riding. Cough. Cough.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/12/bert-lewis-hovership-1728693642555.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Shadow Complex concept art by character lead designer Bert Lewis</figcaption></figure></output><p>When Shadow Complex released in August of 2009, the reception was unanimously favorable. Not only did players love the game, it brought back fond memories of an increasingly underserved genre. </p><p>Naturally, ChAIR started work on a sequel. Mustard: “Finishing the game almost felt like ‘okay now we <strong>actually</strong> know how to make a game like this’ so now we can be much more ambitious with the next one. Our goal can be to really move the genre forward!”</p><h2>Mobile Killed the Console Star</h2><p>While not much is known about the actual project, designers at ChAIR and its parent company, Epic Games, acknowledge that they were working on a Shadow Complex sequel. As late as September 2011, Cliff Bleszinski (then Epic Games design director) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/16/shadow-complex-2-could-still-happen">commented</a> that Shadow Complex 2 was “largely designed” and that Epic needed to find a partner to help finish the game and publish it. But sometimes, better – or perhaps, bigger – is the enemy of the good – and a pioneering mobile game hit led ChAIR into a new direction. </p><p>“We immediately began working on a sequel. Like with Shadow Complex, we designed the entire game map on paper first, then quickly stood it up in a very rough but completely playable form. We got pretty far into preproduction, and in my opinion, it probably would have been the best game I’ve ever made,” Mustard shared. “But… in late July of 2010 we had a very unique opportunity to partner with Apple to make the very first game ever using Unreal Engine on mobile devices. We decided to pause development on SC2 to investigate that opportunity and 4 1/2 months later released Infinity Blade on iOS.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Shadow Complex 2 probably would have been the best game I’ve ever made" - Donald Mustard</p></div><p>Infinity Blade blew up – in part because it showed core gamers that mobile games could be for them – and was quickly followed by a sequel. The two games grossed over $30 million at a time when established publishers and developers alike were still trying to figure out a “there” for them on Apple’s expanding mobile gaming marketplace. Infinity Blade III was unveiled in late 2013 and launched at the same time, complete with an Imagine Dragons song tie-in. It rocketed to #1 in the App Store within hours. But there was an even bigger distraction on the horizon that made a return to the world of Shadow Complex very unlikely. </p><p>Mustard says that creating Shadow Complex was one of the great joys of his life. The team’s goal was to see if they could make something that would live up to the games that inspired it – and then expand upon them and help bring something new to the genre.</p><p>“The right timing to return to Shadow Complex just never presented itself as we soon became very busy with what became Fortnite,” said Mustard. </p><h2>I've Seen the Future and it Will Be</h2><p>As for the future, Mustard left Epic in 2023 to join the Russo Brothers, the directors of Winter Soldier, Civil War, and Avengers Infinity War and Endgame, at multimedia studio AGBO. “I am very satisfied with the work I’ve done in games over the past 20+ years and for now I feel like I have done everything I wanted to do -- with one possible exception,” he told me.</p><p>The good news for fans of metroidvanias – including Mustard who calls out this year’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Animal Well as new favorites (I agree!) – is that the genre is now clearly here to stay. Gone are the days of having to pick between the two flavors “sci-fi” and “gothic” bounty hunter or having to wonder if Metroid: Dread would ever see the light of day. We now have granddaddy Castlevania crossing back into the very roguelike spin-off it inspired in the first place, Dead Cells. We have forgotten Atari 2600 shooter Yars’ Revenge serving as the inspiration for a 2D metroidvania reboot in Yars Rising. And we even have the absolutely delightful shmuptroidvania Minishoot’ Adventures that basically crosses The Legend of Zelda with Galaga. If you want to play a metroidvania, you no longer have to dig in the past. I know, ironic – because that’s what this very column is about.</p><div id="tier-list-rank-the-heirs-to-the-metroidvania-empire" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tier List: Rank the Heirs to the Metroidvania Empire</h3><h3>Tier List: Rank the Heirs to the Metroidvania Empire</h3></p></div><p>But I’m greedy, so I asked Donald Mustard  if he would come back to work on a game like Shadow Complex – or if he was ready to deputize someone else out there who could carry on the legacy and continue the series.</p><p>“The opportunity to become a partner at AGBO with Joe and Anthony Russo and the absolutely incredible team that has assembled there is a dream come true for me. We are creating some truly incredible stories that will allow us to push storytelling further across different mediums. I can’t wait for people to experience some of these things,” he said. </p><p>“But that ‘possible exception’ I mentioned? If I was to ever direct another video game someday, it would absolutely be a game like Shadow Complex.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"If I was to ever direct another video game someday, it would absolutely be a game like Shadow Complex.” - Donald Mustard</p></div><h2>Where Can You Play it Now</h2><p>Shadow Complex wasn’t entirely forgotten after ChAIR turned to Infinity Blade. The developer brought back a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-complex-remastered">Remaster of Shadow Complex</a> for an encore outing in 2015 for PC, with a console release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the following year. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>If there is a silver lining in the story of a potential game series cut short, it’s that Shadow Complex is easy to track down – and it still holds up well in both editions. The Remaster is available for $15 on the Epic Games Store and Steam and the PlayStation and Xbox Stores. Annoyingly, the original Xbox 360 game sells for the same price. If you want to splurge, there’s even a small physical release of 7,500 PS4 copies of the Remastered version, courtesy of Limited Run, which unfortunuately now commands upwards of $100 on eBay. The remaster is definitely the version to play – and I highly recommend going back to it if you’re a fan of metroidvanias in general. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeerIGN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peer Schneider</a><em> heads up Game Help &amp; Tools across IGN, Map Genie, Eurogamer, RockPaperShotgun, and VG247 and would love to fill a pool with metroidvanias and go swimming in it. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the VCT 2025 season just beyond the horizon, many esports teams are preparing their Valorant rosters. With teams like Sentinels and NRG already revealing their teams, many other organizations are scurrying to get their rosters announced. Among these teams is T1, who recently began revealing their 2025 Valorant roster for the upcoming VCT season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-t1-begins-announcing-vct-2025-roster">T1 Begins Announcing VCT 2025 Roster</h2>



<p>With the 2024 season wrapping up just over a month ago, many Valorant vans are itching for more action. Luckily, with only a few months left in the year, we should all be getting our Valorant fix very shortly. </p>



<p>And now, we are learning just who will be playing for what teams during the 2025 VCT season. </p>



<p>T1, who has had a rough history within the Valorant scene, is looking to up their game going into 2025. With their last first-place being back in 2022 at the NSG: Summer Championship – Open 2 event, the team is looking for a hail mary going into 2025. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Well, it looks like the team’s roster for next year’s season is stacked, as the esports organization has slowly been announcing everyone on Twitter over the last week.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-full-t1-2025-valorant-roster">Full T1 2025 Valorant Roster</h3>



<p>With some of the top South Korean Valorant players announced for T1’s newest roster, fans are getting amped up to see how the team performs in the 2025 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>T1 2025 Roster:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Meteor (Player)</li>



<li>Sylvan (Player)</li>



<li>Indigo (Coach)</li>



<li>CheongGak (Coach)</li>
</ul>



<p>As of now, this is all we know, but the team continues to update their Twitter almost daily with new announcements. By the end of next week, we should have the entire team revealed. It seems, though, as if T1 is preparing to go all out for 2025.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles is a new game mode where players can explore some never-before-seen storylines for their favourite characters. These storylines vastly differ from the events in the anime or manga. In this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guide, we will go through all the different branching storylines and alternate endings for Gohan in the Buu Saga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles feature two types of branches; some are complete storylines, whereas others are alternate endings. Completing a whole storyline rewards you with 100,000 Zeni, a bunch of XP and some items. This guide explains all you need to know about Gohan’s branching storylines in the Buu Saga and how to unlock them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-a-dependable-son">A Dependable Son</h2>



<p>In Gohan’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode battles, players are offered a choice at the beginning of the Buu Saga. The choice is offered when Spopovich is battering Videl, and Gohan has to either choose to ‘Stay Calm’ or ‘Step in’ to protect. However, no matter your decision, the game mode will follow the canon storyline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real choice arrives when Gohan battles Dabura in the Majin Buu arc. Leading up to this fight, Gohan is constantly reminded how far back he has fallen. Vegeta also says that he could knock Gohan out in his sleep. Eager to prove his worth, Gohan takes on Dabura alone. You must defeat Dabura before the match ends to trigger A Dependable Son ending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you manage to trigger it, Gohan unleashes his true power and defeats Dabura. Left with no allies, Babidi is defeated, and Buu is never revived. The Z Warriors can go about their lives peacefully. However, Goku wants to go a few rounds against Gohan to test his strength.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-stronger-than-the-strongest">Stronger than the Strongest</h2>



<p>This is another alternate Buu Saga ending for Gohan in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles. The Stronger than the Strongest path for Gohan can be unlocked during the Lust for Power mission. Buu has absorbed Gotenks in this battle and shifted his focus to Gohan. You must defeat Buu before the time ends to unlock the secret ending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new scenario, Buu loses power once Gotenks’ fusion wears off and now seeks to absorb Gohan. Gohan is weary of Buu’s tactics and avoids being absorbed. He then fights with his whole strength and defeats Buu, restoring peace on Earth. In this scenario, Goku and Vegeta do not need to intervene, and we do not see the Vegito fusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles is a new story mode in which players can experience the iconic moments of the anime and explore some never-before-seen storylines. In this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guide, we will discuss all the different branching storylines and alternate endings for Gohan in the Cell Saga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that there are two types of branches in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles; some are complete storylines, whereas others are just alternate endings. Completing an entire storyline rewards you with 100,000 Zeni, a bunch of XP and some items.

<h2 id="h-peace-reclaimed">Peace Reclaimed</h2>



<p>In the Cell Saga, Gohan’s Episode Battles only have one alternate ending, which players can unlock during the Unleased Rage mission. Players will need to defeat Cell quickly to trigger the Peace Reclaimed ending. To know if you’ve triggered this ending, pay attention to Cell’s Dialogue during battles; they will change if Gohan is quick enough while inflicting damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you pull it off, Gohan will enter a frenzy after seeing Cell Jr hurt his loved ones. He instantly vaporises Cell Jr. and then goes after Cell. This time, Gohan doesn’t let his guard down and finishes Cell before he can pull any dirty tricks. This means Goku doesn’t have to die, and the Father and Son can return home peacefully.&nbsp;</p>

Check out this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles guide to learn how to unlock the Gohan Black storyline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that to unlock this branching storyline for Gohan in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, they must complete a specific task during one of the battles. Also, some Alternative Paths have Sparking! Episodes, which are original cutscenes created for the new moments, and there are plenty of these for Gohan Black.

<h2 id="h-is-gohan-black-playable-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Is Gohan Black Playable in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero?</h2>



<p>The answer to this question is no, Gohan Black is not a playable character in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. However, you battle this character several times during Gohan’s alternate storyline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-strongest-warrior-nbsp">The Strongest Warrior&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Gohan’s alternate path in the Super Saga is unlockable when you must defend the Earth from the Frieza Force. During this mission, players must beat the Frieza Soldier quickly and then corner Frieza. You must pummel Frieza with a flurry of attacks until he acknowledges Gohan’s fighting potential.</p>



<p>If Frieza acknowledges Gohan, the Strongest Warrior path will be unlocked, and there will be a new Sparking! Episode plays. In this episode, Gohan’s battle instincts kick in, and his Potential is unlocked again. At the same time, Frieza chooses to showcase his Golden Form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you defeat Frieza here, Goku and Vegeta will never arrive on Earth to save the day. However, Gohan still feels he has become weak over the years and asks Piccolo to train him. He also visits the Land of the Kai’s to have Kais train his other abilities.</p>

<h2 id="h-gohan-s-growth-nbsp">Gohan’s Growth&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Due to this training, Gohan is strong enough to participate in the Universe 6 vs Universe 7 tournament, where his matchup is against the Legendary Hitman, Hit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The battle between the two juggernauts, Hit and Gohan, becomes a sensation across the other Universes, with many Supreme Kais gaining interest in Gohan. Even Vegeta acknowledges Gohan’s power jump after seeing his performance in the Tournament.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-a-change-in-timeline-nbsp">A Change in Timeline&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Due to Gohan’s growth, the timeline changes even further. In this new timeline, Future Trunks returns to Earth and meets Gohan instead of Goku, like in the canon series of events. This is when a new Sparking Episode plays.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-here-comes-black-gohan">Here Comes Black Gohan</h2>



<p>The new Sparking Episode starts with one of the most hype scenes in the game. Black Gohan has arrived in pursuit of Future Trunks and is now facing Gohan. You must fight Black Gohan until he is warped back to his timeline to complete this mission. Black Gohan has taken Black Goku’s place in this branching path and has brought Future Trunks’ timeline to the brink of destruction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following events of this timeline are similar to those in the canon, except Gohan has replaced Goku as the protagonist. In this branching path, Gohan, Vegeta and Goku travel to the future to confront Black Gohan with Future Trunks. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-training-with-piccolo-nbsp">Training with Piccolo&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Gohan is overwhelmed by Zamasu and Black Gohan’s strength and returns to the present time just like canon events. However, this time, Piccolo teaches Gohan the Evil Containment Wave while motivating him to save the future timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trio returns to the future as they face Zamasu and Black Gohan. Fused Zamasu is created as the father-son combinations (Goku/Gohan and Vegeta/Trunks) give it all to battle against this immortal enemy. You must bring Fused Zamasu’s health down until the match ends during this scenario.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-sons-take-up-the-mantle-nbsp">The Sons Take up the Mantle&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Zamasu’s body starts disintegrating, and he is hit with a Father-Son Kamehameha. Goku and Vegeta get gassed out after this attack, and it is now up to the sons, Trunks and Gohan, to finish the job. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You battle Fused Zamasu one last time, and that’s the last fight on this branching path. A new Sparking! Episode plays where Gohan and Trunks use a Dual Masenko to stagger Fused Zamasu. Then Gohan uses the Evil Containment Wave to finish the job, as there’s no Zeno to save the day this time.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-is-the-rare-fantasy-game-that-goes-beyond-racism-101.1008204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I no longer expect video games that tackle the subjects of racism and discrimination through fantasy — as <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> does — to surprise me. Those stories never go beyond well-trodden depictions of “racism is bad,” and I tune them out like so much white noise. But <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has done the work, and its willingness to go beyond surface-level treatments of tired fantasy tropes to dig at the heart of the real issues with racism and discrimination is exactly what makes it a phenomenal game. <em>Metaphor</em> is a clever evolution of the <em>Persona</em> series, but it wouldn’t be as interesting or outstanding as it is without its refreshingly progressive message.</p><p><em>Metaphor </em>takes place in a world where our reality of “equality” between different ethnic groups is presented as an unattainable-but-nice-to-think-about idyllic fantasy, while discrimination, classism, and the struggle against monstrous creatures called “humans” rule the day.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>In </em>Metaphor<em>, society is arranged into a racial hierarchy based on different fantastical physical features... or lack thereof.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>The world of <em>Metaphor</em> is stratified according to a hierarchy of different tribes classified by their physical characteristics, like wings, horns, or elfin-like long ears. Then there’s the protagonist, who comes from the most hated tribe, which, to our eyes, resemble real-world humans with no distinct physical features. Atlus calling this game “Metaphor” is about as unsubtle as a brick thrown at a protest.</p><div><p>As I dive into the guts of what makes <em>Metaphor</em> so great, I do have to note the frequent issues I had with instability. I played the game on Xbox Series S and experienced numerous crashes that seemed related to the game’s autosave feature. On top of that, when the game did crash and I rebooted my Xbox to start over, the game frequently reloaded without a video input. I could hear the start menu music but see nothing, requiring me to end my gaming sessions prematurely as the issue only seemed to fix itself after an overnight break. You can read more about <em>Metaphor</em>’s technical performance <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metaphor-refantazio-a-sublime-game-let-down-by-bizarre-technical-choices">in <em>Eurogamer</em>’s review</a>.</p></div><p>The world is thrown into chaos when the dogmatic king is murdered, leaving behind no heir, as his idealistic son mysteriously vanished years before. His death triggers a nationwide contest whereby anyone, no matter their birth or circumstance, can compete to win the throne, provided they have the love and support of the people. Your job is to earn that love through a variety of contests in the hope of putting that idealistic prince on the throne so that he may change this hateful racist world for the better.</p><p>In <em>Metaphor</em>, the characters utilize a job class system called archetypes. Each party member starts with a specific archetype — warrior, healer, mage, etc. — and by developing relationships with other NPCs, unlock more. Like <em>Persona</em>, combat is centered on exploiting an enemy’s weakness while mitigating your own. There’s also an absolutely fabulous overworld combat feature where if you strike a weaker enemy, they simply die, forgoing a transition into a battle scene. However, if an enemy is your level or stronger, you can use overworld combat to surprise attack and weaken them, giving you a serious advantage in the fight to come.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The slick menus of </em>Persona-<em>series fame return.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>I adore these improvements over <em>Persona</em>’s combat because it significantly cuts down on the time needed to grind experience. It also makes combat <em>harrowing as hell</em> because while you’re able to ambush monsters, they can do the same to you. <em>Metaphor</em>’s combat excels, exceeding its RPG cohort, because it demands that I think more strategically. Arrogantly running around a dungeon or into boss fights with your biggest, highest-level guns blazing is not always the winning strategy, and it’s also a good way to get you killed.</p><p>My higher-level party was frequently wiped out by an enemy I’d otherwise mop the floor with simply because they got the drop on me. Conversely, I’ve been able to soundly defeat enemies eight and nine levels higher than me with freshly unlocked level-one archetypes because their special abilities were uniquely suited to exploit a weakness. <em>Metaphor</em> is the only single-player game that made me feel like a raid leader in an MMO like <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>or <em>World of Warcraft</em>.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em> also feels good from a tactile perspective. The animations that play as you fluidly zip between different options in combat add a kinetic energy that made me feel like I was playing an action game instead of a turn-based RPG. This experience is enhanced by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design">the slick-as-hell, highly stylized menus</a> and the <em>killer</em> soundtrack — especially the main battle music. I don’t know what that man is saying, but the way he says it gets me hype as hell.</p><p>But <em>Metaphor</em> is more than just a stylish, dynamic RPG — it’s also the rare fantasy story that tackles discrimination with nuance.</p><p>In a lot of fantasy, I’m annoyed by the storytelling conceit of using discrimination against fantasy races as an allegory for real-world racism. Stories featuring this trope usually stop at the “racism is bad” surface level, demonstrating that with ugly over-the-top displays of violence (hey there, <em>Dragon Age</em>) while ignoring the subtleties that make racism so heinous and pervasive. <em>Metaphor </em>manages to incorporate and tackle both aspects of this reality.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>“Rich people are corrupt” is a sentiment frequently expressed in video games but rarely so... pointedly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>There’s a moment when you’re reading a fantasy book with a companion, and they mention that realizing their goal of a world where everyone is treated equally won’t be enough. “Equal competition doesn’t mean equal footing,” Heismay says. It’s the first time I’ve seen a video game acknowledge that simply stopping the big bad evil racist won’t magically make up for the countless generations of oppression. The game does the same with class and wealth. There’s a character vying for the throne who wishes to essentially “eat the rich” and redistribute their wealth at the point of a guillotine. But by virtue of her extremely low status, she sees everybody with more than a few coins to rub together as her ideological enemy. It’s just like when people in poverty lash out at other people a little bit less in poverty when their real enemies are the wealthy powerholders who exploit that animosity. It’s awesome that the game calls that out.</p><p>There’s an almost reflexive instinct to call <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> “<em>Persona</em> with swords.” The game has the hallmarks of a <em>Persona,</em> which lend it an air of familiarity, not to mention <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262346/metaphor-refantazio-katsura-hashino-interview-persona">much of the same creative talent</a>. But this characterization doesn’t feel correct. Those familiar systems have been remixed to feel fresh while the game’s message is vibrating on levels the <em>Persona</em> games brush up against but never quite reach.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Heismay says, “Diversity, equality, </em>and<em> inclusion.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>The upsetting thing about racism, classism, homophobia, and the like is that there’s a reluctance in the real world to acknowledge that it’s not only the violence of individual actors that perpetuates this oppression but institutions and systems as well. We challenge those individual actors and call them out because that’s much easier and quicker to do than the difficult generational work it takes to dismantle racist systems and build equitable ones. Games with that kind of message do the same — ending with the climactic defeat of the bad guys. <em>Metaphor</em> is one of the first times a high-profile game acknowledges the real, much harder, and less glamorous work of dismantling systems.</p><p>And at a time when you can’t even call out the individual actors anymore without getting gaslit to hell and back — it’s moving, as a person of color, to see <em>Metaphor</em> go the extra mile to say, “These systems need to go, too.” That’s what makes <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> so powerful, resonant, and in every sense of a word that’s unfortunately been bastardized into meaninglessness, woke as fuck.</p><p><small><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Also, The Weather Channel used its Unreal-powered storm visualization tool to give viewers a good look at just how bad the devastation from Hurricane Milton could have been in the lead-up to the storm’s arrival in Florida, and the results were incredibly effective. </p><p>In more traditional gaming news, the folks behind <em>Halo </em>announced a rebrand from 343 Industries to Halo Studios, and also revealed that they were moving from the proprietary tools known as Slipstream to Unreal. We’ve got an early glimpse at both Master Chief and the signature <em>Halo </em>landscape as they look in the popular engine. Nintendo, meanwhile, no doubt aware that millions of fans are awaiting any details on the successor to the Switch with bated breath, took the opportunity to announce...an alarm clock! It’s a distinctly Nintendo move, and one that generated no shortage of hilarious and exasperated reactions from across the interweb. We rounded up some of the best. </p><p>All these stories and more await in the pages ahead.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c385623d3412a99ada1c37b15270bbe" data-recommend-id="image://0c385623d3412a99ada1c37b15270bbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="0c385623d3412a99ada1c37b15270bbe" data-recommend-id="image://0c385623d3412a99ada1c37b15270bbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Popular YouTuber and Kick streamer Jack Doherty made news over the weekend after he crashed his pricey sports car into a guardrail.

The legendary game director, who is responsible for the modern Persona games and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">more recently Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, believes that, in a world obsessed with pixel count and frame-rates, only one thing matters: the people who made it. </p><p>“I want something – even if it’s not complete, even if it’s really rough, even if it’s something really unfinished – to give me a glimpse of the humanity behind it. [I want to know] who created it and for it to give me a glimpse of the emotion that inspired it,” he explains.</p><p>It’s a philosophy that has served him well over the past 30 years and it’s one of the reasons the Persona games have such a devout following. Yes, the art direction is impeccable, as is the attention to detail, even down to the UI, but it’s the characters who populate this fantastical series that really make a difference. Chie, Junpei, Ann… They all feel like real people, with traits and emotions we can relate to, so much so they feel like old friends rather than characters from a video game. That’s entirely intentional and it’s what drives Hashino to make games – a personal approach that runs counter to some of the bigger projects out there that are required to meet the expectations of both fans and company shareholders alike.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want something – even if it’s not complete, even if it’s really rough, even if it’s something really unfinished – to give me a glimpse of the humanity behind it.</p></div><p>Hashino is a longtime director at Atlus, having worked on several of the company’s Shin Megami Tensei games, the much-loved RPG series that merges the occult with more grounded settings. In a world dominated by ‘traditional’ Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, they’re a sort of goth alternative that has steadily grown in popularity over the years. </p><p>He took over the Persona series starting with Persona 3, following the departure of the previous Persona director Kouji Okada. Hashino brought over some of the darker themes from Shin Megami Tensei and mixed them with Persona’s more stylish pop vibe, resulting in a vibrant anime-influenced aesthetic, set against a high school backdrop that grappled with mythic ideas like gods and demons, as well as psychology. It’s a series that has established Hashino as one of gaming’s most respected directors. On the eve of his latest game, Metaphor: ReFantazio, IGN sat down with Hashino to look back at his past work and what drives him to make games. </p><p>Persona 3 catapulted the series into mass popularity and coincided with a renewed interest in anime in North America. However, despite its cartoon visuals there’s a lot of depth to the game and, importantly, the characters, as Hashino explains: “I think the gap between the kind of realism of the characters themselves and the anime aesthetic is a really interesting and important part of the game. You might first look and see these very anime-style characters and this anime-style world, but then might be surprised and interested to see there’s a very real [world] underpinning to them. Looking beyond the anime and seeing the realism is really a wonderful part of our games.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I feel like if you have these super highly polished games that look like they were designed by a bunch of people in a CEO boardroom, that doesn’t really excited me</p></div><p>This realism – the effort Hashino and his team goes to, to ensure every character feels real – is what drives every decision in the design process, from broad ideas to specific dialogue, as Hasino explains: “There’s this little girl named Nanako [in Persona 4] who’s in elementary school. When we were first writing her dialogue, we wrote [it] to be really, really cute. But then we took a step back and thought, ‘Wait a minute, all of her lines are so cute and they’re so well done that it doesn’t feel like any actual human girl would [talk like that] at that age’. It just felt like too much.”</p><p>Rather than lean into the fact Nanako is a video game character and thus might have dialogue that doesn’t sound truly authentic, Hashino and his team went back to the writers’ room. “We started cutting back on those overly cutesy dialogues and tried to root it in reality instead. So even though Persona 4 is a modern fantasy game, we wanted it to feel closer to something that could be happening next door to you.”</p><p>One thing that becomes clear when speaking with Hashino is the love he has for the well-being of the characters in his games. When discussing his favorite moment in Persona 5, he tells us it’s when the cast of characters are able to hang out in the retro-style cafe in Shibuya that the Phantom Thieves make their hideout.</p><p>“In Persona 5, a lot of the characters don’t really have a place where they feel safe,” Hashino explains. “So I wanted to find a place where they can go and just really have that sense of security. And in Shibuya [a neighborhood in Tokyo] it’s really hard to find that location. There’s lots of roads, lots of corridors, but there’s not really a place where [you think], ‘Okay, you guys can just sit here and chill out and just use it as your base’. Finding a place [where] they’d be welcome is really difficult. So for the characters in Persona 5, I was trying to give them a place where they <em>would</em> be welcome. That’s when I came up with the idea of what we call in Japan a <em>junkissa</em>, which is an old-style cafe.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Hashino’s love for the characters he creates is something that’s echoed by fans, and even though Metaphor: ReFantazio steps away from the familiar Persona setting – it’s set in a new, fantasy world rather than Tokyo – it has a lot in common with the games he’s made before. Similarly, the characters you’ll meet in Metaphor, despite being different from the Phantom Thieves we’re familiar with, are faced with many of the same emotional pressures such as prejudice, fear, and anxiety.</p><p>“Metaphor is a game where the characters are around teenage age, but they’re not facing [traditional] teenager problems,” Hashino says, inferring that the characters you meet will struggle with a lot more than typical teen drama like peer pressure and romance. “They’re facing anxiety and all these other big things that affect everybody, no matter who they are, where they are, or how old they are.” So while Metaphor: ReFantazio presents a new world with new characters, many of its themes can be found in Hashino’s other games.</p><p>Indeed, whether it’s Persona, Shin Megami Tensei or Metaphor, getting under the skin of each character is core to the experience. It’s something Hashino believes comes from the people who make the games, and that he prefers projects in which you can see a developer’s true self: “I feel like if you have these super highly polished games that look like they were designed by a bunch of people in a CEO boardroom, that doesn’t really excited me — it doesn’t really interest me”, he admits, bluntly. “But when I see these sorts of games [which reveal a little about the people that made them], it really fills me with the motivation to keep developing,” he says. “That these artists, these creatives, had something they really wanted to say is where I get all of my inspiration from, and the drive to continue to be creative myself.”</p><p><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

The minute-long video is just as sphincter clenching as you’d expect. It shows the Cybertruck rolling out to the Terminator theme music. For some reason there’s smoke for the Cybertruck to drive through  before the truck stops and is joined by Irvine Police officers who awkwardly pose with the truck, complete with cyborg-like smiles. The video ends with custom thunder and lightning graphics created for the truck that reads “Irvine Police Cybertruck.” I guess we’re all supposed to go “hell yeah!” at that point.<br></p><p>Irvine Police are doubling down on the department’s reasoning for spending well over six figures on this electric pickup.

And not everyone is buying the department’s reasoning that the truck is for community engagement. Some experts believe the money spent on the Cybertruck and its law enforcement modifications should have been actually spent on, you know, the community. </p><p>The truck being a part of the DARE program doesn’t help things either. As Gizmodo pointed out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03346-017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03346-017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have shown</a></span> the program does not work. It also doesn’t look as if Irvine PD actually got proper licensing to use “The Terminator” music in the video; the department mentioned in a statement to Gizmodo that “The video was used on our socials and music credit was given to the artist.” Between the public backlash, this cringe video and a possible copyright violation, it looks like this Cybertruck is already turning out to be less of a plus for the department and more of a headache. <br></p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Jalopnik, our sister site, on Wednesday, October 9.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The film made a multiple of 56 times on its $4.5 million budget and was less a breakthrough and more of a victory lap for Blumhouse, the studio that had for nearly two decades championed scary movies at a low cost with hopes of a high return.</p><p>Partly, <em>Get Out</em> was exceptional — not the first movie where the true horror is racism, but one that balanced the terror with humor and absurdity. Eager to repeat that success, Hollywood greenlit a swath of horror movies about racism. Many of them were underwhelming and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/antebellum-movie-review-i-am-tired-of-films-like-this.html">appalling</a>.

The movie’s haunting atmosphere and gorgeous cinematography make it seem primed to tap into Hollywood’s current obsession with unsettling features running on spooky vibes alone. But for all of its hype and a solid performance from its leads, <em>Cuckoo</em> suffers from a lack of thematic coherence. It’s definitely the strongest of Neon’s recent scary movies, but that isn’t exactly a high bar to clear.</p><p>Set in a corner of the German Alps where few foreigners tend to wander, <em>Cuckoo</em> follows as sullen, American teenager Gretchen (Hunter Schafer) is forced to move in with her estranged father, Luis (Marton Csokas), and his new family. With all of Gretchen’s beloved bandmates and treasured possessions back in the States, she can’t help but feel alone living with her stepmother Beth (Jessica Henwick) and mute half-sister Alma (Mila Lieu).

Since 2020, the writer and director has been fully immersed in the genre-spanning franchise that started with the ’70s slasher flick <em>X</em> and continued with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23352979/pearl-review-tiff-2022">the technicolor prequel <em>Pearl</em></a>, which were filmed back-to-back in New Zealand during the pandemic and released in 2022. Now things culminate with the premiere of the series’ third act, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24124163/maxxxine-trailer-release-date-a24-mia-goth">the very ’80s thriller <em>MaXXXine</em></a>. It’s been an intense process that has meant West hasn’t had much time for anything else. “It’s all such a blur at this point,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It’s been seven days a week, 12 hours a day, for four and a half years.”</p><p>The franchise was born, in part, out of practicality. West had initially only pitched <em>X</em> to the powers that be at A24 but had ideas for a bigger trilogy in the back of his mind. And after getting a cast and crew to New Zealand and building the sets, he realized he could film a lot of that work again for a prequel. “We had already spent all of this time and money building a Texas farm in New Zealand. How do we reuse it for free?” he remembers thinking. “How do we amortize all of those costs and make the movie less of a risk for A24? That’s where the idea came from from a practical standpoint.” He ended up writing the script for <em>Pearl</em> in a two-week-long flurry while in quarantine so that they could start shooting right away.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190083/ti-west-interview-maxxxine-a24">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-3cd8d11b-4330-4052-a2a9-483085c52be9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159054/i-saw-the-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">For the director of I Saw the TV Glow, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was just the start</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Monica Schipper / Getty Images for IMDb</cite></p></figure></div><p>There is an honesty to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>’</a>s depiction of growing up as a lonely, fantasy-obsessed kid in the ’90s that makes it resonate. And that’s true regardless of whether you, like writer / director Jane Schoenbrun, were a fan of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>.</p><p>The film’s mind-bending story centers on Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine). The two outsiders spark an unlikely friendship over their shared love of <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, a fictional fantasy / horror series that feels like a twisted mashup of <em>The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete </em>and <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark? </em>Between its angsty, lo-fi atmosphere and pivots into explicit B-movie horror, almost every frame speaks to how large an impact <em>Buffy</em> had on Schoenbrun’s young imagination. But you can also hear Schoenbrun <a href="https://www.queergeektheory.org/2009/04/eve-kosofsky-sedgwick-1950-2009/">channeling the ideas</a> of queer theorists like <a href="https://queertheoryvisualculture.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sedgwick_queerperformativity.pdf">Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick</a> as the film explores what it really means to see one’s self in fiction.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159054/i-saw-the-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-02b82cbb-6a99-4dc5-9a47-27fdc5ff2b31"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc">Hellblade II’s stunning world is alive with horror</a></h2><p>Traversing the nightmare realms of the human mind has always been central to horror. The stories we tell ourselves about what’s moving in the darkness, the creation of monsters out of unknown sounds — from this emerges our fascination with terror. In <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, players navigate a cold, dark ninth-century Iceland in the often wet shoes of the Pictish warrior Senua on her second adventure in the third-person action-horror franchise. I was very fond of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">the first <em>Hellblade</em></a>, which saw Senua journey into Hel to save the soul of her lover. But the sequel pulled me in even further, with some of the most unforgettable and unsettling psychological horror I’ve ever experienced.</p><p>Senua, who lives with psychosis that causes her to hear constant voices, is a fierce warrior who has “killed” gods before in her personal quests at redemption. Cast out by her people in the Orkney Islands for being different, or a “witch,” she has taken her battles across the sea to rescue her people from slavers.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-6bbb6b61-13b0-46e0-936e-5bfa71151366"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">Crow Country is a gloriously grimy revival of ’90s survival horror</a></h2><p>Even as modern horror games become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">unnervingly immersive</a>, there’s still a place for the particular mood of old-school survival horror. Through a combo of grimy visuals, cryptic puzzles, slow pacing, and clunky controls, PlayStation-era games like <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em> were able to create a distinct kind of tension and terror. <em>Crow Country</em> is what would happen if that kind of game never went out of style. It has the look and feel of the classics but with just the right amount of modern flourish. It’s a perfect bite of classic horror.</p><p><em>Crow Country</em> comes from indie studio SFB Games — led by brothers Tom and Adam Vian — which has so far managed to create quite the eclectic library of releases. There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16633946/snipperclips-plus-nintendo-switch-interview">the playful Switch launch title <em>Snipperclips</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20917268/apple-arcade-tangle-tower-localization-translation">the point-and-click murder mystery <em>Tangle Tower</em></a>, and now a dark survival horror game. <em>Crow Country</em> doesn’t just evoke the <strong>’</strong>90s&nbsp;— it’s set during the period as well. The entire game takes place in an abandoned Atlanta amusement park in 1990, as a woman named Mara sets out in search of the park’s elusive owner who mysteriously disappeared. Of course, the place is teeming with monsters and mystery.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-a61f2bbf-e1b8-49ed-941b-676f935ec39b"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24">I Saw the TV Glow is a tribute to the transformative power of fandom</a></h2><p>Discovering and latching on to pieces of art that touch you in profound, formative ways is a beautiful part of growing up in a world that’s so thoroughly saturated with mass media.

Whereas <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair </em>was a snapshot of life in the age of modern social media, <em>I Saw the TV Glow </em>is an exploration of what it felt like to be an outcast teenager in the ’90s — a time when young fans of sci-fi and fantasy often had to find each other by chance.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-92f9809c-0bd9-40a4-a952-2d1b99dd0165"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/20/24135658/late-night-with-the-devil-horror-movie-shudder">The self-possessed horrors of Late Night with the Devil</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Courtesy of IFC Films and Shudder</cite></p></figure></div><p>Horror films live and die by their conceits.

David Dastmalchian, a character actor who you’ll recognize from the margins of half a dozen Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve movies, gets a rare star turn as Jack Delroy, the host of late-night talk show <em>Night Owls</em>. But in an era where Johnny Carson rules after-hours broadcast, Delroy’s second-place program is on the verge of getting canceled.

By the time I was old enough to appreciate “Back to the Future,” its cultural impact had dissipated. Had I been born 20 years earlier, I would have been 16 when it came out, and I’d probably understand the attachment people have to a prop made out of a shitty car, but whether it’s age or something else, I just don’t get it. </p><p>The thing is, though, I don’t think it’s specifically a “Back to the Future” thing. I just don’t see any point in owning something that’s so obviously a movie prop. Want to build a replica of the black Toyota SR5 from the same series? Go for it. In fact, I even understand paying a little extra for a truck with the right BTTF<em> </em>look. It’s a subtle nod to those who know, but to everyone else, you’re just driving around in a cool, old pickup truck. </p><p>A DMC-12 that’s been given the time machine treatment, on the other hand, is only cool to people who are big fans of a move that’s nearly 40 years old. If you took it to a convention or something, I could see the appeal there, but for use outside of that? You’re just driving around in an obvious movie prop, and it comes off like you desperately want people to talk to you about your car. For less than $10,000, I could maybe understand, but these things go for real money! There are five days left on the auction, and as previously mentioned, it’s already been bid up to $35,000. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this thing ends up going for more than I make in a year.</p><p>The real questions here are “To whom?” and “Why?” And while it probably sounds like I’m being snarky here, I promise I genuinely want to understand. What is the appeal of these cars? Are Gen X-ers realizing 65 is creeping up on them quickly and desperately trying to relive their youth? Please tell me what I’m missing because, clearly, I’m missing something here.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Jalopnik, our sister site, on Friday, October 11.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
