		<p>Nintendo Switch Sports is getting a free update with a whole new sport: basketball! Announced during today’s Nintendo Direct, the ball-bouncing, hoop-shooting action will be added to the game this Summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024 – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kX3BkD5PVUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Basketball will allow you to play by dribbling, passing and shooting in a handful of different modes. There’s team ups in 2v2 matches, there’s group free throws, and more, with both local and online multiplayer.</p>
<p>Switch Sports came out in 2022, with Jason saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/04/nintendo-switch-sports-review-wii-sports/">our review</a>, “Nintendo Switch Sports is a fun reminder of the Wii Sports craze, bringing back some classic sports and adding some new ones that make use of the Joy-Con and motion controls in more advanced ways. It’s all just a bit shallow, though, and difficult to wholeheartedly recommend unless you expect to play online a lot or constantly break it out for local head-to-head battles.”</p>

		<p>Nintendo announced a brand new Mario &amp; Luigi RPG, with Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership coming to Nintendo Switch on 7th November 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5I3DcapElQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Now on Nintendo Switch, Mario &amp; Luigi comes with a totally new art style for the franchise, which originally debuted on the Game Boy Advance and became a 3DS mainstay with remakes in the latter years of the handheld. THere’s much more of a cel shaded style to the visual style, embracing all the bombast that 3D graphics and more cartoony animation can deliver to crazy combo attacks between the brothers, with combat looking to lean heavily on the series’ traditional style.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-2024-core-rulebook-pre-order-bonuses-sub-classes-and-dm-assistance-detailed.904368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-core-rulebook-pre-order-bonuses-sub-classes-and-dm-assistance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Core Rulebook update is just around the corner and last week we got to sit down with Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins to hear about everything that fans of the game have to look forward to.</p>
<p>2024 marks the 50th Anniversary of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. As part of the celebration, a Level 10-20 adventure has already been released in the form of Vecna: Eve of Ruin, and a book detailing The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<h2>2024 Core Rulebook Release Schedule and Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>
<p>The release schedule of each of the 2024 Core Rulebooks are:</p>
<ul><li>Player Hand Book will be released September 17th, 2024</li>
<li>Dungeon Masters Guide will be released&nbsp;November 11th, 2024</li>
<li>Monster Manual will be released Feb 18th, 2024</li>
</ul><p>Pre-Order Bonuses include a 40th Anniversary Gold Dragon Mini for the upcoming Virtual Tabletop version of D&amp;DBeyond, a Dragons of D&amp;D Digital Art Book, and a D&amp;D Beyond Gold Dice Set.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playing-the-game.jpg?itok=H1fOcaak 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playing-the-game.jpg?itok=PfRncAGm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chapter 1 now starts a player off on how to play the game, instead of other info about the universe</figcaption></figure><p>Chris Perkins, Creative Director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Jeremy Crawford, Game Director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, next spoke about their aims for the 2024 Core Rulebook set explaining that their intention was to review everything released and to create a 'best' version for what is also the 10th anniversary of 5th Edition.</p>
<p>Perkins added that it was a good opportunity to get the group together that originally worked on the creation of 5th edition to 'take another whirl at it and give them the glow up that they deserve."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the keys to 5th editions success is that it was built in communication with our fans. It strives to take the best of D&amp;D over all editions, but created in consultation with our dedicated community of D&amp;D players and DMs" - Perkins</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Players Handbook 2024</h2>
<p>Starting with the Players Handbook we were re-introduced to the different covers;&nbsp;Standard Cover art by Tyler Jacobson, and the&nbsp;Alternate Cover artwork by Wylie Beckert. The alternate art&nbsp;cover will only be available in-game stores, and will be available 2 weeks prior to release dates</p>

<p>When deciding on the artwork for the 2024 covers it was explained that&nbsp;it was important to have a dragon on the cover. When looking over the range of dragons they settled on a gold dragon. This is the Gold anniversary of D&amp;D afterall.</p>
<p>The PHB has been rebuilt to bring new game options to players, but to also provide a better starting experience for those new to D&amp;D. A new Starter Set was teased to be in the work, but for all of the new players that begin with the PHB it was important that that was something they considered.</p>
<h2>Learning Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a new player in 2024</h2>
<p>The PHB starts with Chapter 1 teaching you how to play the game now, traditionally it started with creating a character. "Before you get to all the fun details of fleshing out your character [...] you could have some firm ground under your feet for how to play" Crawford explained. All of the game's basic rules have been condensed into this first chapter helping players use it as a resource while playing.</p>
<p>A rules glossary has also been added to the game that will help players quickly lookup rules. This rules glossary contains rules for the whole game, not just player-related rules. Crawford commended that this will likely be the most used part of these books.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/combat-example.jpg?itok=TZsyA7zB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/combat-example.jpg?itok=BGv43JIg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A combat example shows new players what to expect going into D&amp;D Combat</figcaption></figure><p>Additional assistance is included for new players and DMs with multiple examples of played sessions including each characters voice and detailed breakouts highlighting the different rules and steps to mechanics like combat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating a character in D&amp;DBeyond a new checkbox will be made available that lets people select what ruleset they want to use</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Character Options, Classes, and Sub-Classes</h2>
<p>After teaching the players how to play the game it then moves into the different Character Classes. Additional information in here includes recommendations of Ability Scores, breakdowns of each of the subclasses, and how to make a character of every level.</p>
<p>This book contains 12 classes and 48 subclasses (15 of which are brand new for PHB, and 3 are entirely new), Crawford explained that this is the largest number they've published in a 5th-edition book. One interesting omissions from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Player Hand Book 2024 Sub-Classes by the numbers:</p>
<ul><li aria-level="1">15 are brand new for the PHB</li>
<li aria-level="1">3 entirely new sub-classes - including College of Dance Bard and Circle of the Sea Druid</li>
<li aria-level="1">16 of the returning ones are very heavily redesigned to be essentially new</li>
<li aria-level="1">Some Cleric and Wizard sub-classes are not returning as they attempted to restrict every class to four sub-classes in this book</li>
</ul><p>Every sub-class now has it's own artwork to get a feel for the subclass before you get to read them out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/character-classes.jpg?itok=MVpbjwHl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/character-classes.jpg?itok=JpObbv9A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The artificer is notably missing but the rest of the classes are a mix of new, old, and some in-between</figcaption></figure><p>The Ranger and the Monk are the two classes that Crawford stated had been remixed the most. In recent satisfaction polls the Monk had previously had the lowest level of player satisfaction, however Crawford explained that upon completing the Monk Unearthed Arcana they ended up with the highest level of satisfaction among players.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>D&amp;D 5e Class Compatability</strong><br>
Crawford did clarify that if you're using a Class that has a subclass that appears in the 2024 version you need to use that version of the subclass, if there isn't an updated version of the subclass then you should be able to use the version from pre-2024 material.</p><p>
2024 Barbarian with 2024 Path of the Berserker - Compatible<br>
2024 Barbarian with 2014 Path of the Ancestral Guardian - Compatible<br>
2024 Barbarian with 2014 Path of the Zealot - Not Compatible</p></div>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sorcerer Changes and Artwork</h2>
<p>Sorcerer artwork was shown of a tiefling crackling with innate energy, Crawford jokingly said "I want to be her when I grow up". This artwork was meant to make sure that people know that sorcerers are bursting with innate magic, a vibe that they wanted to make sure to show off.</p>
<p>Feats are going to be used to further alter how classes play. A brief example given was that all weapon-focused classes have a weapon mastery feature that will unlock 'Mastery Properties' that will give you additional weapon features and tactical choices.</p>
<p>For the Sorcerer and other spellcasters, the Spell chapter has been rebuilt from the ground up and includes 30 brand new spells, 27 redesigned spells, and 162 significantly altered spells. There are 400 spells, and over 200 of them have changes including Counter Spell.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcerer-class-opener_evyn-fong.jpg?itok=cwTawWHs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcerer-class-opener_evyn-fong.jpg?itok=lWGXbSI0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A sorcerer overflowing with power by Evyn Fong</figcaption></figure><p>After the species and class for a character has been selected it's the background that's next. In 5th edition they felt that background faded away a bit too quickly, they wanted to increase the importance so each background now also gives you a feat so that there's a mechanical difference.</p>
<p>These types of feats are called Origin feats, they're designed to be useful for your entire career. There are 75 feats that will be in the book.</p>
<p>In the final version of the book the background will list three ability scores and you can pick which gets +2/+1 or +1 across all three. This means that backgrounds will interlock with different classes in a mechanical way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/equipment.jpg?itok=o4Cq9zeG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/equipment.jpg?itok=woRQGjbE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now peruse the equipment like a shopping catalog</figcaption></figure><p>As part of the shopping experience in the new PHB the designs for the pages are meant to look like shopping manuals. You'll see pages of the different weapons, their artwork, name and pricing.</p>
<p>There is also a crafting system allowing you to make your own unique or magical items. You can create spell scrolls, different potions, and other items.</p>
<h2>Dungeon Master Guide</h2>
<p>Next to get a deep dive was the Dungeon Master Guide. We were again shown off the covers with the&nbsp;Standard Cover by Tyler Jacobson and alternate artwork by Olena Richards.</p>
<p>Perkins took over to talk about how he's a 'forever DM' and the effort that they took to create the best resource possible for DMs. The covers, of Venger and Lolth, are a focus on enemies to show how much time DMs have to think about setting up adversaries for their parties.</p>

<p>"It was important this time around" Perkins began "to make sure this rebuild DM guide is accessible to both new DMs and seasoned DMs. That it was easier to find the information, and that it becomes in effect the Dungeon Master's companion"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It shouldn't just be helpful when planning the game, but also running it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first chapter is based on "What does a DM do? What do they need? What makes them unique as a DM? What qualities do they have that can help turn them into a fabulous DM?" The second chapter is about working with your players, and the third chapter is an encyclopedia of topics including traps, hazards, environmental effects, etc.</p>
<p>The next portion of the book is about creating and running adventures as a DM.&nbsp;Included in these sections are adventure prompts. These streamlined adventures are created to help a DM create an adventure quickly when you're running your own adventures at home. There is even an example campaign setting included in the DMG, Greyhawk.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/map-of-greyhark-by-mike-schley.jpg?itok=jgrcOP4u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/map-of-greyhark-by-mike-schley.jpg?itok=sIqBDQuB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>DMs can get a sense of the Greyhawk setting with this map by Mike Schley</figcaption></figure><p>Greyhawk will also have a poster map included in the DMG, the other side will also have an isometric map of the city of Greyhawk. There is also a gazette of the continent and information on how to use the city of Greyhawk as a hub for your adventures.</p>
<p>The D&amp;D Cosmology is also detailed along with 100 pages of magic items, many of which are new. There is also a chapter on different bastions that characters can start building at level 5 (at the DMs discretion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DMG also ends with an appendix of handouts and tracking sheets for the players. These handouts include campaign expectations, travel planners, NPC trackers, DM's character tracker, and Magical item trackers. These will also be available to print from D&amp;DBeyond.</p>
<h2>Monster Manual</h2>
<p>The last book in the collection is obviously the Monster Manual. For this book&nbsp;Tyler Jacobson created the standard cover while Olena Richards created the alternate art cover again.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual will be the biggest monster manual that D&amp;D has ever had with over 500 monsters. This is meant to help populate the world with monsters, but also prompt the DMs with ideas for how adventures could be created around them.</p>
<p>75 of the monster in the book are brand new. Certain groups, like skeletons, have been expanded to include new types of skeletal enemies. Attention was drawn to a fiery mage skeleton in an illustration.&nbsp;Artwork is going to highlight the monsters in their habitat to give an idea of not just what they can do, but their temperament.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sketletons_andrey-kuzinskiy.jpg?itok=S5QnrOSR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sketletons_andrey-kuzinskiy.jpg?itok=kdZFhyb6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A group of skeletons, including a new variant, by Andrey Kuzinskiy</figcaption></figure><p>NPC stat blocks have also been expanded, performers and pirates are two NPC types that have been expended.</p>
<p>Plenty of High CR threats have also been added so that there can be more challenging monsters for players to face off against. The Blob Of Annihilation, a high CR ooze, was one of the giant options thrown out.</p>
<p>Just like with the release of Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse any of the remixed monsters are remaining at the same CR, but it's important that if they weren't meeting that CR potential they have all been given a power boost and more options.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In my first moments with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990947/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-trailer"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, I found myself in a graveyard dotted with incorporeal gravestones… and puddles of glowing blood. By the time I remembered what those bloodstains meant and the <em>imminent danger</em> I was in, I was ripped to shreds by a man I did not see or hear coming, leaving behind a new little blood puddle to mark the occasion.</p><p>I have not stopped grinning since.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is the long-awaited expansion of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">2022’s game of the year, <em>Elden Ring</em></a>. According to FromSoftware, this will be the only DLC for the game, giving Tarnished one last crack at the Lands Between.</p><p>Most of my time with the DLC has been wrapped up in exploring Belurat, Tower Settlement, one of the legacy dungeons that dot the map that game director Hidetaka Miyazaki described as being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-interview">as big as <em>Elden Ring</em>’s Limgrave</a>. Belurat is a labyrinthine place, filled with lovely blind corners from which enemies can ambush me and attractive puke-brown waterfalls that lead to at least one of the DLC’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/elden-ring-has-multiple-poison-swamps-because-i-cant-help-myself-miyazaki-says/">poison swamps</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>“Ahh, this poison swamp smells like home.”</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware / Ash Parrish</cite></p></div><p>Despite that enticing description, Belurat is a really pretty place. It’s cast in the same pallor of pale gold as any location in the base game. And I loved looking up at the skybox and seeing what looked like billowing fabric cascading down from the sky as though the whole dungeon were covered in a gauzy funeral shroud.</p><p>The dungeon’s inhabitants, though, are less pretty to look at and not pretty at all to fight. The most basic enemies I faced were shadowy humanoid creatures, scorpions, and huge scraggly birds. Most of the time, the humans didn’t bother me unless I got too close or ventured into their line of sight. However, there was a hardier version of the humanoids who kicked the living crap out of me up and down the dungeon.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their strength, though, the humanoids were easy to kill — most creatures in the dungeon were. This, in turn, led me into a whole mess of problems of my own making.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing <em>Elden Ring</em> successfully means keeping this in mind at all times: if you see one enemy, in reality, there are four coming up right behind you. And if, by some chance, you see the four, there are <em>actually 12 of them</em>, and congratulations, you are now dead.</p><p>Ad nauseam, ad infinitum.</p><p>This lesson is pretty easily learned once you’ve spent more than an hour in the Shadow Lands. However, the reason I died so many times — and the reason I haven’t been able to make much headway in the DLC — is that I let myself get lured in by how deceptively easy the enemies were to kill. Everything went down in one or two swings of my <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Moonveil">upgraded sword</a>. If I was lucky enough to sneak up behind an enemy, the resulting surprise attack one-shot them. This built an unearned confidence in me that took a long time to dismantle. I was essentially saying to myself, “Yes, I am surrounded, but one more hit and I’ll be — oh, heck, there’s 12 of them.”&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>Beware, there are probably three more monsters lurking just off frame in this picture.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware</cite></p></div><p>I was too greedy and too cocky, lacking the humility necessary to navigate <em>Erdtree</em> safely. And I think such a lesson is vital as lots of players prepare themselves for <em>Erdtree</em>. Taking down Mohg, Lord of Blood — one of the bosses required to access <em>Erdtree —</em> is one of the harder accomplishments in the game (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177080/and-most-of-em-still-havent-beaten-mohg">something not a lot of players have done according to Steam charts</a>). And beating him or any of the other harder bosses, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066977/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-defeats-1000th-malenia">like Malenia</a>, might instill in players the same undeserved arrogance I had — the kind that made me think I could just waltz through the new DLC untouched.</p><p>Tarnished, as you embark on your journey, learn from my mistakes and do not be deceived. You will die — <em>a lot</em>.&nbsp;Be slow, be methodical, be patient... upgrade your <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mimic+Tear+Ashes">Mimic Tear ashes</a>.</p><p>And while it was frustrating to die so much at the hands of things I knew I could easily defeat, I never felt cheated by any of my fifty ‘leven demises because I understood they were all my fault.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time I got to Belurat’s boss, I figured I was in for another lesson. I wondered how many times I’d die before learning the boss’s patterns and tricks. But then another beautiful moment happened: I cheesed my way through it. I used one of the game’s summons, called up my Mimic Tear ally, and stayed back, pelting the boss with the hardest working damage spell in the Lands Between: the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Glintstone+Pebble">Glintstone Pebble</a>.</p><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will humble the living daylights out of you, and you will thank the game for the pleasure. But you, too, have the ability to shame it back — use it.</p><p>Playing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is like visiting that strict grandma you love but don’t get to see very often. Whenever you see her again after a long absence, it takes a moment for you to get reacquainted with her quirky but tough-ass customs. And when you finally do get back into the rhythm, it feels like you’ve never left.</p><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> launches June 21st on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, a new entry in the series, is coming to Nintendo Switch in a few months.</p>
<p>The first new entry in the series in nine years, which will focus on a new seafaring adventure where Mario and Luigi will have to collaborate on the field and in combat as is usual in the series, will be released on Nintendo Switch on November 7th worldwide as confirmed by the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5I3DcapElQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal trailer</a> showed during today's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5I3DcapElQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>The bond between brothers has never been stronger! Set sail for an island-hopping adventure with the Mario Bros. in Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership!</em></p>

<p>The past few months have been great for role-playing games fans who also love Mario. Following the Super Mario RPG Remake released last year, Nintendo recently released the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake on Nintendo Switch, which improves the game's visuals while keeping what made the original so good intact. You can learn more about it with Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>While the new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door preserves the gonzo charm that made the original game a cult classic, not a lot has been done to deal with its padding and other design quirks. If you’re a hardcore Thousand-Year Door fan, worry not, you’re going to love this spiffy new version. If you’re new to the game or weren’t entirely sold the first time around, you’re still likely to find plenty to enjoy here, but you may also notice a few tattered edges.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Our <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> review is here and it’s been one hell of an undertaking. Read on to discover our thoughts on what must be the most highly-anticipated DLC release of this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you enjoy this review then you should consider checking out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our <em>Elden Ring</em> review</a> for our thoughts on the base game too. We also have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/lies-of-p-starter-hub" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a bunch of guides for <em>Lies of P</em></a>, one of last year's best Souls-likes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> Review - Back to the Land’s Between</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-warrior-with-a-strange-metal-cone-on-their-head-standing-in-a-golden-field.jpg?itok=Qj-2ICny 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-warrior-with-a-strange-metal-cone-on-their-head-standing-in-a-golden-field.jpg?itok=Zf4cKXvR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As my journey in The Land of Shadow begins I am a naive, metal-cone-wearing baby, about to be taught a lesson.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is the first, and probably only, DLC release for FromSoftware’s 2022 smash hit <em>Elden Ring</em>. Of course, unless you’re living in a ditch somewhere, then you probably already know that. FromSoftware has proven that their formula works and now almost everyone has been talking about this release, but will it live up to the hype? Let’s be honest, this is FromSoft so...yeah it probably will be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with any FromSoft title, the DLC has to be accessed before you can actually play it, and in this specific case, you’re going to need to be confident in your abilities well before you start out. Not only will you need to fight against a pretty tough optional boss (technically 2), but it’s very clear this DLC has been designed with end-game players in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Power to the People</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-naked-man-weilding-a-pare-of-flaming-claws.jpg?itok=n3rIqGiu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-naked-man-weilding-a-pare-of-flaming-claws.jpg?itok=fTuBydPw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I am become death, destroyer of social norms surrounding the amount of clothing it is acceptable to be outside in.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> feels like it’s raising the power barrier from the base game. Even the most OP builds from base game feel like they’re struggling to make a dent against many of the enemies and bosses. So, if you felt like the main game wasn’t challenging enough, you masochist, then you’re in luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What of the rest? If you’re the type of person who struggles with the challenges then you do at least have some new buffs to look forward to. While you’re exploring the new Land of Shadow, you’ll get access to two new blessings that passively increase damage output and reduce damage intake for both you and your spirit ashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also a huge swathe of new weapons, including 8 new weapon types, and new spirit ashes, spells, and armor to make your journey through the shadows a little less harrowing. Some of them are pretty top-notch too, with the Great Katana and Thrusting Shield archetypes in particular being a blast to use if you can find the right weapon arts.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Harking Back To Games Past</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-warrior-on-a-horse-avoiding-a-giant-laser-made-of-light-and-fire.jpg?itok=86M_oKXk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-warrior-on-a-horse-avoiding-a-giant-laser-made-of-light-and-fire.jpg?itok=amlRsNRE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I would say I dodged a bullet, but I'm pretty sure I just dodged a cataclysm.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a lot to love about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, especially if you’ve been a long-time series fan. While <em>Elden Ring</em> gave players a new, highly refined experience in the genre, Shadow feels like it’s revisiting design aesthetics and level designs that have been with the series since the very beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll see designed aspects of Anor Londo, Byrgenwerth, and various other places from across the series’ history. It’s a nice tinge of nostalgia without feeling like retreading old ground and it was certainly a comfort to me, as the various new bosses repeatedly ground me into the dirt.</p>
<p>The feelings of nostalgia extended into the new weapons too actually. The new 'Beast Claw' class of weapons is literally named the same thing as a weapon from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/bloodborne-review-bloody-classic" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne</em></a>&nbsp;and was a lot of fun getting to play around with them.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bosses, Monsters, and More</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-you-died-message-over-the-top-of-a-scene-of-the-ongoing-battle.jpg?itok=zqF2vkb_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-you-died-message-over-the-top-of-a-scene-of-the-ongoing-battle.jpg?itok=YCZwrWcP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No doubt this monster is cool, but it's much harder to appreciate from beneath its thunderbolts.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Easily some of the best aspects of Shadow of the Erdtree are the new bosses and enemies you get to fight. Whether you like a challenge or not, you will probably have to appreciate these new bosses for their incredible visuals, music, and gameplay design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, I won’t go into spoiler territory for the bosses, but much like the base game, Shadow of the Erdtree is stuffed full of bosses. They’re at the end of the new legacy dungeons, they’re strewn all over the open plains and tracks of the overworld, and they’re sequestered away in the nooks and crannies of caves. It's important to note, though, that the volume of bosses does leave some being duplicates or stronger 'regular' enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a decent variety of different fights on offer too. You’ll cross blades with single human-sized warriors, as well as with the <em>Elden Ring</em> equivalent of those Chinese Dragon Puppets, and each fight usually offers at least one or two things that make it interesting. In particular, the second half of the fight against Messmer is stunning, even if it also left me splattered all over the floor more times than I care to remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the new basic enemy mobs can put up a fight, and I highly recommend you leave most of the inhabitants of the opening plains alone until you’ve acclimatized to things. Even then, you're constantly coming up against new mobs and special encounters that have new ways to murder you, and isn't that what these games are all about?&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hitting Your Head Against The Brick Wall(s)</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-strangely-dressed-character-standing-near-some-giant-feet.jpg?itok=WvwhBz05 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-a-strangely-dressed-character-standing-near-some-giant-feet.jpg?itok=YAYuFtyk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They've got to have known that someone was going to get off on this?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>A big point of focus in Shadow of the Erdtree has been on exploration, but this time with the twist of having much more verticality to it. You’re constantly having to either look for spirit vents to launch yourself upwards, or pick your way carefully down the side of hills and mountains. There were countless dead-ends that eventually ended up leading me to places once I’d thrown caution to the wind and started launching myself off random cliffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new exploration is mostly a joy, giving you a new way of looking at the world once you wrap your head around it. That said, the sheer scope of what there is to find in this DLC can sometimes make things more than a little tricky. Those map marker hints are great and all, but after 4 hours of running around a lightning-stricken mountainside with zero results, I’m ready to start ignoring them entirely.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-someone-with-a-comically-large-sword-and-a-giant-lion-head.jpg?itok=jAc-ilMs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-screenshot-showing-someone-with-a-comically-large-sword-and-a-giant-lion-head.jpg?itok=5c3NU9Tt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It was all worth it for that beast head.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>When all is said and done, <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is exactly what people are expecting. This is a new slice of <em>Elden Ring</em> with more challenges, exploration, and heavy lore implications than you can shake a broken sword at. &nbsp;The new perspective on exploration is a lot of fun and results in many eureka moments, even if you can also be left wondering how exactly you were supposed to figure this stuff out on your own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real truth is that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has some of the best bosses of the entire series, in terms of both mechanics and design, and also gives us another 30+ hours of <em>Elden Ring</em> to play. At this point, it would have to do something atrocious to warrant anything less than adoration and praise at least, as long as you're already on board. Otherwise, I definitely wouldn't look to this DLC as the thing to finally help you 'get' this franchise/genre/monolith.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="zyZ0n3"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23810505/hello-kitty-island-adventure-review-apple-arcade-animal-crossing"><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em></a>, an adorable life-sim featuring a cast of Sanrio characters, has been freed from Apple Arcade jail. Developer Sunblink and Sanrio announced the game will be released on the Nintendo Switch and Windows PC in 2025. After that, it will also come to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, a release said. The developer shared the news via a trailer as part of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175496/nintendo-direct-june-date-time-switch">Nintendo Direct on Tuesday</a>. </p>
<p id="qJwGRd"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23787195/south-park-butters-hello-kitty-island-adventure-apple-arcade-release-date"><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em></a> has all the fixings of an adorable life-sim and then some. You can design an adorable character, collect materials, craft, fish, and explore alongside a rather large cast of Sanrio characters. The game, which was originally released on iOS via Apple Arcade in summer 2023, continues to be updated by the development team. The developers released a mermaid-inspired update as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzL6tD5C0Gs">recently as May</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC9j-f7p48Y">flowery Merry Meadow</a> to celebrate spring.</p>
<p id="xHD5Vl">Fans of <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> might immediately notice parallels between the two games both in terms of the cutesy art style and gameplay. <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure </em>definitely goes a lot harder on the “adventure” part of it all — you spend a lot of time climbing and exploring in <em>Island Adventure</em> — but it could be a great option for Animal Crossing fans looking for a game to hold them over until the release of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">Nintendo Switch successor</a>.</p>

  <p id="1yotAX"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is a humbling experience, one that will remind you of your early days  — and early defeats — in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. </p>
<p id="YIvHHA">FromSoftware’s expansion to its 2022 open-world RPG will hit you harder and faster than anything in the base game did, regardless of how strong you’ve become over the course of <em>Elden Ring</em>. But for players with patience and perseverance, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> features some of the most rewarding game content in all of <em>Elden Ring</em>. The roughly 40-hour expansion is a true test of skill, but with dozens of new weapons, spells, and magical items at your disposal, players have a wider, more interesting breadth of battle techniques to draw upon.</p>

<p id="UIgKDm">Even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-start-dlc-access-point-location-miquellas-cocoon">accessing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> is a challenge. Players can’t dive into it by selecting a menu item, the way they would for most DLC expansions. Instead, they’ll need to have already beaten two relatively challenging bosses from the main game: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mohg, Lord of Blood</a>. This is FromSoft tradition; the developer had similar roadblocks in place in expansions for <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>. But with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176047/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-preparation-achievements-completed">only a fraction of <em>Elden Ring</em> players</a> having already met the requirements for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, the DLC is clearly aimed at its most dedicated and persistent players.</p>
<p id="ok4RBn">Like the base game, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> starts by setting players’ expectations with powerful new enemies. Take the Furnace Golem. This giant walking brazier is one of the first awe-inspiring sights you’ll see when venturing into the new region, the Land of Shadow. Facing it early likely means certain death for newcomers in this land, as the golem will spew fireballs, kick flaming embers at you, or stomp you with its blazing feet. Like everything else in the expansion, the Furnace Golem is stronger and more deadly than anything you’ve met in <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p id="88IPE2">To compensate for these new extreme challenges, you will meet with new allies who will help you on your journey. Like you, there are other warriors searching for the demigod Miquella — and for Miquella’s sworn enemy, Messmer the Impaler, who brought devastation to this shadowy land. At new campsites marked by golden crosses, Miquella’s followers will act as guides, quest givers, and merchants. You’ll follow them and their stories throughout the expansion, as they provide a mostly straightforward narrative throughline.</p>
<p id="Jh1XU8"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> introduces a new leveling system that’s unique to the region. Scattered throughout the land are splinters of the giant, decaying tree that looms over the shadow realm, much like the giant golden Erdtree of the Lands Between. These Scadutree Fragments will magically boost your stats, helping you to meet the level of challenge in the DLC. I highly recommend hunting each and every one down.</p>
<p id="xERXSq">As with the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, the excessive challenge of some enemies and boss encounters is intended as an indication that you may not be ready to face them yet. Go, explore, and find more Scadutree Fragments, as your repeated deaths will remind you. And there’s a huge swath of land to explore in the shadow realm; <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> feels much bigger than its creators promised, with circuitous routes and secrets that lead to even more secrets.</p>

</p>
<p id="QVGnCg">The journey across the Land of Shadow can feel oppressive and lonelier than the original <em>Elden Ring</em>. The shadow realm is a dark and gloomy place, appropriately, and the sheer landmass can feel barren at times. There are diversions to discover, like catacombs, mausoleums, and new underground areas called forges, but huge portions of the shadow realm feel surprisingly empty. There are fewer interesting encounters and side characters to meet here, and an absence of merchants.</p>
<p id="69bGFi">Elsewhere, there are densely packed castles and keeps, including a massive, mazelike region known as Shadow Keep. This towering research facility is unlike anything else in <em>Elden Ring</em>, serving as a hub to puzzle your way through; no less than five exits from the keep lead to important destinations in the Land of Shadow, yet these paths can only be discovered by thoroughly exploring the keep’s confusing architecture. And while you’ll spend plenty of time unearthing the keep’s secrets, the places it takes you are wildly diverse, ranging from ancient moss-covered ruins to hinterlands covered in flowers to wastelands filled with the bodies of Furnace Golems.</p>
<p id="kybYGm">There’s some repetition throughout the expansion. You’ll still be fighting many of the same enemies from the original <em>Elden Ring</em>; not every creature you fight is brand-new. Certain parts of the geography are refreshingly original, including a region that evokes <em>Bloodborne</em>-like horror, with skulking enemies that can’t be killed but can only be avoided as you creep through fog-drenched swamplands.</p>

</p>
<p id="wkpCmy">There’s a huge amount of variety when it comes to combat, thanks to dozens of new weapons spread across multiple new styles. I gravitated toward the new light greatsword class of melee weapon, specifically favoring a sword called the Milady that enables fanciful twirling slashes and is reliable for staggering enemies. I wound up respeccing my character a few times, testing new great katanas for their hard-hitting power and new martial arts fighting styles to unleash flurries of kicks and punches. It seems that wherever there was previously a gap in <em>Elden Ring</em>’s available fighting styles, such as between light and heavy swords, or in weapon types that weren’t ideal for a particular character build, FromSoftware has filled in those spaces with new ideas and fighting styles in the DLC.</p>
<p id="db7yi6">Again, even with all the new swords and sorceries, new types of Crystal Tears and Talismans, new recipes and crafting items, there’s still an incredible level of challenge in the new DLC. None of the new content will make you a god. If some bosses felt like brick walls in the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, the bosses of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> feel like rebar-reinforced solid concrete. Early-game bosses like the Divine Beast Dancing Lion and Rellana, Twin Moon Knight throw flurries of attacks at you, shift their elemental damage to keep you guessing, and give no quarter. Everything in the DLC is some form of relentless, and if base <em>Elden Ring</em> was too challenging for you, you’ll only find harder challenges here.</p>
<p id="oUBuKu">But there’s more to experiment with, and so much more to explore in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, that the challenges can always wait until you’re ready for them. Even 40-plus hours in, I’m still figuring out how to tackle a particularly nasty dragon. And despite cursing all the bosses I’ve felled so far, as they’ve beaten me into submission dozens of times, I’m looking forward to going back and starting it all over at some point, ready to take on the challenge again. </p>

There’s a cast of pun-based enemies and returning frenemies like Bowser, and all of it is rendered in a cel-shaded-lite art-style that brings some of the playful vibrancy of the earlier games to the Switch’s improved hardware. </p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p>One thing fans might be quick to notice is that it doesn’t look like there’s some overriding gimmick that threatens to upstage the main story and gameplay fundamentals. That was a main criticism of the more recent entries, including <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam</em>. Of course, Nintendo might reveal more deep-dive trailers in the future that show a hidden mechanic for <em>Brothership</em>, but for now it looks like the back-to-basics approach fans have wanted. </p><p>Previously, Nintendo had been remastering the early games in the series for 3DS. It seemed likely the company would continue doing that and bring <em>Partners in Time </em>or <em>Dream Team</em> to the Switch, but it’s nice to see that instead players are getting a completely new game after all these years. </p><p>It’s also been cool to see Nintendo doubling-down on the RPG side of the<em> Mario Bros.</em> franchise. Last year we got the <em>Super Mario RPG </em>remake and earlier this year we got the remaster of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. Fans of turn-based Mario antics and offbeat humor have been eating well. The Switch’s final years continue to deliver some nice surprises. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first is support for sign-in screens on public Wi-Fi networks. Think coffee shops and hotel rooms, or anywhere else that requires more than just a simple password to begin accessing the internet. The new feature allows owners to scan a QR code on their PS Portal and sign-in through their smartphone. <br></p><p>The second new feature is improved visual feedback for the touchscreen. A translucent white box now appears on the screen when you touch it to indicate whether you’re tapping, holding, or swiping. It seems simple, but it should help the overall experience feel a little smoother and more responsive. </p><figure id="" data-id="6e5945eb17a1a26fcec3c31b96dd95e5" data-recommend-id="image://6e5945eb17a1a26fcec3c31b96dd95e5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="PS Portal displays new touch screen feedback.

He also said that online multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>EA Sports FC 24</em> are routinely some of the most played on the device, despite potential latency or framerate issues. </p><p>Given the positive reception so far, it seems like the PS Portal will continue getting updated with more features.

The release date for the new Super Mario animated movie in Japan has been set for April 24, 2026. We are working with the Illumination team to make it a fun movie, so please continue to look forward to it.</p></blockquote><p>It’s worth noting that Japan’s release of the first movie was significantly later than most other territories. The U.S. first saw <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> on April 1, 2023, with general release on the 5th—the same day as much of the rest of the world. However, Japanese cinemas didn’t get the film until April 28.</p><p>So, if the same pattern repeats in 2026, there’s a good chance our release date could be more like April 1.

It didn’t do anything spectacularly surprising, but then it wasn’t aiming for shock twists or some sort of fourth-wall-breaking metanarrative.

However, it feels fair to suggest that Mario has enough history and variation to offer enormous possibilities. For instance, just imagine a <em>Mario Bros. 2</em> that incorporates many different instances of the character interacting—a <em>Marioverse</em> if you will. The first movie’s Mario meets Paper Mario meets 2D Mario meets N64 Mario meets Jumpman, after Bowser rampages across the dimensions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mario-luigi-brothership-announced-for-november-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>During today’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct showcase</a>, Nintendo announced Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership will launch on November 7, 2024.</p>



<p>It’s a new platformer featuring the titular heroes, working together to traverse through familiar colorful worlds.</p>



<p>Today’s trailer also began with a brief cinematic starting near Princess Peach’s castle. The sudden appearance of a strange portal hints at the basic premise, where Mario and Luigi must find a way home.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024 – Nintendo Switch" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kX3BkD5PVUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The reveal trailer also features some of the characters, worlds, and mini games that fans can expect. That includes a glimpse of the villainous Bowser, co-op mechanics, and more.</p>



<p>The Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership announcement closely follows the release date reveal for the anticipated Super Mario Bros. sequel film, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in 2026</a>. The first film prominently focused on Mario and Luigi’s bond, so the new game certainly aligns with that theme.</p>



<p>The Mario game franchise also continues to thrive, as Mario vs. Donkey Kong and Princess Peach: Showtime both hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 million units sold</a>.</p>



<p>Some fans might be dismayed that Nintendo has not confirmed the anticipated Switch successor during today’s event. However, the President of Nintendo Shuntaro Furukawa did previously warn fans this Direct would not address that device. </p>



<p>Further, Furukawa did confirm that Nintendo will reveal it sometime <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within this fiscal year</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will keep you up to date with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything announced</a> at today’s Nintendo Direct showcase.</p>

The most recent one, Paper Jam, was a crossover of sorts with the other series of Mario RPGs, Paper Mario. This has been a big year for Mario RPGs already--a remake of the original Super Mario RPG released in November, and a remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door released recently. Now with the return of Mario &amp; Luigi, we've seen every major branch of Mario RPGs represented very recently.</p>

        <p>Company aims to help support self-publishers and provide advice on branding</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>George Willard and Sophie Atkin have co-founded new visibility agency Secret Sauce.</p>
<p>Both Willard and Atkin previously worked for indie publisher Modern Wolf, where Willard was head of brand and Atkin was senior communications manager.</p>
<p>Their new agency will focus on providing support for self-publishing titles, advice on branding, and helping publishers find and secure games.</p>
<p>Secret Sauce's clients include Canadian developer Goose Byte, US-based studio Wallride Games, and UK indie publisher Fireshine.</p>
<p>"The idea for Secret Sauce came from wanting to make a difference in the games space after hearing the same issues over and over from devs and publishers alike," said Willard. "But it became a reality after a ten-minute company-wide call, where we were told we may all be about to lose our jobs."</p>
<p>Atkin added: "We aren’t going to be an agency who over-promises and to be propelled by AI-driven cloud-based Web3 technology. We are here for transparent and straightforward discussions, whether that's around pricing or being able to identify our client's needs."</p>

This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a "seafaring adventure" that will include new evolved "Bros moves".</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5I3DcapElQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.</p>

<p data-characters="166" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’d recognize that Luigi design anywhere. As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</em> was announced. It has a November 7, 2024 release date.</p> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">They point out that this is the first new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> in almost 9 years. It’s also the first one since AlphaDream filed for bankruptcy. So, that’s kind of sad. Here’s the trailer:</p> <figure data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5I3DcapElQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">It shows off a lot of staples of the series. Both Mario and Luigi, for example. There are action commands in its battles that take the form of little mini-games. There’s also some great looking platforming. The environments look nice.</p> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">I’m going to be real: I have never completed a <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> game. This isn’t really important to say because I don’t think they’re bad, they just don’t jive with me. I’ve played a few, and nope, none of them have clicked. In any case, I’m mostly just wondering if any of AlphaDream’s staff are working on it.</p>
 <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="70" data-injectable="false"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> launches on Switch on November 7, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="231" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of the Nintendo Direct, Sunblink announced that their hit Apple Arcade game <em>Hello Kitty: Island Adventure</em> is leaving behind its mobile exclusivity and coming to Switch and PC (followed later by PS4/PS5 a bit later) in 2025.</p> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, it’s a life simulator starring Sanrio’s ubiquitous cast of cute characters. It’s maybe in the same wheelhouse as <em>Animal Crossing</em>, but not entirely. My Melody (that’s a character) is opening a store in a theme park on a tropical island, and you have been brought along to help. But the park is abandoned, and the trip can only be saved with the power of friendship.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Hello Kitty Island Adventure - Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcOeBW92ioU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">There’s a character creator. You can decorate your friendship cabin. There’s baking. The press blurb says it’s over 100 hours, and I believe them. More importantly: there are no microtransactions. It’s been getting updated with new content since it was first released on iOS.</p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false"><em>Hello Kitty: Island Adventure</em> was really well received on Apple Arcade. It was nominated at <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-game-awards-2023-winners-all-awards-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2023</a> for Best Mobile Game, if you remember. It lost to <em>Honkai Star Rail</em> because there’s no justice in our world, but it did win the Webby People’s Choice award as well as the Apple Arcade Game of the Year Award. Kitty’s got papers.</p> <p data-characters="125" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="false"><em>Hello Kitty: Island Adventure</em> is coming to Switch and PC sometime in 2025. It will also arrive on PS4 and PS5 sometime later.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree.904305/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With a game as big as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a></em>, you better believe that it’s worth digging up every single scrap we can with multiple writers on the case. Read on as Steven Mills and I dissect the gargantuan, and frankly surprising, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> [reviewed],&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4, PS5</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/elden-ring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</a>]<br>Developer: From Software<br>Publisher: Bandai Namco<br>Released: June 20, 2024<br>MSRP: $39.99</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false"><strong>Chris Carter</strong>: Well, here we are, at the likely end of the <em>Elden Ring</em> era (at least, as far as the first entry is concerned). While it sounds hyperbolic to call it an “era,” it really was! Everyone went crazy for this one, and many people who had never picked up a <em>SekiSoulsBourne </em>game grabbed this one for the first time.</p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">I’m gonna be honest: I was blown away by this expansion. It reminds me of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dark-souls-remastered/">Artorias of the Abyss</a></em> (the sole expansion-esque DLC for <em>Dark Souls </em>1) in all the best ways, with a gigantic single sandbox to play around in. It’s one of my single favorite areas in From Software history. Thoughts?</p>
 <p data-characters="687" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"><strong>Steven Mills:</strong> I totally agree, and here we are again with From Software exceeding my expectations in pretty much every way imaginable. This is the most solid overall DLC by From Software yet. I feel like it takes a lot of the good from previous DLC like <em>Artorias of the Abyss</em>, as you mentioned, as well as<em> The Ringed City</em> from <em>Dark Souls 3 </em>and even some<em> Old Hunters </em>from <em>Bloodborne,</em> while also still pushing everything forward. A gigantic sandbox is really the best way to put it. There’s nothing on rails in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree,</em> and The Land of Shadow gives us the freedom to explore however we want, just like most of the base game. A true “expansion” in every way.</p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true"><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, it really does take a lot from columns A, B, and C. One thing I think they really leaned into is the “spiderweb/spokes on a wheel environmental design.” Their philosophy has always incorporated this, especially with the Firelink Shrine in 2011 (time flies!), but with several of the specific areas in the<em> Erdtree</em> DLC, they can feel endless. Take one of the key areas, the Shadow Keep. I entered this zone fairly early in, and was finding new entrances and secrets in it 10 hours later. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true">The best part is that if you actually want to just work through these areas and finish the DLC, you can. Nothing feels needlessly gated. You basically just go where you want, with a few story-related exceptions. It’s a fantastic way to approach a DLC, without making it feel too small or too pointlessly wide open like some other studios. It’s a skill they’ve honed for decades going back to their <em>King’s Field</em> era. This just makes me excited to see what they can do for their next project: assuming it’s not a <em>Bloodborne </em>PC port.</p>
 <p data-characters="588" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true"><strong>Steven:</strong> Oh yeah, the Shadow Keep is so massive and intricate that it quite literally feels like it could have been its own DLC, if this was an earlier <em>Souls</em> game. As for the actual level design, it’s kind of insane how many different regions and biomes have been squeezed into this single release. <span>My first<em>&nbsp;Elden Ring</em>&nbsp;playthrough was back in early 2022 when it originally came out, but recently, I played through again to freshen up a bi</span>t and ended up taking this run in a very different direction&nbsp; — both in terms of build/playstyle as well as the path I took along the way. </p>
 <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">People will be able to do the same sort of thing with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>; there is no definitive path you must take to get to most of the zones. Early on in the DLC when I realized just how much was here, I asked myself that very question: where does From Software go from here? <em>Elden Ring,</em> and now<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em> are such massive steps forward for the genre that From Software has been pioneering for over a decade now, but like you, I’m excited to see what that could be.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><strong>Chris: </strong>There are a few biomes that some people will likely never even see. And I will definitely be replaying this and taking a different route the next time I start up an <em>Elden Ring</em> run. It meshes so well, in the sense that you can completely ignore it or dive into it for as long as a chunk of the core game. That eventual all-inclusive Game of the Year edition is looking even more enticing. </p>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">What did you think of the new enemies and bosses? Even the tombs with the bite-sized NPC encounters and the DLC crypts felt fresh.</p> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><strong>Steven</strong>: Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how there’s still very little overlap in boss encounter mechanics even after so many bosses! I will say, and I don’t&nbsp;<strong>think</strong>&nbsp;this is a skill issue, but the bosses in&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>&nbsp;as a whole feel a bit tougher than the base game.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>features encounters all across the board ranging from rather trivial (Rennala) to painstaking difficult (Melania)<em>,&nbsp;</em>but I’d say most <em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>bosses trend on the tougher side.</p>
 <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">Speaking of Rennala, one of the earlier boss fights in&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>&nbsp;is her younger sister, Rellana. Unlike her sister, Rellana is no pushover. A dual Greatsword-wielding fighter, Rellana carries a level of grace as she masterfully danced around her arena carving me up. I’m not proud of how many attempts it took me to bring her down, but in classic <em>Souls-</em>like fashion I felt quite accomplished when I finally did. The encounter somewhat reminded me of Dancer of the Boreal Valley from&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3,</em>&nbsp;which is one of my favorite fights of all time.</p>
 <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="61" data-injectable="false">How did you fare with Rellana? Is it a skill issue after all?</p> <figure data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="901" data-injectable="true"><strong>Chris</strong>: don’t think it was a skill issue, haha. Rellana was a ton of fun, and I also thought of the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, as well as Pontiff Sulyvahn (<em>Dark Souls 3</em> loves those elemental sword fights). I think people are going to be talking and sharing war stories all over again, especially in terms of the boss difficulty disparity, depending on people’s builds and approaches. Erdtree straddled the line between reusing enemies and introducing new ones, but it rises to the occasion and feels like its own unique thing. </p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Just like other<em> Souls </em>games, there are enemies some people will always run past and never beat, and several that folks will spend a ton of time on: and I’m not even talking about bosses, as the Erdtree DLC has these really neat flaming giants called Furnace Golems. You can see them stomping around from a mile away and they add to the danger of the zone, and tie nicely into its theme.</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="771" data-injectable="true"><strong>Steven: </strong>From Software really knows how to do scale, that’s for sure. The Furnace Golems are such a nice touch, both in terms of the added threat in this new area, but also in illustrating the scale. My first glimpse reminded me of reaching Atlus Plateau in the base game for the first time; the feeling of immediately feeling small and unprepared for what’s to come.</p>
 <p data-characters="569" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">And I like that taking them down rewards you with new Crystal Tears, some of which have the potential to really change up some builds. But at the same time, I think someone could opt to just skirt around and not bother taking on the Furnace Golems. That’s another really cool aspect of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>&nbsp;is that all the additions and systems are still complimentary to the core&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>&nbsp;experience. Even the new progression systems adds new forms of player power while still respecting what players’ have achieved in the base game.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true"><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, respecting time really is the core of what this DLC is about. You can explore for 20-30 hours and still feel like there’s more to do. I like how there could be all sorts of speedrun categories for this, including how many DLC buff items (Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes) to use. It can be as tough as you want it to be, or you can slowly gain power. It’s the best of both worlds, especially with how tough a few of the later bosses are.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Any closing thoughts? I was assuming this one would be a winner given how strong Elden Ring was as a whole, but it exceeded my expectations.</p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><strong>Steven</strong>: I think that’s the biggest point here, is that even though my expectations were high, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> still managed to exceed them. From Software probably could have just added more<em> Elden Ring </em>and that would have been solid enough, but instead<em>, Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is yet another innovative iteration of the genre.</p>

And we know that 40 minutes of games is a lot to keep track of. That’s why we put together a single list of everything that was announced and shown. </p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/18/xbox-game-pass-june-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a>, Xbox announced the second wave of titles coming to the Game Pass in June 2024.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-new-game-pass-titles-for-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a>, Still Wakes the Deep, the first-person horror game about an oil rig disaster, is available today at launch. The following titles are coming to Game Pass in the second half of June:</p>



<ul>
<li>My Time at Sandrock – June 19</li>



<li>Keplerth – June 20</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 24 – June 25</li>



<li>SteamWorld Dig – June 26</li>



<li>SteamWorld Dig 2 – June 26</li>



<li>Robin Hood – Sherwood Builders – June 27</li>
</ul>



<p>This new group of titles, much like the first half of June, puts an emphasis on indie developers.</p>



<p>My Time at Sandrock is a life sim and sandbox indie hit that first launched in November 2023. It still maintains Very Positive ratings on Steam. SteamWorld is an ever-evolving indie series, and its pair of games launched even further back.</p>



<p>Robin Hood – Sherwood Builders is a more recent title. It’s an indie action RPG based on the titular character, which earned Mostly Positive Steam ratings at launch in February 2024.</p>



<p>The only upcoming Xbox Game Pass title with a larger budget for June 2024 is EA Sports FC 24. Unfortunately, it was met with very mixed user reviews. However, Xbox’s post does point out the title aligns with UEFA EURO 2024, which only just kicked off last week.</p>

                <p>A PlayStation Portal update will roll out on June 19, adding several new enhancements to the gaming handheld. One of the the big updates here will give you more options to use the device outside of your home, as you'll be able to connect to more public Wi-Fi networks like the ones found in airports, hotels, and cafes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4320641-ps-portal-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320641" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4320641-ps-portal-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320641"></a><figcaption>You'll need to scan this QR code to gain access to more public networks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4320641-ps-portal-2.jpg"></figure><p>These public networks typically require you to go through a few more validation steps, and when using the PlayStation Portal to access one, you'll need to scan a QR code from its screen using your smartphone. You can then complete the rest of the validation steps on your mobile device, although it's worth noting that Sony recommends a Wi-Fi connection with at least 5Mbps speed to play, and ideally, a 15Mbps high-speed connection for a smoother gaming experience.</p><p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/18/new-playstation-portal-remote-player-system-software-update-releases-tomorrow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony says</a> it has also added new visual feedback to the touchpad areas, and these effects will be displayed when using the touchpad areas during remote play. In addition, you'll also be able to see the remaining battery level percentage on the status bar after the update has been installed. This is an optional feature accessed in the PlayStation Portal settings, but for anyone who prefers numbers to nebulous battery symbols, it's essential stuff.</p><p>The PlayStation Portal launched in November 2023, and it has proven to be a popular device so far. This streaming device syncs to a PS5 console using wireless technology called PlayStation Link to create smooth gaming sessions, if your internet connection meets the requirements. If you're looking to pick one up for yourself, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/" data-ref-id="1100-6520876">PlayStation Portal restock guide</a> to see if any major retailers have a fresh supply of these units available. Keep in mind, however, that the device isn't for everyone, as we discovered during our hands-on time.</p><p>"With a limited use-case and inconsistent performance from remote play, as well as the way it rarely takes advantage of the PS5 ecosystem, the PlayStation Portal is tough to recommend," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/" data-ref-id="1100-6519416">PlayStation Portal hands-on feature</a>. "If the PS5 is your primary gaming platform, and if you have a strong internet connection throughout your home, <em>and </em>if you're in situations where you're eager to play PS5 games without access to the TV the console is connected to, then you'll get plenty of use out of the Portal."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-survival-ascended-power-rangers-mod</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ark-survival-ascended-gets-official-power-rangers-mod-for-some-reason.904245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-survival-ascended-power-rangers-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modding platform CurseForge has teamed up with Hasbro - yes, actual Hasbro - for an official&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Ascended Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>mod. I promise I'm not making this up.</p>
<p>The mod brings the original&nbsp;<em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>squad into the game, as well as their weapons and Zords. It's launching later today and is a "premium" mod, which means you'll have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Just in case you're wondering, you haven't read this story wrong; this is a mod project rather than an official collaboration between Hasbro and Studio Wildcard or publisher Snail Games, neither of whom appear to be involved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ark-survival-ascended-power-rangers-mod-zords.jpg?itok=Z3bJVTBz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ark-survival-ascended-power-rangers-mod-zords.jpg?itok=LD-aVdGl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yep, that's the Power Rangers in&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Ark x Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>is a collaborative project between Hasbro, CurseForge, and a user-generated content studio called <a href="https://looknorth.world/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Look North World</a>, which also works with&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s UEFN editor.&nbsp;Said studio was brought onto the project in order to "ensure brand integrity", according to a press release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Snail Games and Studio Wildcard don't seem to have been involved in the creation of the mod, the studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399830/view/6533114734894341796" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did announce</a>&nbsp;<em>Ark x Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>on the&nbsp;<em>Survival Ascended&nbsp;</em>Steam page, so they're seemingly endorsing it at the very least.</p>
<p>In total, the mod will offer unique skins, emotes, weapons, and Zords for five Rangers: Red, Blue, Pink, Yellow, and Black. Sadly, the Green Ranger is nowhere to be seen. What's with this Tommy erasure,&nbsp;<em>Ark</em>?</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for this rather strange&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Ascended Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>mod right here.</p>

<p>Along with announcing the mod, Studio Wildcard and Snail Games also took the opportunity to reveal Club ARK, a "new social hub" in which&nbsp;<em>Survival Ascended&nbsp;</em>players can hang out with their friends, take part in minigames, and even duel other&nbsp;<em>Ark&nbsp;</em>players.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what's going on in the world of&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em>, but judging by the aforementioned mod and Club ARK, it kind of seems like the answer is "everything". Here's the trailer for Club ARK, in case you're looking for a new metaverse hangout spot for you and your friends.</p>

<p><em>Ark: Survival Ascended&nbsp;</em>is available right now in Early Access for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0691-PPSA16810_00-SURVIVALASCENDED">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ark-survival-ascended/9P33VJGVPHVP" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
<p>It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-2-delayed-to-end-of-2024-ark-survival-ascended-remaster-announced">reworked version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved&nbsp;</em>that's built in Unreal Engine 5, so you can expect higher visual fidelity than in the original game, plus quality-of-life improvements and access to all of&nbsp;<em>Survival Evolved</em>'s extra worlds as and when they become available.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-3-is-featured-in-still-wakes-the-deep-pax-dei-deep-rock-galactic-and-skye-the-misty-isle.904242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-featured-in-still-wakes-the-deep-pax-dei-deep-rock-galactic-and-skye-the-misty-isle/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation) technology is confirmed to be featured in The Chinese Room's first-person horror game, Still Wakes the Deep. Out today on all platforms for an introductory price of $31.49, the game didn't capture the imagination of Wccftech reviewer Nathan Birch, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated it</a> just 6 out of 10.</p>
<p><em>While Still Wakes the Deep offers up its fair share of thrills, railroad-style level design, a short runtime, and a surprisingly superficial story result in an experience that may entertain in the moment, but will likely be forgotten rather quickly. Still Wakes the Deep may well float your boat at a discount, but there are better, scarier fish in the sea.</em></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3 offers GeForce RTX 40 Series users an average boost of 2.6X at 4K resolution with max settings, according to NVIDIA. There's also the option to swap the Super Resolution component with DLAA, which improves the visual fidelity through AI.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, PC gamers have another Unreal Engine 5 game release to look forward to, the MMORPG Pax Dei by Mainframe Industries (although this game debuts in early access). As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-is-coming-to-horizon-forbidden-west-dragons-dogma-2-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-pax-dei-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, NVIDIA DLSS 3 is available in this game as well, providing GeForce RTX 40 owners an average performance uplift of 3X at 4K resolution with max settings. Pax Dei will stay in early access at least until June 2025; you can read more about the MMORPG in <a href="https://wccftech.com/pax-dei-early-access-qa-mainframe-talks-improvements-from-the-wilderness-alpha-monetization-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our detailed interview</a> from earlier this month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Dei | Early Access trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Bp1gbcZ5N4?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3 will also be available at tomorrow's early access launch of the single player Viking-inspired survival game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710180/Skye_The_Misty_Isle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skye: The Misty Isle</a>. In this case, the average performance uplift is expected to be a bit lower, albeit still noticeable at 2.4X.</p>
<p>Lastly, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-is-getting-nvidia-dlss-3-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, Ghost Ship Games has introduced NVIDIA DLSS 3 support to its hit coop game Deep Rock Galactic with the launch of Season 5: Drilling Deeper.</p>
<p>On another note, NVIDIA is kicking off the '<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/contests/summer-of-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce Summer of RTX</a>' with a plethora of sweepstakes and giveaways featuring prizes such as GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, a Falcon Northwest gaming rig, G-SYNC displays, GeForce RTX keycaps, limited-edition GeForce RTX posters, and more.</p>

  <p id="KYoa16"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22193552/bridgerton-review-shondaland-netflix"><em>Bridgerton</em>’s first season</a> tossed viewers into a lush alternate-history romance and made one thing very, very clear: Unlike in period romances of the past, these characters fucked. A lot. <em>So</em> much. </p>
<p id="7OO6HW">When the first season dropped in the cold doldrums of late 2020, its reputation for being steamy spread like Lady Whistledown’s gossip pamphlet. Daphne and the duke got it on across every surface of their estate, and fans were thrilled. But then seasons 2 and 3 had a sharp decline in the number of sex scenes, leading some viewers to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BridgertonNetflix/comments/ty6lh1/season_2_is_just_not_horny_enough/">complain about the lack of horniness</a> in their torrid Regency romance.</p>

<p id="B2rysI">Here’s the thing, though: Horniness isn’t just about the actual act of sex. It’s about the buildup, the pining, the yearning, and both seasons 2 and 3 have that in buckets. <em>Bridgerton</em>’s sex scenes are going for quality, not just quantity — at least when it comes to the main romantic pairs of each season. </p>
<p id="0sM23C">Thanks to Regency-era double standards, <em>Bridgerton</em> will always have some single man having a threesome with prostitutes in the background, if you just want fornication for the sake of sex scenes. But <em>Bridgerton</em>’s main couples have always been much more than that. From the get-go, the intimate scenes between the romantic leads were always about the nature of their relationship instead of just being sexy for sexy’s sake. It just so happened that Daphne’s whole arc was discovering sex and passion, so there was a <em>lot</em> of boning going on for her. </p>
<p id="21kkhe">But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown">Kate and Anthony’s enemies-to-lovers</a> slow burn wouldn’t have worked if they just made out immediately. Instead, each longing gaze and lingering hand touch slowly stoked and simmered till it boiled over. They had just a single sex scene, but by God, it was so cathartic after a season of verbal sparring and angsty pining. They finally let go! They shed their burdens and responsibilities and found solace in each other’s arms. (And season 3 shows them blissfully happy and making love on every possible surface of their home.) </p>

<p id="M8STqn"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156775/bridgerton-season-3-part-1-review-netflix-polin-3a">Colin and Penelope</a>’s scenes, meanwhile, are equal parts passionate and soft. You can tell these are two people who deeply care about each other — and two people who are dying to rip each other’s clothes off. They don’t have a montage of lustful positions; their few scenes are intimate and tender in a way that sparks a whole different sort of butterflies.</p>
<p id="zZl3Nx"><em>Bridgerton</em>’s best intimate scenes aren’t just hot; they add to the character arcs and relationship developments. Case in point: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157362/bridgerton-queer-characters-benedict-eloise-francesca-brimsley">Benedict’s biwakening</a> threesome in this season. Of all the Bridgerton bros, Benedict’s had the most carefree sex throughout the three seasons. It’s easy to tune out exactly which new girl (or girls) he’s currently cavorting with, especially compared to the other more compelling romantic pairings. But this threesome actually <em>means</em> something. When he turns from his current female paramour Tilly and shares his first kiss with a man, there’s actually a burning tension that finally gets released. It’s a culmination of his character arc, one that gets to explode with fireworks, instead of yet another background hookup for ol’ Benedict. </p>
<p id="3KiLAw">The first season of <em>Bridgerton</em> had a <em>lot</em> of smutty scenes between its leading pair. But just because the other seasons haven’t lived up to the sheer quantity doesn’t make them any lesser. We shouldn’t be lamenting the discrepancy in sex scenes from <em>Bridgerton</em> season 1; we should be celebrating the fact that the showrunners and intimacy coordinators have taken the time and care to showcase different types of romantic moments — and still have them be incredibly hot. </p>
<p id="MqVMhu"><small>All three seasons of </small><small><em>Bridgerton </em></small><small>are now streaming on Netflix. </small></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24180822/zelda-ocarina-of-time-the-deku-trio-jazz<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="GNfbNJ">Last year, musician and video essayist Adam Neely published a fascinating look at what he dubbed “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKWgLe-jQjc">the Nintendo-fication of jazz</a>,” a phenomenon that has seen jazz bands of all stripes, but particularly big bands, increasingly playing arrangements of the fast, frantic music from games like Mario Kart to sold-out audiences. Neely goes into lots of reasons (musicological and otherwise) why this is happening — it’s well worth a watch.</p>
<p id="Hzq8Cp">Now we have another example of this phenomenon, but in a rather different form, from a different starting point. GameChops, a record label which specializes in albums of chilled-out covers of game music — usually in genres like lofi and synthwave, and with titles likes  <em>Chocobo &amp; Chill</em> or <em>Poké &amp; Sleep</em> — has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH69pRR5OfI"><em>Zelda &amp; Jazz</em></a>, a rearrangement of the classic soundtrack for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> for jazz trio. And it’s pretty magnificent, actually.</p>

<p id="Ft1Kg2">Projects like this often end up a bit like musical cosplay — a fun idea that wears out its welcome quite quickly, and doesn’t get under the skin of either the original music or the chosen genre. But there’s no doubting the musicianship here from the artists dubbing themselves — of course — The Deku Trio. GameChops calls the music “coffeehouse-style” jazz, and it’s both very relaxing and musically sophisticated, with piano taking the lead over upright bass and whispering brushed drums.</p>

<p id="O7YQVb">Each track takes one of Koji Kondo’s indelible, simple melodies and briefly reharmonizes and improvises around it for somewhere between two and three minutes. (If there’s a complaint to be made about <em>Zelda &amp; Jazz</em>, it’s that these tracks are kind of short for the genre.) Tune after tune finds a perfect home in this new setting — from “Zelda’s Lullaby” to a casually uptempo, swinging “Song of Storms” — and there are some gentle surprises, too, like the shifting, ruminative chord changes of “Sheik’s Theme” or the bebop syncopation of “Gerudo Valley.” It’s good stuff!</p>
<p id="LXi2X0">Cutely, <a href="https://gamechops.com/zelda-jazz/">GameChops insists</a> the trio is composed of Princess Keys (Zelda) on piano, Lincoln Beats (Link) on drums, and G. Dorf (guess) on bass — as portrayed in some charming illustrations by Riana Dorsey. In fact, the arrangements and piano performances are by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/robarousal/">Rob Araujo</a>. Give him a (very relaxed) hand.</p>

<p>Renowned Japanese video game designer and director Shigeru Miyamoto, whose name sparks excitement in fans’ hearts, made a thrilling announcement today via the official Nintendo X account (formerly Twitter). He confirmed the release date for the highly anticipated “new Super Mario animated movie,” which is set to hit the screens on April 24, 2026, in Japan and other regions soon after. Miyamoto also shared that Nintendo and the Illumination team will collaborate “to make it a fun movie”, hence, fans should look forward to The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2. </p>

However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.</p>

<p>Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.</p>

<p>Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game.&nbsp;We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest.

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Atari and Wayforward <a href="https://youtu.be/r3EpmZ062-g?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have announced</a> that <em>Yars Rising</em>, a spin-off/reimagining of the 1981 Atari 2600 title, <em>Yars’ Revenge</em> has a release date of September 10, 2024. They’ve also released a new trailer that covers the gameplay in better detail.</p> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Announced back in April, <em>Yars Rising</em> is a gated exploration (Metroidvania) game that bases itself on <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>. It’s a weird way to reimagine a fixed-screen shooter from the early days of home games. While the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yars-rising-is-coming-this-year-doesnt-look-very-yar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial trailer</a> didn’t really show much relation to the original beyond some visual references, both the demo and the trailer show a more distinct link. I’m talking about the hacking mini-games that are essentially new configurations of the classic <em>Yars’ Revenge </em>gameplay.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Yars Rising - Gameplay Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3EpmZ062-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">It’s a better trailer overall, though I’m still not sold on the aesthetic. I say that as someone who actually likes <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>. However, Joseph Luster tried out the demo and came to the same conclusion that he’s curious, but not wild about the game. I’m just not seeing much of a hook here.</p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true"><em>Yars Rising</em> still fits into Atari’s business model of adapting old licenses into smaller-budget games. So far, a lot of what I’ve experienced from the initiative is solid but unremarkable. However, with the resurrection of the Infogrames label and Nightdive and Digital Eclipse at their side, they aren’t restricting themselves to one strategy. It’s a lot better than what we had a decade ago when they last tried to resurrect <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/99120/Yars_Revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Yars Revenge</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/9970/Star_Raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Star Raiders</em></a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false"><em>Yars’ Rising </em>will be released for Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC on September 10, 2024.</p>
