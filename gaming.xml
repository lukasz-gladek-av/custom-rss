			<p>With each passing month, artificial intelligence creeps into more industries. That does not exclude the gaming industry, which has long used artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, the generative AI that is taking root everywhere offers much more power, and also much greater risk, compared to what gaming developers were used to. Big companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> are already laying off (or thinking about laying off) employees to invest further into artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>What do the actual developers think about this artificial intelligence revolution? Their takes, as you would expect, are quite varied. The creator of Super Smash Bros., Masahiro Sakurai, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thinks generative AI can help make large-scale development manageable</a>. Hideo Kojima, the man behind the Metal Gear and Death Stranding franchises, wants to use the technology to deal with more basic tasks while he can concentrate on the creative parts of game development and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue to 'stay ahead'</a>.</p>



<p>Richard Pillosu, co-founder of Spanish indie developer Epictellers Entertainment, shared a similar, albeit more clear-cut opinion <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Wccftech</a>, stating that there is no point in using AI in any creative endeavor. </p>



<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent chat with DayZ creator Dean Hall</a> about his studio's survival game ICARUS, I once again inquired about the stance that Hall and the RocketWerkz team have adopted regarding artificial intelligence. The game designer likened the widespread fears surrounding AI to adults 'losing their mind' when Google's search engine and Wikipedia emerged between the late 1990s and early 2000s. Then, he added that artificial intelligence is here to stay regardless of what people do. At RocketWerkz, they haven't found a need to use it with ICARUS, although Hall said they are using AI as a coding support tool for other projects. The designer reckons there's still some way to go before a more active use case makes sense, but did not seem averse to the idea. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>I'm part of that micro-generation that first had the Internet at school. It just sort of came in, and all the adults lost their minds over Wikipedia coming out and Google and it's going to be the end of information. It feels a little bit like that. I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really, then, it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is. We handcraft our maps and a lot of stuff. We like to say games are played, not made. For us, there's not really a lot of stuff that we use AI on for ICARUS because the whole idea of it is we want to sit down and handcraft an experience. That's not a judgment against AI. It's more, that's what we really wanted to do. </em></p>



<p><em>We wanted to sit down and sketch a big map out on a whiteboard and then see it come to life. Our lead world builder actually worked at Bethesda for a while and just loves worldbuilding. We do utilize AI for some of our other projects as a coding support tool. We get an AI model, expose it to our codebase, and that means you can ask it questions, which is really helpful because one person can't easily have the whole codebase in their head so that we can expose the codebase to it and then ask it questions. As to getting it actually to do work, I don't think we are necessarily quite there yet.</em></p>



<p>While actual game developers share their thoughts about AI usage in the industry, Elon Musk has thrown the gauntlet and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xai-will-release-great-full-scale-ai-generated-game-late-2026-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> that the xAI division would release a full-scale AI-generated game before the end of next year. It's a highly ambitious goal, but then again, the technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-halo-devs-call-ice-meme-despicable-%E2%80%98a-call-to-destroy-people-because-of-their-immigration-status-goes-way-too-far%E2%80%99.1337344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <em>Halo</em> meme as an ICE recruitment ad, likening immigrants to violent aliens. Microsoft has declined to comment on the twisted rhetoric, but some of the franchise’s former developers voiced their thoughts.</p> <p>The meme <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308">posted on X on October 27</a> shows Master Chief and a fellow Spartan in a Warthog with a call to “DESTROY THE FLOOD.” It was a reference to an alien species that serves as one of the sci-fi shooter’s main antagonists; an infectious superorganism that consumes and destroys everything it touches. “Finishing this fight,” wrote DHS above the recruitment ad.</p>

 <p>In an interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">with <em>Game File</em></a>, <em>Halo c</em>o-creator Marcus Lehto called the post “absolutely abhorrent” and added, “It really makes me sick seeing<em> Halo</em> co-opted like this.” Franchise veteran&nbsp;Jamie Griesemer, who was lead designer on both <em>Halo 2</em> and <em>Halo 3</em>, was similarly outraged.</p>

 <p>“Using <em>Halo</em> imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every <em>Halo</em> fan, regardless of political orientation,” he told <em>Game File</em>. “I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.“</p>

 <p>Pushing back against some fans claiming the original <em>Halo</em> games were a post-9/11 parable for fighting an army of invading religious zealots, Griesemer said it wasn’t an allegory for any specific religion or political movement. “The Prophets are not Popes, the Grunts are not Wahhabis, and the Flood are definitely not illegal immigrants,” he said. “The Master Chief is not a Christ figure and Cortana is not the Virgin Mary, I guess?”</p> <p><em>Halo</em>‘s collision with the Trump administration’s anti-immigration crackdown, <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2025/10/28/chicago-s-children-are-getting-caught-chaos-immigration-crackdowns">which includes “lawless” ICE raids in cities like Chicago</a>, comes as Microsoft is trying to get fans hyped for a remake of the original game coming next year that will also serve as the franchise’s debut on PlayStation. At the same time, the tech giant is pledging support for Trump’s White House demolition and the building of a new ballroom as it seemingly tries to curry favor for government contracts and regulatory approvals related to its spiraling AI investments.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-new-map-is-very-bad.1337338/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-update-redsec-season-1-download-free-ea-ps5-steam-2000639598">On October 28,<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s latest update</a>&nbsp;added Blackwell Fields, a new map, to the online FPS. This should be an exciting time for fans. However, Blackwell Fields is a very small, mostly empty map that isn’t much fun to play. And the community isn’t happy about it.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">I got a chance to go hands-on with Blackwell Fields</a> before it was added to the game as part of today’s larger season one update, which also added a new battle royale mode and battle pass system. And after playing a few matches on it back then, I was worried. Now having checked it out in the full game and watched others play it, I’m here to report that Blackwell Fields is one of <em>BF6</em>‘s worst maps yet.</p>

  <p>It’s an odd duck of a map that feels too big and empty when you’re running around on foot, but feels too small when you’re trying to use vehicles. Snipers are king on this map and will quickly take you out the moment you spawn. Blackwell Fields also lacks a lot of interesting spaces in which to fight, mostly just being an oil field with some hills to use as cover. Not great. Flying around the map is a pain, too, as it’s so small you’ll quickly hit the out-of-bounds and be forced to turn around. (Assuming you don’t just get shot down instantly, more on that in a moment.) And to top it all off, it’s just kind of a bleh-looking map with no real distinctive features or interesting visual theming. Brownish hills, some oil drills, a few dirt roads, and a handful of buildings. Enjoy!</p>

 <p>On the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/man_this_is_the_worst_map_in_bf_history_i_cant/">reactions</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi63vz/these_boundaries_make_this_map_unnecessarily_small/">the new map</a> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi73om/blackwell_fields_is_another_clusterfuck_lane/">ranged from “This isn’t good”</a> to “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8c4u/the_new_map_doesnt_bring_me_confidence_to_the/">This is very, very bad.</a>” Players aren’t happy with how small the map is and its oddly constrictive boundaries. People are also already tired of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi6sfk/a_quick_glance_at_the_new_map/">getting sniped over and over again</a> when spawning on squadmates, as the map lacks substantial cover.</p>

   <p>But perhaps the worst part of Blackwell Fields is that the main team bases are too damn close to each other. Players are reporting that when trying to take off in a jet at their own base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi882b/pax_armata_jets_can_be_locked_on_without_taking/">the other team’s AA guns</a>, located in the opposite base, can be used to destroy the aircraft. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/blackwell_fields_enemy_base_aa_shoots_you_while/">Helis aren’t safe from this issue, either</a>. For many, it means that aircraft are effectively worthless on the map in its current state. Yikes! Further upsetting players is the fact that the new free battle royale spin-off, Redsec, features a massive map. But the paid game got such a tiny new map.</p> <p>Can Blackwell Fields be saved? Maybe. Opening it up would help, for sure, and maybe adding some more cover would, too. But really, I think EA should have just released the other new map arriving later this season, Eastwood, which is bigger and better in every way than Blackwell Fields. Unfortunately, unless something changes, that map won’t be added until a later update in November.</p>

Send your clones on procedurally generated missions and build them into cybernetic gods in mere minutes as you cut your way through hundreds of blood-thirsty mutants, drug-addled <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inals and mechanized soldiers. Gather resources for permanent upgrades, recruit allies, make alliances, research forbidden technologies and do your best to prepare for inevitable catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You play as Morgan Lee—leader of a ragtag band of resistance fighters on a prison planet Sigma. Used to house the most dangerous criminals from all known star systems, Sigma is now locked into an endless quarantine after discovery of the Substance—an ever-adapting mass of rogue nano-bots infected by a malicious alien life form. A generation later, the planet is controlled by several factions fighting for domination.</p><p>In the beginning of the game, Sigma is shaken by an unprecedented event—a catastrophic breach of the Substance inside the planet’s only mega-city, housing not only convicts, but also management of various corporations operating on the planet. Everyone is a prisoner now. As the situation escalates and technical systems that control life on Sigma begin to fail, it’s every faction for themselves.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Structure</strong></p><p>In <em>KIBORG</em> the clock is always ticking. Each mission you undertake costs you a day, regardless of its results, and every week or so, new calamity strikes. You must choose your actions carefully, balancing risks and rewards. With your every decision, with each victory and each loss, the story is moving forward. There is no “game over” screen to see and no previous save to load. You must learn to live with the consequences of your actions.</p><p><strong>Roguelite</strong></p><p>Missions are, for the most part, procedurally generated. You never know what enemies and challenges you’ll face. With dozens of enemy types, hundreds of combat modifiers and a plethora of non-combat encounters, no mission is the same.</p><p><strong>Better Killing Through Tech</strong></p><p>Vasiliy uses a piece of future tech called The Cradle to send his clones on each mission. Even if a clone dies, Vasiliy stays unharmed. Clones are equipped with nano-skeleton, that can absorb tech from the fallen enemies and transform it into a variety of cybernetic implants. There are seven implant slots and eight possible implants for each slot. It results in thousands of possible combinations where no build is the same. And all these combinations are visual—they won’t only change how Vasiliy fights, but also how he looks—something that almost no <a title="Genres > Roguelite [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">rogue-lite</a> has done before. And as if it wasn’t enough, there are also hundreds of augmentations—invisible micro-implants that take no slot—to fine-tune your build!</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>When fists start flying, Vasiliy isn’t limited to cyber-tech only. The hand-to-hand combat is as deep, as it is brutal, with a wide variety of defensive and offensive options. Dodge, block and parry enemy strikes, mix different combos and special attacks, use your environment to devastate your enemies. Swing various melee weapons to gain a bloody edge over your opponents or just shoot them in the face with one of the many powerful firearms. But manage your resources carefully: ammo is scarce, melee weapons can break easily, defensive options drain your stamina while special strikes cost energy that you recharge with basic attacks.</p><p><strong>Take a Moment to Rest</strong></p><p>Your base is your fortress, a haven between missions. Chat with your allies (all with strong, eclectic personalities), listen in to their conversations or to news broadcasts, meditate in the garden, admire your collection of trophies, train in <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [206 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a>. Or craft power upgrades to help you in combat.</p><p>Because in <em>KIBORG</em>, the clock is always ticking.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kiborg - Nintendo Switch Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbfT2hgBvjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/kiborg-coming-to-switch-on-december-9]]></content:encoded>

<p>Don’t Nod has traditionally developed its own original choice-driven stories, so this marks the first time it will work on an existing IP. &nbsp;This game will undoubtedly be based on one of Netflix’s original properties, so your guess is as good as ours as to what it could be. <em>Stranger Things</em>? <em>Wednesday</em>? <em>Beef</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, this Netflix partnership isn't the only new project Don't Nod has in the works. It revealed an intriguing sci-fi game called Aphelion during this summer's Xbox Showcase, and you can learn more about it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/aphelion-is-a-sci-fi-game-game-about-crashing-on-an-alien-planet">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-partners-with-netflix-for-game-adaptation-of-a-major]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer poncle has released a new update for Vampire Survivors that adds Balatro characters, weapons, and more, alongside additional Castlevania content and online co-op. It's out today for PlayStation, Xbox, PC via Steam, and mobile devices, and will hit Nintendo Switch and Epic Games Store versions of the game this Friday, on October 31.&nbsp;</p><p>Courtesy of an official partnership between poncle and LocalThunk and PlayStack, the Ante Chamber update is free for all players on all platforms, and it brings four new characters to the game: Jimbo, Canio, Chicot, and Perkeo. Plus, it adds four new weapons and evolutions in the form of Infernolatro, Gros Michel, Fibonacci Seltzer, and the Celestial Booster, and you can use these new weapons on the new stage available in this update, The Ante Chamber.&nbsp;</p><p>"Enter the Ante Chamber, an extradimensional analogue of Balatro's user interface," a press release reads. "Battle buffoonish foes on a facsimile of Jimbo's home turf accompanies by a new ally, the Outer Saboteur, a silly little sidekick that steals your coins to throw them at enemies."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gB0begpTOdQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gB0begpTOdQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Elsewhere in the Ante Chamber Update are "Survarots," which are a new form of power creep that is currently being tested through Secretino in the base Vampire Survivors game, but something that all Ante Chamber characters can use. The press release describes Survarots as "vaguely similar to Arcana cards but are themed after characters from Vampire Survivors and provide different types of bonuses." The Ante Chamber features Survarots as a sort of preview before this power creep makes its way to the base game.&nbsp;</p><p>Update 1.14 also includes more content for last year's Ode to Castlevania expansion. This expansion is getting 16 new characters, with poncle promising these ones are even more obscure than the last drop of characters, a new adventure ("the biggest poncle's ever made"), 16 new weapons and weapon unions, and 12 new music tracks. This extra content is free to players who already own the Ode to Castlevania DLC, which you can purchase for $3.99. You can find more details about this expansion <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210350/Vampire_Survivors_Ode_to_Castlevania/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KW3ZFbMPD2I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KW3ZFbMPD2I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Another big aspect of today's update is online co-op, which allows players to to roam freely wherever they want without being tethered to their co-op partner on the screen. To start an online session, select "Online" from the main menu and choose to host or join a game. If you host, you'll see a room code in the top corner of the screen that you can share with friends so they can join. You can find more information about how online co-op works in Vampire Survivors <a href="https://poncle.games/vs-online-faq.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Today's round-up of Vampire Survivors news closes with the press release teasing two "BIG" updates to share very soon, one of which "will reveal where they plan to take Vampire Survivors next." We'll be on the lookout to learn what these two updates are.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <em>Game Informer's </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/vampire-survivors/single-stick-masterpiece">Vampire Survivors review</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/vampire-survivors-balatro-update-is-out-today-alongside-more-castlevania-content-and]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There is a new action RPG coming to town with ChillyRoom announcing Loulan: The Cursed Sand, which is set to come to PC and PS5, though a release date is yet to be set. Players take on the role of a skeletal warrior that has a sand form, which in turn provides some sand based combat powers to take on the various enemies that will be attacking him.</p>
<p><iframe title="Loulan: The Cursed Sand Game Reveal Trailer | PC &amp; PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tICq__wjaZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand is set in China along the ancient Silk Road where the lost kingdom of Loulan is located with its ruins piercing the sand. The story focuses on the skeletal warrior, a fallen Royal Guard, who has returned to the fallen kingdom to find his love who is also the princess. The description from the development team about Loulan: The Cursed Sand says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Cursed Warrior of Dual Forms:&nbsp;</strong>Control the skeletal warrior “The&nbsp;Cursed Sand”, freely switching between bone and sand forms to experience entirely different combat styles and story interactions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Realistic Melee Combat Against Many:&nbsp;</strong>Engage in grounded, one-against-many melee battles from a dynamic top-down perspective, where terrain design, enemy composition, and combat mechanics intertwine to test your skill and strategy.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Diverse and Creative Sand Abilities:&nbsp;</strong>Learn and wield unique sand abilities to solve puzzles, explore intricate levels, and experiment with multiple combat styles and tactical approaches.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Formidable Elites and Bosses:&nbsp;</strong>Face thrilling one-on-one encounters with powerful elite enemies and colossal bosses that challenge your mastery and reflexes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ancient Western Fantasy World:&nbsp;</strong>Explore a mysterious world inspired by the lost Kingdom of Loulan along the Silk Road, featuring diverse regions and atmospheric, handcrafted levels.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ChillyRoom has stated that it is working on planning the localisation of Loulan: The Cursed Sand into different languages, and will have more details when those plans are finalised.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Pathea Games, the studio known for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/my-time-at-portia-review-dont-make-me-leave/">My Time at Portia</a>, My Time at Sandrock, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/my-time-at-evershine-is-first-confirmed-game-for-nintendo-switch-2/">My Time at Evershine</a> has just shadow-dropped something you'd be more likely to expect from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/knockout-city-dodgeball-is-life/">Velan Studios after its game Knockout City</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-bans-bots/">Psyonix</a> as a spin-off from Rocket League with Superball, a new free-to-play 3v3 arcade hero football game that's out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced during the ID@Xbox and IGN Showcase, Superball is described as a mash between Rocket League, something that's made extremely obvious with its giant ball and arena style, and Overwatch with its hero character elements.</p>



<p>You play as one of 17 characters that each slot into one of three categories: goalkeepers, midfielders, and forwards. Goalkeepers are your slower, bulky characters that can protect their net with shield abilities while also sporting a massive long-distance shot.</p>



<p>Midfielders are your agile two-way players who can help out on offense and defense, and finally forwards are your offensive-focused powerhouses built to score goals and not much else.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Superball Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fl6qTHGwjk8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>After years of iteration, sleepless nights and many Chongqing hot summers, our team at Pathea is thrilled to finally bring Superball to players</em>," said lead producer Guo Yuheng in a press release. "<em>We're incredibly grateful to our community for their patience and for sticking with us on this journey. What started as a PvP mech combat game evolved into something much bigger and polished, when a football-inspired side mode captured the team's imagination. We can't wait to see everyone jump into the arenas, unleash their favorite heroes, and help shape the future of Superball together with us</em>."</p>



<p>Superball began its life as 'Super Buckyball Tournament,' and has been in the works since 2019 under that name before becoming 'Superball' in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1059110/view/4264427597941058609">July 2024</a>. After multiple delays along the way and player beta and alpha tests in the meantime, it's finally here for players on PC and Xbox Series to dive into. There's no word yet as to whether it'll come to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, but that's likely always a possibility at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside its standard 3v3 mode, players will also be able to check out four extra modes called Slam Dunk, Dodgeball, Icebreaker, and Divine Path. As it's a free-to-play live service game, it's also launching with a Season 1 battle pass, but a bit of a wrinkle in the game's F2P structure is that you'll only get 72 hours from when you sign up with the majority of the game's heroes.</p>



<p>After that, you have to unlock the rest of the characters by grinding for them, after using your single voucher to unlock whichever character you preferred in your 72-hour window to try them all out.</p>



<p>Superball is also available on Xbox Game Pass, though considering it's a free-to-play game, that's a fairly moot point. </p>

The PlayStation 5 and Switch versions will also be released phsysically. <span id="more-1002619"></span></p><p><em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> first launched in Early Access for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on April 10, 2024. A full release date has yet to be announced.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a challenging city builder which tasks you with creating a new home for your people forced out of the lowlands. During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!</p><p>Note: <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource <a title="Genres > Management [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn’t feature combat or any other military aspects.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build on a Mountain</strong> – Each mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability, and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.</li><li><strong>Deal With Avalanches</strong> – One of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can’t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it’s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!</li><li><strong>Craft a Transport Network</strong> – So, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons, and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges, and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town’s population, always look for opportunities to optimize your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.</li><li><strong>Raise a Summit Temple</strong> – If you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains, and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavor you’ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Laysara: Summit Kingdom - Console Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDfEOCRXx_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/laysara-summit-kingdom-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch]]></content:encoded>

<p>Difficulty levels and better checkpoints in the works</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> is a pretty good game; we should know, we gave it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">7/10 in our review</a>. But many folks have, understandably, criticised it for its often punishing difficulty and stingy checkpoint system.</p>
<p>So, to address this, Bandai Namco has announced update 1.1.0, an upcoming patch that looks to "redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy". It will focus primarily on three key areas: difficulty, movement when controlling PUCK, and the checkpoint system.</p>
<p>Here's what the full announcement entails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who played this game. Each and every one of your opinions is our greatest_asset and the driving force propelling us forward.<br>
<strong><br>
Reflections</strong></p>
<p>We developed Shadow Labyrinth aiming for a unique experience: “Wandering the labyrinth, devouring, and evolving.”</p>
<p>We sincerely acknowledge the many evaluations of the game we’ve received, along with the numerous opinions shared by our players.</p>
<p>Particularly:</p>
<p>- Inconvenience of saving / traveling<br>
- Mini-PUCK play control in MAZE sections<br>
- High difficulty</p>
<p>These were challenges felt by many players, and we strongly feel they are points the development team must sincerely address.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Version Update</strong></p>
<p>The upcoming version update is not merely a bug fix or adjustment. Its purpose is to redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy.</p>
<p>A flexible system allowing players to choose difficulty levels, and improved immersion through comfortable controls and appropriately placed checkpoints.</p>
<p>We will build the next update around those core elements. We hope you look forward to the updated version of Shadow Labyrinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we can't exactly say what "improved immersion through comfortable controls" means, the prospect of difficulty settings and more generous checkpoints will no doubt come as good news to fans.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep you up to date on when this new update is scheduled to drop on Switch and Switch 2.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">My review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> begins with a retelling of the first unexpected curveball the RPG threw my way. Barely out of the intro and having made exactly two vending machine purchases, I was offered the consumerism flaw. This puzzled me. As it turns out, this event had good reason to puzzle me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You see, since the game emerged into early access late last week - a time frame during which only those who spunked around £30 extra for the game's preorder premium edition can play it - other folks have run into this flaw, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-outer-worlds-2-dunks-on-you-with-a-consumerism-flaw-that-secretly-makes-you-stupid-if-you-bought-its-usd100-version-for-early-access-promotions-and-sales-have-riddled-your-brain/">assumed that it must be dunking on them</a> for having bought that more expensive edition.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense, and honestly I'm a bit narked with myself for not making the connection immediately. In my defense, the flaw isn't listed among the extra bits offered by the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-outer-worlds-2-preorder-premium-edition/9P65228JL613/0010/B1G720SRQH3P">premium edition</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">storefronts</a> as far as I can tell. Nor is it explicity labelled with the words 'premium' or 'deluxe', as the corporate appreciation premium pack moon man gear which has been hanging out in my inventory all 40 or so hours is. So, since my character was given dialogue which suggested them to simply be very dumb due to my accepting of this flaw designed to make fun of my superfluous spending, I guess you got me, Outer Worlds 2. Touché, Obsidian. Well played.</p>
<p>But, wait just one second. If the flaw's designed as a fun little Borderlandsy meta dunk on premium edition purchasers, it's taken on rather a different meaning in this case. You see, as is usually the case with reviews outside of instances in which companies decide not to send out codes for whatever reason, I was given an early copy of The Outer Worlds 2's all-singing, all-dancing premium edition for free by publishers Microsoft. We certainly didn't specify an edition we wanted, so as often happens it was the publishers' understandable decision to send me, a person who'd be critiquing the game and publishing thoughts, the swankiest version of it.</p><p>In 99% of cases, that boring behind-the-scenes admin wouldn't be something worth telling you about, but in this one, it's created a set of circumstances which have turned Obsidian's joke totally on its head and into something I honestly find a fair bit funnier. I promise that isn't just because quirks of fate mean it's not ended up a gag at my expense, either. I love a joke, be they good, bad, or indifferent. As long as the circumstances/company are appropriate, I'm generally in favour of firing away the funnies, even if they're tortured punchlines doomed to fall flat.</p>

<p>There's something uniquely hilarious about this one. A studio who, whether at their own behest or under duress from their corporate overlords, are doing a swanky premium edition offering the chance to play early and having a little laugh about people, er, buying that thing they're selling. Then it inadvertently pings right back around. Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDo6g4CCeU">this Faith No More cover</a> I'm fond of. After all, even if my position as a journo who hadn't bought the thing wasn't anticipated, what about folks who might get the premium edition free through the likes of competitions or just wait until sales eventually render it cheaper than the standard edition of the game is at launch?</p>
<p>I know, I'm giving far too much thought to the ramificiations of this harmless and fun little gag, but having realised what's happened, I can't help but feel it rather sums up the Outer Worlds 2 experience in a way I hadn't intended. Instead of a scenario with promise of something that could be New Vegas-level great, but to me ends up feeling closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>-level good, you get something skewered by reality into a version of itself that doesn't quite match what was anticipated or hoped. It's a lot like many of the lines uttered in jest and parody by the conniving corporatists of Auntie's Choice sounding akin to something you might find in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">very real layoff memo</a> or <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">marketing pitch</a> from Obsidian's parent company Microsoft.</p><p>Folks might well still laugh if your jokes are funny or self-aware enough, but it's a lot more difficult to satirise or mock something if you're part of it, without risking those efforts ringing a bit hollow. Especially if you're deliberately working a lot of your wink wink, nudge nudge corporate spoofing into the more expensive edition of a product you're trying to sell.</p>
