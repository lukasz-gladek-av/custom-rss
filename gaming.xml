		<p>No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I, aka update 5.0, is the first step in another major overhaul for Hello Games’ space faring adventure. This is a universal refresh that will add new technology, new plant life, new animals, and much more diversity of planet environments and types. Worlds Part I also sees improvements in the visuals and behaviours of water and the sky too. Watch Sean explain in the video below.</p>

<p>No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I has seen the water and cloud rendering overhauled completely. Water is now functioning on a mesh system which allows for more realistic waves and foam generation, while in the sky cloud coverage will vary between planets and be impacted by weather conditions. It will no longer rain if there is not enough cloud cover. The skies will be more varied with the colours of day and night based much more on an individual planet’s atmosphere. There are new frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive and toxic worlds dotted around the universe. Winds will also be more realistic as will storm effects on plant and animal life.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I, aka update 5.0, can be read below.</p>
<h3>SKY AND CLOUD RENDERING</h3>
<ul>
<li>The atmospheric and volumetric cloud rendering system has been completely rewritten for vastly increased detail and definition.</li>
<li>Planets now exhibit a greater range of cloud coverage: over time; from planet-to-planet; and in response to weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Planets with rain will no longer use the ambient rain effect when cloud coverage is insufficient.</li>
<li>Daytime sky colours are now significantly more varied.</li>
<li>Night-time ambient lighting is no longer always blue, and can vary according to the planet’s natural environment.</li>
<li>Night-time darkness levels now vary as the night progresses.</li>
<li>Night-time darkness now varies from planet-to-planet, with some being significantly darker than others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WATER RENDERING</h3>
<ul>
<li>Water rendering has been completely overhauled, and now uses a mesh-based system that allows for true wave and foam generation.</li>
<li>Water conditions vary over time in response to both local weather and the depth of the water at any particular location, producing effects from stormy seas and huge ocean swells to tranquil still ponds.</li>
<li>Water now reflects the sun and features ambient planetary reflections for dramatically increased visual quality.</li>
<li>Water colour variety has been significantly increased.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Base parts with glass now accurately render the water conditions outside.</li>
<li>Sealed underwater base parts will no longer “leak” water into the base.</li>
<li>Ships now leave splashes and trails in the water when flying low.</li>
<li>Underwater jetpack effects have been significantly improved.</li>
<li>Swimming effects have been significantly improved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Starships can now be fitted with aquatic landing jets, allowing them to land or be summoned just above the surface of the ocean.</li>
<li>A biological equivalent of this technology has been added for living ships.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GENERAL ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The shadow-rendering system has been reworked to take advantage of screenspace shadowing techniques, resulting in more richly lit planets and more accurate and more detailed shadows.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The rendering of planetary objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been rewritten and moved to a more modern GPU-based system, allowing for more objects at a better performance.</li>
<li>Distant planetary objects now look significantly more detailed and realistic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, which reduces vertex count, increases terrain generation speed, improves framerate and saves significant amounts of memory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The component system has been reworked for increased speed and improved memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Networking systems have been improved for reduced bandwidth usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Significant memory and performance optimisations have been made across the entire game, particularly in metadata usage, texture streaming, LOD generation and procedural mesh generation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>DLSS3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA technology, available to</li>
<li>PC players with compatible RTX cards, which uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images.</li>
<li>Support for the latest iteration, DLSS3, has been added to No Man’s Sky.</li>
<li>DLSS3 multiplies performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering, while retaining great image quality. Learn more on the NVIDIA site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PLANETARY VARIETY</h3>
<ul>
<li>Planetary variety and diversity has been increased all across the universe.</li>
<li>New frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive and toxic worlds await discovery and exploration.</li>
<li>Underlying terrain shapes have not been reset and existing planetary bases will not be moved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The chance of a world having ancient bones or salvageable scrap has been increased.</li>
<li>Worlds with salvageable scrap occasionally feature additional rusted remnants to collect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The wind simulation has been reworked to bring planets to life and provide a consistent effect across each world, moving trees and leaves, smoke effects, rain, fog, and snow all in a unified system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fogging and particle systems have been improved for increased fidelity and better performance.</li>
<li>All ambient planetary environment effects have been totally reworked.</li>
<li>Storm effects have been completely overhauled.</li>
<li>Planets can now have a range of additional atmospheric effects that match their ambient weather and hazard conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The visual effects for the jetpack have been overhauled.</li>
<li>The visual effects for storm crystals have been reworked and improved.</li>

<li>The Vessel of Many Mouths has been given additional ranged attacks, increasing the challenge of their encounter.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the acquisition of worm-cult story documents from the titan worm’s vile spawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>LIQUIDATORS EXPEDITION</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expedition Fourteen, Liquidators, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li>
<li>This expedition invites players to join the force of the Liquidator Vanguard as they seek to purge the universe of biological horrors old and new, including the infestations of the vile brood…</li>
<li>Rewards include new posters; custom bug-hunting trophies; a unique arthropod-themed jetpack and full set of matching armour.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All those who do their part and contribute to the community-wide efforts to exterminate the vile brood will earn pieces of the new Liquidator Heavy Exomech Hybrid, a set of heavy-duty armour for the Minotaur.</li>
<li>Among the enhancements available to the Liquidator Mech is a bespoke flamethrower unit, perfect for heavy damage at close range.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-emio-famicom-detective-club<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed what's behind the mysterious&nbsp;<em>Emio&nbsp;</em>trailer that appeared on the studio's official YouTube channel last week, and it's actually a new entry in a long-dormant (well, sort of) franchise.</p>
<p>It turns out that&nbsp;<em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</em>, to give it its full name, is the long-awaited third entry in the&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>series, which began all the way back in 1988 with&nbsp;<em>The Missing Heir</em>.</p>
<p>The first two games in the series were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-and-mages-working-on-famicom-detective-club-remakes">remade for the Switch in 2021</a>, but&nbsp;<em>Emio&nbsp;</em>represents the first completely new title in the franchise for 35 years, so it's a cause for excitement if you're a fan of detective-themed visual novel adventure games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-gameplay.jpg?itok=UPPoZUQt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-gameplay.jpg?itok=8ckW22B7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Emio&nbsp;</em>is actually a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Emio</em>'s identity as a&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>game was revealed in a new teaser released on the Nintendo YouTube channel earlier today, which sees series producer Yoshio Sakamoto (who's also known as the director of seminal classics like&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>) discussing his latest work.</p>
<p>In the new teaser, Sakamoto says the aforementioned remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>games were what spurred him on to make this newest installment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per the teaser, it's very much Sakamoto's work; he says he worked on everything from the game's visuals through to its script, its cutscenes, and "even all the smaller details".</p>
<p>He also teases the game's plot, which revolves around a creepy-sounding urban legend about girls who meet a sinister figure and agree to exchange their lives for a paper bag with a drawn-on smile. You can check out that trailer, in which Sakamoto speaks very endearingly about the project, right here.</p>

<p><em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on August 29th. You can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order the game right here</a> if you think it's the kind of thing you could lose sleep over. I certainly do.</p>

            <p>
Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die !!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.</p>
<p>Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-must-die-deathtrap">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a>, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow traps or similar.

<p>
According to monsieur press release, Deathtrap "stays true to the beloved humor, personality, and charm of the series". We can expect "witty orc chatter", "over-the-top physics" and "a strong guitar- and drum-heavy soundtrack".</p>
<p>They're also promising randomised buffs and debuffs for heroes, traps, weapons, stats and levels. Weather and time of day will further influence the odds. As for the roguelike stuff, you can choose to push forward against the hordes, stacking buffs and debuffs, or return to your castle hub to spend some points on persistent progression. The combat has apparently been tightened up, with a perspective and controls that remind me of Plants Vs Zombies: Garden Warfare.</p>
<p>It certainly sounds like an advance upon the first Orcs Must Die!, which Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orcs-must-die-review">described</a> as "about as good-natured a game as I've played this year: a one trick pony that makes the absolute best of what's a very good trick indeed." 
</p>
<p>
Alec was less keen on the second game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-orcs-must-die-2">noting</a> that it "does share its predecessor's sins as well as its successes, which means repetitive and somewhat annoying speech and music, a puddle-deep plot and an expanded but still small pool of enemy types".</p>
<p>As for the third game, I can't find a review on here. All I can find is a blood trail leading to a pit full of stakes. There is a bedraggled, desperate man in the pit who insists that he's Alec Meer, but I will not heed his filthy, Orkish lies, and nor should you. Instead, let's all head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-3f67fb">Epic Games Store</a> to wishlist Deathtrap - it launches in early 2025. Go on, go on, I swear those links don't lead to any spike pits. I'll just be standing over here, next to this lever.

A peachy pair of these controllers will be part of the grand prize in a global sweepstakes, alongside other custom Xbox hardware - <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1813559436818227580">details of how to enter</a> have been shared on social media site X.

</p>

It's in Deadpool's fetching red colour and seemingly offers a firm grip. Just mind where you put your fingers.

The winner will also receive a custom Deadpool-inspired Xbox Series X and stand, featuring his katanas Bea and Arthur - made of foam, of course.

<p>
In addition, a Deadpool-themed controller holder (by EXG Pro) will be available for the first 1000 fans to purchase an Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 on 22nd July, though only in North America and Canada.

<p>
The news of this controller comes almost a year to the day after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-pizza-scented-controller-in-collaboration-with-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">infamous pizza-scented controller in collaboration with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.

And Xbox will be keen to move on from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-rushes-to-fix-feel-the-burn-controller-promotion-following-studio-closures">"feel the burn" controller campaign</a> from May, shortly after it closed a number of Bethesda studios.

What weird ass controller could we see next?

			<p>The next game from the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku will be revealed in over two months.</p>
<p>As reported today by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-next-ryu-ga-gotoku-game-will-be-revealed-at-tgs-2024/">VGC</a>, the Japanese development studio confirmed it will reveal its next game during this year's Tokyo Game Show, which will be held from September 26th until September 29th at Makuhari Messe in Mihama-ku, Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture. Previously, the studio teased that this game would<a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-next-surprise/">&nbsp;surprise</a> fans, so it will be very interesting to see what the studio has come up with to make their game so.</p>
<p>In some ways, the latest main entries in the Like a Dragon series surprised fans of the franchise, as they did away with the brawler combat system featured in the vast majority of the series, replacing it with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/">turn-based combat system</a>. The brawler combat system, however, wasn't put to the side entirely, as it was featured in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-judgment-better-call-yagami/"> Judgment</a> series, as well as in the spin-off<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-what-is-dead-may-never-die/"> Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a>, which brought Kazuma Kiryu back as the sole protagonist.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC and consoles, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clickolding-review-impressions-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a teen, I had this unnecessary job at the town pool where I kept track of attendance by clicking a silver counter when people came in. When it was slow, I’d entertain myself by noting what number the clicker was on and then clicking back around to it. Despite the similarities, <em>Clickolding</em>, a new game by Strange Scaffold, is very much not like that.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clickolding</em></a><em>,</em> you play as a person meeting a guy in a mask in a dingy room. You need money, and the guy will give you money if you click a clicker 10,000 times. He talks, you listen, sometimes you move around on his orders, and you click.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CLICKOLDING - LAUNCH TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V62f-PsKhyY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Putting aside the embarrassment of how long it took me to get the wordplay of the title when the game was first announced, there’s clearly meant to be something sexual about the encounter, but the game isn’t prurient or judgmental about what’s brought both of you to this room, the way transactional encounters like this are often treated in games. The vibe is mostly unsettling: the guy’s weird mask, the way he asks you to come closer or move where you can’t see him, the way his dialogue grows introspective or menacing. If you, like me, are a horror wuss, it’s not scary in any traditional sense, but the tension definitely ratchets up the closer you get to 10,000. It’s a short game, taking me about an hour, and as such I won’t spoil much of what happens in it for you, since that not-knowing is key to the vibe the game is going for.</p><p>The fact that you have a goal to reach on the clicker is a good choice, the sense of a looming ending giving some structure to what could otherwise be a game about giving yourself a repetitive stress injury. You could experiment with the clicker, going faster or slower or stopping to see what the guy will do. You could invent a backstory for your character, or fill in the gaps about the guy and his attachment to this clicker. Because I am this sort of person, I had some small existential crises as I clicked, thinking about the nature of clicker games and the fact that really <em>all</em> my PC games are clicker games, and is all this clicking going to break my mouse and do PC mice have a lifespan based on clicks, and is clicking buttons how I should be spending my life. I don’t think this was the wrong way to approach <em>Clickolding</em>; despite the small room the game takes place in, there’s a real sense of roominess between the slim narrative and the one mechanic, letting you fill it with whatever you bring to the experience.</p><p>It seems like there’s more bubbling under the game’s straightforward surface–I was delighted to see players already spinning theories in the Steam forums, or <a href="https://x.com/MarioPrime/status/1813396641736523896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devising strategies for clicking</a> or <a href="https://x.com/WritNelson/status/1813432582115045754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going for records</a>. Strange Scaffold makes <em>weird</em> games, but they’re also deeply specific, doing their thing for exactly as long as they need to. It feels like an antidote to our age of sprawling live-service: an odd little game that’s just trying to be what it is, and totally worth your time (but maybe do some <a href="https://kotaku.com/physical-therapists-are-helping-esports-pros-play-more-1793007981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hand stretches</a> first).</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Last week, Nintendo did something unexpected by teasing a new game with no clues outside of a small trailer, calling it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/who-is-emio-nintendo-tease-new-switch-horror-game/">Emio</a>. Today, it has been confirmed that the teaser was for Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, the first new Famicom Detective Club in 30 years. To mark the announcement, series producer Yoshio Sakamoto has spoken about the new project.</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club – A chat with producer Yoshio Sakamoto" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpFWGeMLhjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story outline of Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club says,<em> “Junior high school student Eisuke Sasaki has been found dead in a chilling fashion, with a smiley-faced paper bag over his head.This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago – as well as the urban legend Emio, aka the Smiling Man, a serial killer said to grant his victims “a smile that will last forever”.Does the Smiling Man really exist…or is a new culprit continuing on his legacy? As a member of the Utsugi Detective Agency, you’ve been tasked with investigating the events that led to Eisuke Sasaki’s death. Along the way, scrutinise the clues and testimonies you gather for potential connections to the gruesome events of the past.”</em></p>
<p>In the game, players will have to collect clues and interview persons of interest to piece together the mystery of the Smiling Man, and solve the murder. In terms of Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club release, it seems that a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-119249/">physical edition</a> is being made available in the US, but not in Europe. The game has been priced at $49.99, and will be available from 29th August.</p>

		<p>Towards the end of <em>Waypoint</em>, we started and (eventually) finished an ambitious 101 project, where everyone on staff (plus joyous gamer and Immortality producer Natalie Watson) proposed a different video game for us all to play, dissect, and understand over the next year.</p><p>My pick was 2002’s <em>The Thing.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>I’d never played this survival horror take on John Carpenter’s masterpiece, but I'd heard a lot about it. It's known almost as much for what it <em>doesn’t </em>accomplish as much as what it <em>does</em>. It’s an ambitious work, and I call it a misfire not out of dismissal, as <em>The Thing i</em>s very much deserving of respect. As I outlined in an essay from 2022 on the experience: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgyqv4/the-video-game-version-of-the-thing-is-an-empty-promise-worth-playing?ref=remapradio.com"><u>The Thing is an empty promise worth playing.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><em>The Thing </em>attempted to turn the delicious premise of Carpenter’s film, in which an alien is able to successfully hide amongst a crew of Antarctic researchers, into a video game. A game that chose an easier path towards success would’ve made the experience entirely scripted, where every surprise was, like the movie, pre-planned. But the game wants far more, introducing all sorts of half-broken systemic elements where, in theory, a friend can become an enemy—a thing—at any time. Sometimes, it works. Oftentimes, it doesn’t. Every time, it’s really cool.</p><p>Here’s what I said in that 2022 piece:</p><blockquote>“Revisiting older games without baked-in nostalgia is already a difficult proposition, because without the fuzzy positive memories, it’s extremely difficult to situate yourself in the context the game was released in and fully appreciate what it was trying to do at that point in history. Playing games from the past requires a deft hand, because so much of video game design is specifically iterating on the past, often making it hard to fully appreciate what came before.&nbsp;<p><em>The Thing </em>had some radically cool and inventive ideas, even if didn’t know what to do with them. Perhaps the coolest takeaway from having played it is realizing that, even today, not many games are trying to do what <em>The Thing</em> attempted. It’s still exciting.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s a game that deserved a sequel, and for a minute, <a href="https://thething.fandom.com/wiki/The_Thing_II_(video_game)?ref=remapradio.com"><u>they were developing one.</u></a> While The Thing 2 never happened, we’re getting a wonderful consolation prize, as Nightdive Studios, the gold standard for remasters, is turning its attention towards<em> The Thing</em>. Hell <em>yes</em>.</p><p>I recently had an opportunity to ask some of the folks working on <em>The Thing </em>remaster at Nightdive, as I was especially curious whether they’ll try and touch up some of the elements of the game that were clearly supposed to work differently than how they function in the game.</p><p>What follows is a short chat with Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive, and Joel Welsh, art lead at Nightdive who’s worked on the recent <em>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em> remaster, alongside <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>, <em>System Shock 2</em>, <em>Killing Time</em>, and others.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsufeLmxk&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>I highly recommend checking out Nightdive’s YouTube channel</u></a>, as they’re doing some fantastic ongoing dives into their work <em>and</em> the original works.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Nightdive's remaster will include a new and more impressive lighting system. This screen shot feels a tad dark, though?</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: I suspect Nightdive is used to working on games with missing source code, broken code, messed up assets, etc. What state was/is <em>The Thing</em> in, when you decided to move forward with the project, and how did it compare to some of Nightdive’s other projects?</strong></p><p>Larry Kuperman: We had two major advantages for this project. We began with a repository of the source code, a huge advantage. And then we were fortunate enough to have run into two of the members of the Computer Artworks team, the original developers of the 2002 version. That gave us access to a tremendous amount of assets, most in high-resolution format.</p><p>Joel Welsh: I’ll echo what Larry said. Compared to games like <em>Turok 3</em>, we were extremely fortunate in this case, not to mention we had about a year of prep time.</p><p><strong>When I replayed <em>The Thing</em> a few years back, I wrote an essay about the experience that described the game as “an empty promise worth playing.” I meant that in the most complimentary way possible, because it’s such a uniquely flawed experience. Did you play the game when it was originally released? If so, what did you make of it at the time?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Joel: I played it at release. Looking back, that was over 20 years ago… One memory that comes to mind is the Rupture boss in the underground crate room right before you enter the submersible. It’s kind of a mixed bag, but I really enjoyed it, flaws and all. Working on the remaster has been a dream come true.</p><p><strong>Building on the same point, a huge part of what doesn’t work in The Thing feels like a team that ran out of time. The answers are in the game, but it just doesn’t function exactly the way it’s supposed to. See: the enemy AI, thing transformations. How do you balance trying to go in and “fix” some of these elements, while training to maintain what made the game eccentric and interesting in the first place?</strong></p><p>Joel: Assuming you mean the blood test, we’re working to resolve it, along with some of the other so-called faults of the original. By all accounts, Computer Artworks created the game they set out to make.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_P6fwckB5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Thing: Remastered Announcement Trailer | Nightdive Studios"></iframe></figure><p><strong>How much of this project is a collaboration with the original developers? And how often is that an aim for Nightdive projects?</strong></p><p>Joel: In this case, we’re working closely with Ron Ashtiani and Mark Atkinson. Stephen and Larry made that happen. I knew Ron prior to joining Nightdive and his insight on art direction has been invaluable.&nbsp;</p><p>As an aside, his work on <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>was quite good. On the other hand, Mark wrote the code for his first game at 11, graduated from University at 16, and built the framework for The Thing, along with several other systems for Computer Artworks almost single-handedly. The man is a genius. Nothing gets past their scrutiny, and we’re really enjoying the collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>To your second point, it’s important that we reach out to members of the original team whenever possible. For instance, we collaborated with Nelson Everhart for the remastered soundtrack of <em>Turok 3</em>, and Mike Lavine and Justin Chin helped with <em>Star Wars</em>. As Larry puts it, “We don’t know better than the original developers.” Words of wisdom.</p><p><strong>The Thing was a very hard game, partially because it was hard to parse and partially because it felt a little broken. What’s the fine line between trying to maintain that sense of danger and strangeness, versus ensuring a modern audience has a good time with it?</strong></p><p>Larry: We’re currently investigating ways to address difficulty and make other quality-of-life improvements. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p><p><strong>Is the concept of a “remaster” becoming blurrier for you? Remaster, remake, reimagining. At one point, it felt like a “remaster” was merely getting a game to run on a modern platform. These days, there’s more and more work going in to tweaking and updating these games.</strong></p><p>Joel: I dare say the opposite; the concept of what a Nightdive remaster should be is becoming clearer with every release. Stephen Kick has a vision for the company—bringing lost and forgotten gaming treasures back from the depths. I would compare Nightdive titles to Special Edition DVDs of yesteryears—higher quality presentation with extra features and bonus content. Merely getting a game to run on modern platforms with original assets, as you put it, is more of a port. We still do those—<em>PO’ed</em> is a recent example. It varies case-by-case, and what our partners expect when entrusting us with their IPs. For <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>, Universal has been incredibly supportive.</p>

The sparse fifteen seconds of footage showed a creepy man in a trenchcoat, wearing a paper bag over his head, scrawled with a smiling face. The vibe of the trailer immediately screamed horror, as did the unexpected age-restriction to watch it. Initially, fans theorized this would be horror developer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/layers-of-fear-review-2023-release-date-ps5-1850541040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/layers-of-fear-review-2023-release-date-ps5-1850541040">Bloober Team</a></span>’s mysterious <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project M</a></span>, but now that seems not to be the case. </p><p>For those not familiar with the <em>Famicom Detective Club </em>series, I can’t blame you. The original games, <em>The Missing Heir</em> and <em>The Girl Who Stands Behind,</em> were released in 1988 and 1989 respectively, and only in Japan. The series blends visual novel and adventure game mechanics in its stories of mystery and murder, and while they have a cult status, neither game was easily playable on modern hardware—until Nintendo released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/these-famicom-detective-club-games-have-aged-surprising-1846898388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/these-famicom-detective-club-games-have-aged-surprising-1846898388">remakes</a></span> of both for the Nintendo Switch in 2021, and released them worldwide for the first time. I suppose that should have been a sign the franchise could make a comeback. </p><p>Considering the cult status of the series, the first teaser for the game was a smart marketing move. Nintendo spent a week getting people curious about what <em>Emio</em> was, and now there are more eyes on the game than if the first trailer outright said this was a new <em>Famicom Detective Club</em> entry. Fans of the franchise are expressing their excitement in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1813560122549137533&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1813560122549137533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal post</a></span> on Nintendo’s X (formerly Twitter), but there are also those disappointed that <em>Emio</em> isn’t the more modern horror title they built up in their heads.

<p>In a new <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/bandai-namco-unveils-exciting-hands-lineup-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a>, Bandai Namco Europe revealed the anticipated lineup of titles it will bring to Gamescom 2024.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s games will include Little Nightmares 3, Unknown 9 Awakening, and Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero. </p>



<p>The event will feature “world premiere hands-on demos,” and Sparking Zero will be playable for the first time. Bandai Namco will be located at Hall 6, booth A20 for Gamescom 2024.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bandai Namco continues to generate buzz around Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero with consistent reveals. It announced the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bandai-namco-reveals-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-roster-and-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roster and features</a> last March, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-game-modes-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gameplay modes</a> in June. </p>



<p>Key characters include Master Roshi and Nappa, while the game modes feature Episode Battles, Custom Battles, and local multiplayer. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero launches <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on October 11, 2024</a>, for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>



<p>Although there’s also hype for Little Nightmares 3, the developers recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed its launch</a> until 2025. Its style is consistent with previous games, with moody suspense and striking imagery.</p>



<p>Unknown 9: Awakening is a story-driven adventure from Reflector Entertainment, where players can use abilities from a parallel dimension.</p>



<p>Gamescom 2024 will run from August 21 to August 25, and it returns to Cologne, Germany this year. </p>



<p>Although it is one of the largest gaming events, Sony recently confirmed it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-skip-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skip Gamescom again</a> for the fifth time in a row. Last April, Nintendo also announced it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-isnt-going-to-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not attend the event</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, the first new entry in the series in over 30 years, and it will launch for Nintendo Switch on August 29. Last week, Nintendo hinted at the game by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-surprise-dropped-the-scariest-game-teaser-of-the-year/1100-6524826/" data-ref-id="1100-6524826">dropping a spooky teaser.</a></p><p>Once again, the player works as an assistant private investigator with the Utsugi Detective Agency, and must solve the mystery behind the death of a student whose head was covered by a paper bag with a smiling face drawn on it. Eighteen years ago, there were similar incidents with the victims of Emio, the Smiling Man, a killer of urban legend who did the same. Along with returning series protagonist Ayumi Tachibana, the duo will work together to figure out if Emio has returned, or if it's just a copycat crime.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club | Producer Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In 2021, Nintendo released remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club games: The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, which were released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Series producer Yoshio Sakamoto is returning to handle the brand-new game.</p><p>"Both games were designed with the image in mind of a mystery movie that you progress through and solve," he explained in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHBtMQaj7w0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction video</a>. "While we were working on the remakes of those games for Nintendo Switch in 2021, I thought that we definitely need to continue this series with a brand-new game."</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/famicom-detective-club-review-the-n-e-s-murders/1900-6417680/" data-ref-id="1900-6417680">Famicom Detective Club review</a>, we said, "The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, while mechanically similar, offer pretty different takes on the detective game. Do you want to slowly unravel the conspiracy behind a powerful woman's death in a quiet village? Or, would you rather chase down a murderer in a high-octane, spooky thrill ride? The former is better executed, but both are worthwhile opportunities to dust off your magnifying glass."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-brings-richer-wilder-more-varied-universe.929613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I update, introducing "a complete refresh of the universe", increased flora and fauna diversity, and big visual enhancements, plus lots more.</p>
<p>Visual changes include new water effects with "realistic wave formations and foam generation", as well as deeper and more detailed shadows, better definition for clouds, and more. Suffice it to say that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>should now be significantly more beautiful places to visit.</p>
<p>The changes aren't just visual, though; several of the game's planets have also been dramatically transformed with new floating islands that could serve as perfect places for "bases in the sky", as Hello Games puts it. You can't tell me you've never wanted to live amongst the clouds!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=WR5R0efT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=jPNsg0br 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update promises a significant visual overhaul for the almost eight-year-old game.</figcaption></figure><p>Those worlds will also be populated by new creatures, "bizarre floral hybrids" that boast "stamen-like whiskers and petal-like faces". Just in case you weren't quite unsettled enough by what's already out there in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes, including improved wind simulation, more diverse desert worlds, and even frozen sub-zero planets with icy trees and glacial rocks, have also been implemented, hopefully bringing&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s galaxy to life like never before.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I, which shows off some of the game's new visual changes in motion, right here.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hello Games head Sean Murray has also released a deep dive video detailing some of Worlds Part I's changes in close-up, so if you're interested in the technical side of things, you can check that video out here.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not just visual and world changes; Worlds Part I also has new content for you to discover, including a new insect-themed armor set, new UI label elements, and much more. You can check out the full&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-i-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Worlds Part I is just the latest update in Hello Games' ongoing redemption story, with previous updates bringing features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update">starship customization</a>, new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-omega-update">expeditions</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-echoes-update">additional story elements</a> to make&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>a more enticing prospect.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>since its launch, it's a very different beast today, especially with Worlds Part I's visual update. You can grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/216600" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Following the Pikachu-themed Classic Clog released earlier this year, four more variants are due to arrive this year based on Gen 1 favourites Gengar, Charizard, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff.
</p>
<p>
Each design features a Jibbitz charm to go with its colour scheme, as well as Pokéball logos on the straps. I hate them all.

"This new pack promises to captivate fans of both brands, merging the playful essence of Pokémon with the comfort and style of Crocs," reads the post. "Style" seems like a stretch.

Perhaps these garish, jellified shoes are your thing, but I can't think of anything worse to put on my feet, let alone wear them in public. Pokémon Crocs, I choose... none of you.

Still, Pokémon merchandise always seems to sell well, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-van-gogh-museum-employees-suspended-after-pokemon-exhibit-chaos">exclusive card at the Van Gogh Museum caused quite the furore</a>.

Murray describes it as “S<em>tarship Troopers</em> inspired” and says players’ fight against these bugs across the new planets they explore will be “community driven” and come with a new heavy armor mech that has a flame thrower for an arm.

Some hoped for custom space stations, others guessed a complete universal reset, and a few wondered if Hello Games might finally be ready to share more information about it’s other upcoming project, the fantasy survival RPG <em>Light No Fire</em>. We didn’t end up getting a new trailer for that game, but it did come up in today’s update. </p><p>“Six months ago we announced<em> Light No Fire</em>,” Murray wrote. “It’s this insanely ambitious game. Over the last five years making game, we’ve learnt new things, and we’re feeding that back into <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. It feels like we’re bringing technology back from the future!” That’s effectively another way of saying that the new planetary features players can now experience in No Man’s Sky also act as a teaser, and potentially an early preview, of what they can expect from the look and feel of<em> Light No Fire</em>. The game doesn’t have a release date but here’s hoping we hear more about it at one of the gaming showcases coming later this year.</p><p> For now, here’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full list of every change in the 5.0 patch notes</a></span>: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h3 id="h247720"><a id=""></a><strong>SKY AND CLOUD RENDERING</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The atmospheric and volumetric cloud rendering system has been completely rewritten for vastly increased detail and definition.</li><li>Planets now exhibit a greater range of cloud coverage: over time; from planet-to-planet; and in response to weather conditions.</li><li>Planets with rain will no longer use the ambient rain effect when cloud coverage is insufficient.</li><li>Daytime sky colours are now significantly more varied.</li><li>Night-time ambient lighting is no longer always blue, and can vary according to the planet’s natural environment.</li><li>Night-time darkness levels now vary as the night progresses.</li><li>Night-time darkness now varies from planet-to-planet, with some being significantly darker than others.</li></ul><h3 id="h247721"><a id=""></a><strong>WATER RENDERING</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Water rendering has been completely overhauled, and now uses a mesh-based system that allows for true wave and foam generation.</li><li>Water conditions vary over time in response to both local weather and the depth of the water at any particular location, producing effects from stormy seas and huge ocean swells to tranquil still ponds.</li><li>Water now reflects the sun and features ambient planetary reflections for dramatically increased visual quality.</li><li>Water colour variety has been significantly increased.</li><li>Base parts with glass now accurately render the water conditions outside.</li><li>Sealed underwater base parts will no longer “leak” water into the base.</li><li>Ships now leave splashes and trails in the water when flying low.</li><li>Underwater jetpack effects have been significantly improved.</li><li>Swimming effects have been significantly improved.</li><li>Starships can now be fitted with aquatic landing jets, allowing them to land or be summoned just above the surface of the ocean.</li><li>A biological equivalent of this technology has been added for living ships.</li></ul><h3 id="h247722"><a id=""></a><strong>GENERAL ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The shadow-rendering system has been reworked to take advantage of screenspace shadowing techniques, resulting in more richly lit planets and more accurate and more detailed shadows.</li><li>The rendering of planetary objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been rewritten and moved to a more modern GPU-based system, allowing for more objects at a better performance.</li><li>Distant planetary objects now look significantly more detailed and realistic.</li><li>Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, which reduces vertex count, increases terrain generation speed, improves framerate and saves significant amounts of memory.</li><li>The component system has been reworked for increased speed and improved memory usage.</li><li>Networking systems have been improved for reduced bandwidth usage.</li><li>Significant memory and performance optimisations have been made across the entire game, particularly in metadata usage, texture streaming, LOD generation and procedural mesh generation.</li></ul><h3 id="h247723"><a id=""></a><strong>DLSS3</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA technology, available to</li><li>PC players with compatible RTX cards, which uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images.</li><li>Support for the latest iteration, DLSS3, has been added to No Man’s Sky.</li><li>DLSS3 multiplies performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering, while retaining great image quality.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHfNDBIQ1kk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> today, Hello Games finally announced the Worlds Part 1 update coming to No Man’s Sky, following a series of cryptic teases on X.</p>



<p>Sean Murray of Hello Games led a deep dive trailer for the update, confirming all of the key changes players can expect. </p>



<p>Worlds Part 1, Update 5.0, will introduce improved visuals, more planetary diversity, and a variety of new features. </p>



<p>That includes the fourteenth community expedition, where Liquidators must hunt down bugs spreading across the universe. Liquidators will also be armed with a combat mech, and corresponding insect armor. For some, it partly resembles Helldivers 2, which did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell 12 million units</a> in weeks.</p>

Featuring huge leaps in water and cloud visuals, increased planetary diversity, new gameplay features, and more.</p><ul><li><strong>Big Hunt Expedition: The Liquidators</strong> – Engage in a galactic bug hunt in <em>No Man’s Sky</em>‘s fourteenth community expedition. A vile brood is spreading corruption across the universe—join the Liquidator Vanguard to do your part and purge the rot from the stars! Report for duty alongside other Travellers to liquidate biological <a title="Genres > Horror [439 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s and hosts of giant insects in a high-paced combat expedition full of custom-balanced swarm combat. An exclusive selection of rewards await those that do their part in the war on bugs, including mounted bug trophies, new posters, and a complete set of organic armor parts forged from the bodies of the brood themselves.</li><li><strong>Discovery Renaming</strong> – Discovered systems, planets, flora, fauna, and minerals can now be renamed at any time, even after upload.</li><li><strong>Dramatic New Worlds</strong> – Planets across the universe have been transformed in wild and radical ways. Gravitational distortions have warped some lush and tropical worlds, shaking loose floating islands that now drift in the atmosphere above the planet’s surface. Hop from rock-to-rock with the jetpack or starship, build bases in the sky, or simply marvel at the dramatic waterfalls that cascade down from the sky.</li><li><strong>New Volumetric Clouds</strong> – A total overhaul of the clouds brings vastly increased detail and definition. The cloud system has been rewritten from the ground up to improve performance, fix visual artefacts, and introduce fine details such as wispy cirrus clouds and dark, rain-laden nimbus clouds. In addition, cloud coverage variety has been boosted, varying significantly from planet-to-planet, as well as over time and in response to local weather conditions.</li><li><strong>Customize Solar Ships</strong> – The Starship Fabricator now supports the <a title="Genres > Crafting [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> of Solar-class starships.

Planetary environments are now more richly lit, with natural features, structures, starships, and Travellers accurately self-shadowing and representing exposure to sunlight—especially noticeable on finely-detailed flora such as grass. Additionally, shadows cast by clouds are now calculated in relation to the sun position.</li><li><strong>High Definition Water</strong> – An astounding range of sights await explorers on water planets, as seas, oceans, and lakes now ripple and sparkle with realistic wave formations and foam generation. As well as these living, dynamic water conditions, a total overhaul of the water rendering technology also brings dramatic reflections and beautifully lit surface details.</li><li><strong>Otherworldly Life</strong> – Discover strange new creatures all across the universe. Bizarre floral hybrids stalk some planets, exploring their environments with stamen-like whiskers and petal-like faces.</li><li><strong>Full Wind <a title="Genres > Simulation [524 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – The wind system has been reworked to bring planets to life with dynamic and consistent weather. Leaves and grass rustle in gentle wind while whole trees rock and sway during storms. Smoke effects, billowing dust clouds, rain, snow and other environmental effects all go through the same wind system, for an immersive and consistent exploration experience.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Water</strong> – Bodies of water respond to the weather—ranging from glassy lakes to turbulent oceans, depending on the stillness of the breeze and the depth of the water. Violent storms can generate dramatically choppy seas and huge ocean swells.</li><li><strong>Liquidator Combat Mech</strong> – Carve through the toughest enemies in a new heavy duty mech suit. All those who do their part in the Liquidators expedition will unlock these new combat-focused components for the Minotaur. As the community purge the vile brood from the universe, plans for these parts will become available at the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion for those unable to take part in the expedition.</li><li><strong>Sub-Zero Worlds</strong> – Frozen worlds have been transformed with ice-laden trees and glittering glacial rocks. New planet surfaces as well as a significant number of new flora and mineral formations bring a new diversity to sub-zero planets.</li><li><strong>Desert Diversity</strong> – Biodiversity of sand-swept planets has been expanded, with large feather-fronded palms adorning the horizon of some worlds.</li><li><strong>Sky Colors</strong> – Step deeper into a 1970s science fiction palette with a range of new sky colors—including some especially rare hues for dedicated explorers to discover.</li><li><strong>Insect Armor Set</strong> – Complete the Liquidators expedition to earn a full-body set of organic armor. Embrace the aesthetic of the vile brood—or flaunt the evidence of their undoing—with chitinous gauntlets, spurs, mandibles, and exoskeleton.</li><li><strong>Engine <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>ments</strong> – Many underlying systems have been reworked for improved visuals and increased performance. Rendering of environmental objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been moved to a GPU-based system, allowing for denser worlds with increased performance. Planetary flora, minerals and curiosities have improved levels of detail from further distances and a broader range of angles. Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, increasing loading speed, improving framerate and saving memory.</li><li><strong>New Interaction Labels</strong> – Labels for interactive and destructible objects in the universe have been restyled and made more responsive, providing critical information without obscuring the view.</li><li><strong>Beetle Diversity</strong> – A wide variety of new insect-like creatures can now be discovered scuttling across the universe. While some of these alien insects are hostile, many species are gentle, peaceful beings. Study their natural patterns, harvest their nourishing slime, or adopt them as companions.</li><li><strong>Dramatic Storms</strong> – Exploring a planet during a blizzard or thunderstorm is more exhilarating than ever. New ambient effects and atmospheric fog combine with wind-responsive particle effects to create dramatic storms that sweep across the planet’s surface.</li><li><strong>Twitch Drops</strong> – Watch experienced Travellers stream <em>No Man’s Sky</em> on Twitch, and earn rewards! Even if you don’t own the game yet, you can earn rewards during the campaign, and claim them in-game at a later date. To sign up, visit the Twitch Drops page. Then just sit back and tune into the campaign running from Thursday, July 18 to Monday, July 22.</li><li><strong>Walker Battles</strong> – Walker battles are now framed by a detailed combat HUD, indicating the targetable vulnerabilities of these elite Sentinel units.</li><li><strong>Chitin Flight Pack</strong> – A new jetpack is available to claim from the Liquidators expedition. A fusion of advanced technology and resinous organic secretions, the Chitin Flight Pack represents the apex of bio-organic engineering.</li><li><strong>Water Color Variety</strong> – Discover oceans in a huge range of vibrant colors—from iron-rich red seas to algae-dense pools of green. Committed explorers may find some especially unusual colors on rare planets…</li><li><strong>Strange Nutrients</strong> – Brew, bake, churn and fry more than 40 new Nutrient Processor recipes from the flesh and larvae of alien insects. Impress other Travellers—or Iteration Cronos—with expertly baked Mucal Doughnuts, Seeping Pies, Juicy Thoraxes and many more new dishes.</li><li><strong>Living Buildings</strong> – Very rarely, in sectors where the anomaly field is strongest, planetary buildings have evolved legs and transformed themselves into sentient constructs that roam across the landscape.</li><li><strong>Aquatic Landing Jets</strong> – New technology allows starships to land directly on the surface of water, enabling Travellers to dive directly into the sea from the nose of their ships. Starships may also be summoned to the water for a quick escape from the middle of the ocean.</li><li><strong>Skylight Base Parts</strong> – Bring the view of the stars into your base with new skylight roofing parts. These new pieces are available for the stone, timber, and alloy construction sets and can be purchased aboard the Space Anomaly.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Variety</strong> – Planetary atmospheric effects are deeper, richer and more varied, with thick snowfall, flakes of ash and ember, heavy rain, whorls of dust, and storm crystals all visually enhanced.</li><li><strong>Vile Insect Queens</strong> – A vile brood of insects has begun to infest planets across the universe. Find and destroy their grubs and then confront the heart of the hostile swarm: their huge, hideous, brood mothers. These colossal lumbering bugs are heavily armored, and will challenge even the most experienced exterminators with devastating spit attacks.</li><li><strong>Quality of Life</strong> – A significant number of quality of life features have been improved throughout the game. The docking tractor beam at Space Stations and Freighters is now smoother; reloading can be interrupted to quickly cycle weapon modes; refiners can now be quick-filled with an entire stack of items; core technology can be instantly repaired from the Quick Menu; the range of the Analysis Visor’s Target Sweep has been dramatically improved, and much more – see the full patch notes for more detail.</li><li><strong>New Gestures</strong> – Express yourself with four new animated gestures. Browse the Quick Menu to get poised for <a title="Genres > Action [2,010 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, ponder the landscape, fold your arms in readiness, or burst into energetic dance.</li><li><strong>Spectacular Underwater Bases</strong> – Build cozy aquatic hideouts—or lavish underwater lairs—and enjoy improved views of the waterline.</li><li><strong>DLSS3</strong> – Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA technology, available to <a title="Platforms > PC [20,660 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> players with compatible RTX cards, which uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images. The latest iteration, DLSS3, multiplies performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering, while retaining great image quality. Learn more on the NVIDIA site.</li><li><strong>Vile Brood Nexus Mission</strong> – The observers aboard the Space Anomaly regret the spread of the vile brood across the universe, their queens and grubs disturbing the delicate balance of local ecosystems. They request that Travellers band together to cull these invasive species and restore balance to nature. Group up with friends or strangers at the Nexus to sign up for this new mission.</li><li><strong>Noxious Worlds</strong> – Venture into totally unexplored toxic climates. These new worlds have horizons alive with alluring but poisonous flora, while the ground underneath your feet bubbles and <a title="Companies > ooze [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ooze">ooze</a>s with living slime.</li><li><strong>Colossal Insect Trophies</strong> – Decorate your living space with a set of bughunter trophies, earned by those who do their part in the Liquidator expedition.</li><li><strong>Hungering Tendril Encounters</strong> – Test your skills against pumped-up hungering tendrils. Their Many Mouths crave the soft flesh of Travellers, and will now spit acidic projectiles when fighting at range.

                <p>A two-year-old is dead after her father left her in a car in 100-degree heat as he was "distracted by playing video games," according to court documents obtained by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/16/arizona-hot-car-death-christopher-scholtes/74431098007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. Christopher Scholtes, 37, of Arizona, left his daughter in the car as he went inside to put groceries away and play video games.</p><p>Scholtes said his daughter was sleeping when they got back from running errands, and he didn't want to wake her, so he left her in the car with the air conditioning running. He told police he "wanted her to remain in the vehicle while she slept," but the air conditioning switched off after 30 minutes, the documents say. Police are now saying the child was left in the vehicle for about three hours at the home in Marana, Arizona.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2YPsrcmkZQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u2YPsrcmkZQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Scholtes did not realize he forgot about his daughter until after his wife Erika came back from work a few hours later, the documents state. Together, they found their daughter unresponsive in the car. They attempted life-saving measures before she was transported to a local hospital where she died.</p><p>While the toddler was on the way to the hospital, Scholtes is said to have texted Erika, saying, "Babe I'm sorry! ... Babe our family. How could I do this. I killed our baby, this can't be real."</p><p>Police seized a PlayStation 5 and other electronics as part of the investigation, while Scholtes' vehicle was also taken by authorities. Authorities are now examining the PS5 and Scholtes' laptop to attempt to determine what Scholtes was doing while his child was left in the vehicle.</p><p>Scholtes is facing charges for second-degree murder and child abuse.</p>
