		<p>Nintendo has finally added Mario Paint to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, the SNES painting game considered a true classic by connoisseurs, and in a pleasant surprise, it arrives with full Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and USB mouse support in general!</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Paint - Super NES – Nintendo Classics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different modes in Mario Paint that engage different styles of early digital artistry. For beginners, the colouring book mode lets you select from a palette of colours and fill in the line art of whatever scene is before you, but there’s further fun quirks like filling with pixel art sheets. Drawing Board is then more like a full on MS Paint with different brush types to bring your digital paining into reality – it’s where the iconic Undo Dog comes from to… undo stuff.</p>
<p>Stamp Designer lets you create 16×16 pixel art, saving a small handful of these tiles that you can then combine and animate across scenes with up to nine frames that repeat and follow a path you draw.&nbsp;Then there’s Music Composition creating songs from 15 distinctive sounds, including dog, cat, pig, goose and baby!</p>
<p>All of these can be combined to create and play scenes of your own devising. The original cartridge and game seriously limits how much you can save, but with four save slots available to suspend the game in Switch Online, you can quadruple the possibilities.</p>

<p>Rounding things out is Gnat Attack, a mode where you break out a fly swatter and slap flies that are buzzing around.</p>
<p>All of this was played best with a mouse on SNES, and will be here as well. On Switch 2, you can just detach a Joy-Con 2, hold it on its side to a surface and use mouse mode, but there is also support for USB mice on both Switch 2 and the original Switch, plugging them into the dock.</p>
<p>In a nice little extra, all the music from Mario Paint is also now available in the Nintendo Music app, which Switch Online subscribers all have access to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 29/07/2025:</strong> It appears to have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mcaanu/possible_footage_of_bmwukong_dlc/">confirmed</a> that this video is not a real leak of Black Myth: Wukong DLC and is indeed just some impressive work from a fan. </p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>A video from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th2bp9e0QUQ">DonPablo Gaming</a> claims to be footage from an unannounced DLC for Black Myth: Wukong, featuring a new underwater region and a quick-time-event fight between the game's protagonist, The Destined One, fighting what looks like a hydra on the back of a dragon. The video's description also claims that more details, like when this DLC will be available, will be announced on August 20, 2025, the day that Gamescom 2025 kicks off and the day <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong comes to Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>



<p>Last year, rumors circulated that Black Myth: Wukong was set to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/">two DLC expansions</a> ahead of a sequel, with the first of those DLCs planned for 2025. After the game surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/">18 million copies sold</a> (and would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/">surpass 20 million</a>), Daniel Wu from Hero Games, the largest external shareholder for the game's developer, Game Science, confirmed that an expansion was in development. </p>



<p>But beyond that, we've not had any other official or even close to official word on any DLC.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth Wukong Upcoming DLC Under Water" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/th2bp9e0QUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Which is why it's still worth taking this video with a grain of salt, even though, through all its pixelated features, it does appear like it has a chance of being real. Especially since the video does capture the kind of grandiose encounters the original game is known for. The uploader also claims in the comments of the video that the footage is pulled from a beta test version of the DLC. </p>



<p>Is there a chance that this video is real? Sure there is. Is there a chance that someone is showing off their talents at faking this kind of footage? Always. We'll know one way or another by August 20th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-esque-light-of-motiram.1256004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has filed a lawsuit against Chinese gaming giant Tencent over the latter's open-world survival game&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony alleges is a "slavish clone" of its own&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of games.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>, the lawsuit was filed in California federal court and accuses Tencent of copyright and trademark infringement over&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which it says contains several elements from the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>According to Sony, it declined to work with Tencent on a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>spinoff game last year, and the announcement for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which looks suspiciously similar to&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, followed soon afterwards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=ff21AEIv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=gEzoLXQY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pop quiz: is this shot from&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>? (It's the latter.)</figcaption></figure><p>As part of its lawsuit, Sony is asking for damages (although the amount is undisclosed), as well as an order to block Tencent from violating its IP rights, according to Reuters. Presumably, that means development on&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>would either immediately cease or swerve direction swiftly.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow">announced back in November last year</a>. When I reported on its announcement, I said it had "strong 'we have&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>at home' energy", and I stand by that; the trailer is...well, brazen feels like too mild a word, honestly.</p>

<p>Let's just say that&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s aesthetics, robot wildlife, and tribal outfits are extremely strongly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, so I can understand the grounds on which Sony is pursuing this lawsuit.</p>

<p>You can check out the original announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>below if you want to remind yourself of what, exactly, it's being accused of stealing.</p>




<p>Tencent's proposed&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>collab isn't the only external partnership in the franchise that Sony has backed away from in recent months; back in January, it was reported that an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, developed in conjunction with&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">had been canceled</a>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether this lawsuit will materially affect&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s development, but in the meantime, you can still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist Tencent's game on Steam</a> if you want.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Gray Lady has not been having a great time lately. From its<a href="https://glaad.org/nyt-podcast-trans-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> hurtful coverage of trans people</a> to its<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/media/new-york-times-trump-coverage-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> toothless reporting on the 2024 election</a> to its<a href="https://newyorkwarcrimes.com/dossier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> feckless approach to the ongoing genocide in Palestine</a>, the once-storied newspaper of record has faced increasing criticism as to what, exactly, it thinks it's doing for a world (and readership) that's rapidly shifting on its axis.</p><p>It seems silly to hold the paper's AI coverage and longstanding disinterest in video games up to the same scrutiny as those life-and-death matters, but this is a video game website, and a recent story on AI and the games industry published in the Times is <em>so </em>bad that I think it warrants a mention, even if it’s just a footnote below the paper’s bigger problems.</p><p>Called<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/arts/video-games-artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> “The Unnerving Future of A.I.-Fueled Video Games</a>,” it's a piece from Zachary Small, a writer who’s been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/insider/leveling-up-on-the-video-game-beat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the NYT’s renewed video game coverage</a> since 2023. One paragraph in particular stands out, in which Small seems to conflate the "AI" found in video games with the same "AI" that is currently boiling lakes and threatening the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimation of entire creative industries</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Most experts acknowledge that a takeover by artificial intelligence is coming for the video game industry within the next five years, and executives have already started preparing to restructure their companies in anticipation. After all, it was one of the first sectors to deploy A.I. programming in the 1980s, with the four ghosts who chase Pac-Man each responding differently to the player’s real-time movements.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The NYT is notorious in games media circles for its apparent neglect for video game coverage; <a href="https://game.substack.com/p/why-the-new-york-times-returned-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has never hired a dedicated staff or spun off a video game-specific vertical, instead relying on freelancers, syndication, individuals and adjacent writers like Small</a>. And once again here it shows; this excerpt <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bryantfrancis.me/post/3lv2zp4bfvc2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is understandably getting dunked to hell and back on social media</a>. But as silly as that paragraph is, I take wider issue with the positioning of the story itself. Like so much other reporting on AI from mainstream outlets, it's got an almost breathless tone to it, a story built on the premise that an AI revolution is inevitable, that any obstacles standing in the way of that will be taken care of in just a few years, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>Small, <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/optimistic-cowardice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like so many other dupes in tech reporting</a>, repeatedly takes AI grifters–like “tech founder Kylan Gibbs”, who despite the vague descriptor used in the NYT piece <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylangibbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can more accurately be described as CEO of what was originally a games-related AI company</a>, which pushes stuff like AI-generated voice actors--at their word, despite their word holding as little proven value as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the AI bubble itself</a>. Small mentions “impressive tech demos at the [Game Developers] conference in late March”, referring to a succession of AI smoke-and-mirrors shows that sounded…<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well, impressive is not the word I’d use</a>. And when raising ethical concerns about the tech, he<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> doesn't speak to an affected artist or developer</a>, or anyone<a href="https://sustainablegamesalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who knows about games and their environmental impact</a>, but speaks to an academic with the title "director of responsible A.I. practice", as though there were such a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Every time I see shit like this I think about <a href="https://defector.com/toward-a-theory-of-kevin-roose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector’s “Toward A Theory Of Kevin Roose”</a>, where Albert Burneko sums up one of the biggest rubes on the beat, Kevin Roose (also of the New York Times), with:</p><blockquote><p>I was thinking about Kevin Roose, serially and with apparent enthusiasm donning each next pair of gigantic clown shoes handed to him by this or that Silicon Valley titan, and dancing in them long past the point when everybody else figured out it was all on behalf of a grift.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And I think about how after Big Tech’s successive scams of the past decade–blockchain, NFTs, the Metaverse, all of which were supposed to be just as life-changing as AI is supposed to be, all of whose mainstream hype cratered when nobody had any actual use for them–should have ruined this kind of thinking, this kind of reporting. It should have taken what little credibility Silicon Valley had left and set fire to it, and made writers and reporters anywhere near the tech industry sit up and take notice.</p><p>But it hasn’t. We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories. This newspaper sucks, man. It doesn’t suck because it posted something dumb that betrays the paper’s poor commitment to video gaming’s wider place in our culture and artistic landscape. It sucks because it’s doing to games, and AI, what it seems to be doing to every other important beat of the 2020s: taking the worst people at face value.</p><p>Anyone interested in tech, video games, AI and the points they all collide deserve better than this kind of coverage.

<p>Thunderful went through a restructuring twice in 2024, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/thunderful-announces-its-second-restructuring-program-in-one-year">second as recently as November 2024</a>. Its newest SteamWorld game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_heist_ii">SteamWorld Heist II</a>, reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/new-steamworld-game-sales-fell-slightly-short-of-thunderfuls-expectations">fell slightly short of expectations</a>. Thunderful just announced it was bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> to Switch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/acclaimed-puzzler-viewfinder-bends-reality-on-switch-this-winter">later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Atari has made a number of fruitful acquisitions over the past few years, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/atari-enters-agreement-to-acquire-night-dive-studios">Nightdive Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/atari-acquires-retro-specialist-digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a>. With Thunderful's woes over the past few years, <em>hopefully</em> this will turn out as well as these two seem to have.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it will acquire a majority stake in&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>publisher Thunderful, and the latter has also revealed that its CEO will be stepping down as soon as a successor is found.</p>

<p>According to an Atari press release, the company will be acquiring 82% of Thunderful's shares, a move CEO Wade Rosen describes as "another important milestone in Atari's development" and a big part of the expansion of Atari's "publishing and development capabilities in the European region".</p>

<p>In a separate <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> of its own, Thunderful says that it will be undergoing a restructuring operation that will result in layoffs across the studio, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">recent release&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>&nbsp;</em>selling less than Thunderful had hoped in its second quarter of the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=eYaPsEa9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=wD0LkoCp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Atari now owns a majority stake in Thunderful.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the restructuring, Thunderful says its upcoming slate remains the same, although the studio says it has been "overly dependent on individual game releases" in recent years. It's not entirely clear how the studio intends to pivot away from that reliance, however.</p>

<p>One thing that will be changing as part of Thunderful's restructuring is its CEO. Per <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-martin-walfisz-to-leave-the-role-as-ceo-of-thunderful-group-ab" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another press release</a>, current CEO Martin Walfisz will be departing the company, but he'll be remaining in his position "until a new CEO has assumed the role".</p>

<p>He will, however, not be remaining beyond December 31st this year at the latest, so we can assume that Thunderful will have found itself another CEO by then.</p>

<p>Atari's investment in Thunderful follows a challenging year and a half for the studio. In January last year, Thunderful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">laid off around 20% of its workforce</a>, and it followed that decision with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closure of Stage Clear Studios last May</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">yet more staff cuts in November</a>.</p>

In 2024, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-intellivision-acquisition" rel="nofollow">acquired its erstwhile rival Intellivision</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgeon-simulator-acquired-by-infogrames" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>IP</a> through its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival" rel="nofollow">newly-revived Infogrames label</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what its majority stake in Thunderful yields for the latter, but it's unlikely that the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>studio will continue without some major internal policy shake-ups. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The case alleges that Light of Motiram, currently in development at Tencent subsidiary Polaris Quest, is a "slavish clone" of Guerrilla Games’ original series, and seeks to block its release on copyright infringement grounds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So far, so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">Nintendo vs Palworld</a>. Except Sony’s complaint also claims that Tencent approached them in 2024, supposedly with work on Light of Motiram already underway, and unsuccessfully pitched the Japanese publishing giant with a plan to produce a new, official Horizon game under license. The suggestion being that Tencent knowingly created a game they intended as a direct spinoff or sequel, then continued with it anyway after failing to win Sony’s agreement.</p>

<p>Under US law, copyright or trademark infringement doesn’t need to be provably intentional in order for a violation to have occurred, but Tencent will have a hard time arguing that the similarities are just happenstance if Sony can show this meeting did occur. A harder time, rather, because come on, just look at it. Even if Guerrilla don’t hold the patents on combat-rolling girl protagonists or leafy far futures, the robo-tribal aesthetic, metallic beast designs, post-collapse narrative setup, and even the trailers’ wailing soundtrack work are so Horizonish you can practically hear Ashly Burch whispering puzzle solutions to herself.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Light of Motiram has enjoyed at least some degree of... if not legitimacy, at least acceptance, especially compared to similarly borrow-happy games like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306030/EBOLA_VILLAGE/">Ebola series</a> of Resident Evil copycats. Nvidia, for example, have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgFVQ8BezLg">showcased its promised DLSS 4 features</a>. Maybe that’s why Sony have taken the better part of a year to get the courts involved, perhaps having hoped it would fade into obscurity rather than sticking around as "Horizon with survival crafting" – not unlike a certain "Pokemon with guns".</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>All that said, I’m not sure that I’m actually on board with any legal book-throwing. For one thing, it all sounds rather petty for a company of Sony’s stature. Their complaint that the release of one originality-challenged RPG (that doesn’t currently have a release date) would cause "irreparable harm to SIE and the consuming public" is particularly laughable when the same document boasts how the Horizon series has shifted 38 million copies. Besides, let’s be honest, everyone copies everyone at least a tiny bit in modern gamesmaking, and arguably across art as a whole. Imagine where we’d be if even just the relatively obvious inspirations and homages were grounds for a jury trial: we wouldn’t have games like the Warhammer 40K-aping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>, or the I Can’t Believe It’s Not Warcraft that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>. And then I’d have never spent 2,800 hours of my life in the latter, getting angry at little wizard men for not hitting magic rocks when I ask them to.</p>
<p>...You know what, scratch that, sue 'em Sony. Sue 'em all.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram]]></content:encoded>

Nanahara created the beloved art for Crown Zenith’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H56.shtml&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H56.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hisuian Zoroark VSTAR</a></span> and Obsidian Flames’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.serebii.net/card/obsidianflames/199.shtml&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.serebii.net/card/obsidianflames/199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ninetails</a></span>, for instance.</p><p>So what are the possibilities here? One is that the card that’s being shown as part of Wisdom of Sea and Sky is in fact not real. The images shown on various sites are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc2ybg/wisdom_of_sea_and_sky_cards_list_full_set/#lightbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc2ybg/wisdom_of_sea_and_sky_cards_list_full_set/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a leak</a></span>, rather than an official reveal, and there’s something odd about the coloring and overlapping images on the H0-Oh card. It has that strange, washed-out look on the left and right, with the images not matching, and that certainly wouldn’t be in the final image. It could be because the card animates, and these are from different points in the animation. Quite <em>how</em> an incorrect art would have slipped into the otherwise apparently accurate leak isn’t obvious, but it remains the case that the art makes it look very odd.</p><p>An unlikely possibility is that lanjiujiu created their art after the fact, but again, no such accusation is being leveled here. It’s suggested the art was actually made in 2021.</p><p>Another possibility is of course that something untoward has taken place. It’s worth noting that the two drawings <em>aren’t</em> identical, tiny details like the curls on the Ho-Oh’s head being drawn differently and the far longer tail, which reduces the likelihood this is a rushed Photoshop fake. The prolific artist involved has yet to respond to various inquiries on their X account, although they did post a message before the issue was originally raised that machine-translates to “As expected, you won’t improve unless you draw originals.” It just doesn’t seem to fit that this artist would suddenly lift someone else’s work.</p><p>We’ve reached out to both Nanahara and The Pokémon Company to ask about the situation, and to find out if the image in the leaks is accurate to the set, and will update should we hear back.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism-1851787197]]></content:encoded>

But I do expect a superb execution of the fundamentals – speed, control, and challenge – all of which the upcoming Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is nailing down based on a two-hour hands-on demo I played. That’s not to say it doesn’t have new ideas woven into the formula, it’s just that I came away simply impressed by how this reboot plays like a well-oiled machine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven’t seen it in action yet, think of it as the classic Shinobi franchise getting the Streets of Rage 4 treatment; a vibrant and expressive hand-drawn art style that looks fantastic in stills and even better in motion. Many of the developers at LizardCube had worked on the Streets of Rage reboot, and it ended up being a great fit because it breathes life into a 2D world in a way few other games have done. A level’s backdrop can give a notable sense of scale, and the illusion of distance in this new Shinobi – what could’ve been a drab shipyard level feels immense when you see the details of huge cranes, ships, and containers in the background. And the interiors painted with neon signs and neo-modern shops and stalls fill the in-betweens with personality. A great sense of style pops in small but effective ways.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A banging electronic trip-hop soundtrack fused with traditional Japanese folk instruments also feeds into its balance of classic and modern sensibilities, vaguely reminiscent of something out of Samurai Champloo. The Art of Vengeance both looks and sounds effortlessly cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I went through the opening level that I played earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, which reintroduces series protagonist Joe Musashi as his village and clan are under attack the minute you start. His wife Naoko and understudy Tomoe are introduced as he has to leave them behind to chase down a military invasion led by the antagonist Lord Ruse and a gang of his demonic minions. You’re taught the basics like combos, dodging, wall-jumping, and special abilities, quickly pitting you against a mix of platforming sections to sharpen your mobility and combat encounters to test deftness with the blade and Ninpo specials.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance - Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This preview round, however, I cleared two full levels around the midway point, where I had a slew of new abilities and much tougher foes. I had to play both in Arcade Mode which reconfigures levels for a time attack-style version of them, and while the checkpointing was generous, Arcade Mode is all about having a seamless run to earn a high grade in the end. The aforementioned shipyard had pesky drones, guards in riot gear, and enemy ninjas with unblockable dark spells – any combination of these guys made for some tough normal encounters that can get overwhelming if you don’t know who to prioritize. And with clever but trial-and-error platforming challenges, it was a tall task to get through without death (at least on my first try). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s the flow and fluidity of the gameplay that made my time with Shinobi so enjoyable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I know that on paper, all this may sound like what you should expect from a proper 2D action platformer, but it’s the flow and fluidity of the gameplay that made my time with Shinobi so enjoyable. When I can slice a gang of enemies within a sliver of health and hit the shoulder buttons to pull off a swift and dramatic multi-hit execution, I’m pumped up like I’m stringing a series of glory kills in the new Doom games. The novelty hadn’t worn thin because, like glory kills, it doesn’t get in the way of the flowing fast action, and you get health and Ninpo energy in return as a treat. Hitting your light-heavy combos is all well and good, but when I execute my counterattack Ninpo on a dime to chop down a strong enemy’s health, I’m nodding my head in satisfaction. And Joe’s ultimate ability, which builds up through taking damage, just burns through everything on screen which was clutch in sticky situations that had me popping off when it finished a boss. Even something as simple as going from a platforming section into divekicking a foe to start my combo string in combat sequence is a small but effective thing that shows LizardCube knows what makes 2D action tick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There wasn’t any real story content to glean from these later levels, but boy, are these stages <em>long</em>. And when they’re capped off with intense boss fights, Arcade Mode can really wear you down – which isn’t a derogatory mark, but rather an indication of demanding Shinobi can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all going from left to right, however. The second level I played was in neon-soaked slums that had three sections to the west, east, and south where I had to find and save children being held captive. This stage leaned more into exploration, where connecting ziplines and jumps to avoid hazards and lurking enemies pushed me to be more precise with movement. Snipers lurking in the distance could one-shot me lest I one-shot them first, goopy slimes moving underground can pop-up for toxic damage, and those damn riot guards are a different kind of challenge in close quarters. The boss fight here was my favorite, which had me thinking more about aerial combos since he could fly across the combat arena – he also had a phase where he would heal up if I didn’t do enough damage in time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Balancing depth and approachability is one aspect I think Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is getting right from what I’ve played. I have just enough tools to feel equipped for its toughest battles, not overwhelming and not shallow. Thus, the focus is on your mastery of the toolset and reacting to some devastating combat mechanics from enemies. Since it controls incredibly smooth, and is properly paced with a speed to match its style of challenges, the fundamentals of a good 2D action platformer seem to all be here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return of our old ninja-themed action games is great to see – well, maybe it’s just this and Ninja Gaiden Ragebound (which also has Streets of Rage 4 lineage via publisher DotEmu). But in the years since both series’ heyday, we’ve seen countless others set the bar higher and higher with games like Dead Cells, The Messenger, and Katana Zero to name a few. To speak for Shinobi specifically, Art of Vengeance feels like an old head coming back to show the youngins that they still got it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’ll truly prove whether or not the series still has the juice when Shinobi: Art of Vengeance launches on August 28 this year for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-is-2d-action-done-right-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re over halfway through 2025 already, which means it’s time to check in on all of Sony’s PlayStation Studios to see what they’re making and what games are coming to your PS5 in the months and years to come. While the console has received some great exclusives in 2025, including the critically acclaimed Death Stranding 2, none of Sony’s first-party studios have released a new game this calendar year aside from the annual inevitability that is MLB The Show. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, surely that means plenty of PlayStation’s studios have games coming out soon, or at the very least have secrets up their sleeves, right? Well, that’s exactly what we’re going to take a look at here. What are the developers behind PlayStation’s highly-respected library up to now? And how long will it be before we get to both see and play their projects? So let’s dig into what each studio is doing, and when we can realistically expect to see new games from them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Naughty Dog</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog’s attention is now firmly on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a space-faring game with retro 80s vibes. After leaving the future of The Last of Us HBO show in the hands of Craig Mazin, studio head and creative director Neil Druckmann is now working full steam ahead with his team on the Uncharted studio’s first new series since 2013. But aside from a cinematic-heavy trailer at last year’s Game Awards, we’ve seen very little of this sci-fi story.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What we do know is that it stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who gets stranded on a planet when on the trail of a criminal syndicate called the “Five Aces”. It’s also rumoured to have a deeper combat system than any previous Naughty Dog game, with the reveal trailer giving us a tiny glimpse of its lightsaber-esque gameplay. Oh, and the music is being composed by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. That’s never not a good thing. Could this be Sony’s big 2026 PS5 game? We can certainly hope, but we would love to see some gameplay before making such assumptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It would appear that this isn’t the only iron Naughty Dog has in the fire, though, with Druckmann teasing that the studio has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-developer-naughty-dog-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-other-than-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-confirms"><u>second, unannounced game in development</u></a>. Could this be The Last of Us Part 3? Uncharted 5? Something completely different? Let us know what you think in the comments.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Santa Monica Studio</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Santa Monica Studio released God of War Ragnarok to huge success in late 2022 and followed up with the surprisingly lengthy free Valhalla DLC in December 2023. What’s next for the studio remains a mystery, although we do know Cory Barlog – who led development of 2018’s God of War – moved on to helm a new project in 2021 after leaving Eric Williams to fill Ragnarok’s director seat. Little to nothing is known about that new project, but given it has been in development for a number of years already, it wouldn’t be beyond unreasonable to expect to see it revealed this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for a new God of War game, well, we likely can’t expect that as quickly. Despite the gap between Ragnarok and its predecessor being only four years, the end of Kratos’ Norse saga signals a new direction for the series, which, naturally, means it’ll require a lot more work from the ground up. We can hope, of course, but don’t expect to see everyone’s favourite angry dad any time soon. That said, we wouldn’t say no to a remake of the original trilogy…</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Insomniac Games</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac is arguably Sony’s most prolific studio, having released either a Spider-Man or Ratchet and Clank game every couple of years for almost a decade now. Its most recent launch was in 2023 with the hugely successful Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and so – based on pattern – you’d be forgiven for expecting a new Insomniac game in 2025. But in a worrying sign of the fragile state of the games industry, even a game of Spider-Man 2’s magnitude couldn’t prevent layoffs from occurring last year. That capped off what turned out to be a doubly damaging couple of months for the developer, following a huge data breach and subsequent theft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The data theft revealed that the studio’s highly anticipated Wolverine game is not expected until 2026 at the earliest, but also that a Venom game may arrive before it. Either way, it’s highly unlikely Insomniac will be springing any surprise games this year, and after all the studio has gone through recently, I think it's fair to allow it as much of a break as anyone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Sucker Punch Productions</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch is following up 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima with Ghost of Yotei, scheduled for an October 2, 2025 release. As showcased in a recent State of Play stream, the standalone sequel takes us to Hokkaido on a revenge quest to deal with the “Yotei Six” — the murderers of protagonist Atsu’s family. With a non-linear quest structure and more varied arsenal, it's looking set to be a true evolution of Tsushima’s open-world foundations.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei State of Play July 2025 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Guerrilla Games</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Guerrilla followed up 2022’s Horizon: Forbidden West with the Burning Shores DLC one year later as it continued to build out Aloy’s story. With the West Coast-set sequel ending on a cliffhanger, it’s not a stretch to expect the Amsterdam-based studio to be working on the third part of the trilogy next. We wouldn’t expect any news on that one soon, however – the development time between Zero Dawn and Forbidden West was five years, so we’re likely a little while away from seeing Aloy and her metal dinosaur friends again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we’re reportedly more likely to see first is a live service Horizon game that is currently in the works, starring “a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look”. Perhaps this is something we can hope to see more of sooner rather than later, although this year may be a stretch, with Sony perhaps reassessing their live service future following the failure of Concord and the troubles facing Marathon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Housemarque</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finnish developer Housemarque is following up 2021’s Returnal with Saros, another sci-fi action game. Starring Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, players will be taken to a lost off-world colony on the planet Carcosa in order to investigate its mysteries. An evolution of Returnal’s roguelike rhythm, it's set to deliver Housemarque’s trademark challenging shooter combat when it arrives on PS5 sometime in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Haven Studios</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally due for release this year, Haven Studios’ multiplayer shooter Fairgames is now expected in the Spring of 2026. It’s not been smooth sailing for another of Sony’s planned live service offerings, with Jade Raymond — who only founded the studio in 2021 — leaving the project earlier this year. Work is still ongoing on the online heist game, though, but with little to nothing seen of it since the 2023 cinematic trailer reveal, we’re left waiting to see what its gameplay actually looks like.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Bend Studio</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Bend has been pretty quiet since the release of Days Gone way back in 2019, aside from giving us a remaster a couple of months back. But in 2022, a few slithers of detail were revealed about what the Oregon studio is currently working on. It shared that its new game will “build upon the open-world systems of Days Gone” but won’t be announced until “the time is right”. Apart from knowing it won’t be a continuation of Deacon St. John’s story, we really know nothing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a rocky year for the developer so far, with reports that a live-service game it had been working on had been scrapped by Sony, as well as layoffs impacting 30% of the team as it transitions to its next project. Whether this new game the reduced headcount is working on has anything to do with those details revealed three years ago, or if the studio is starting again from scratch, is unknown. Either way, we wouldn’t expect to hear anything soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Media Molecule</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Media Molecule spent most of the past decade working on Dreams, the game creation and curation project that was released in 2020. But as a result of significant layoffs at the studio in 2024, live support for the game has now ended, with MM’s current aim being to ensure “Dreams transitions into a self-sustaining platform”. There has since been no news on what the developer’s next project will be.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Team Asobi</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Asobi gave us one of 2024’s biggest games with the charmingly creative platformer Astro Bot. An ode to PlayStation history, it won many awards and cemented itself as one of the PS5’s very best offerings. Since then, the Japanese studio has continued to support it with regular updates and levels as recently as this summer. But what next? Well, we wouldn’t be surprised to see another Astro game on the way, given the critical and commercial success of last year’s hit. There’s certainly no shortage of obscure PlayStation characters left to sprinkle through more of those colourful levels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Bluepoint Games</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the success of both the Shadow of the Colossus and Demon’s Souls remakes, Sony acquired Bluepoint Games as a first-party studio in 2021. We don’t know what its first project since joining the PlayStation Studios family is, though, but we do know that the developer has expressed its desire to create an original game, rather than reimagining another classic. Perhaps we could see a reveal soon, but seeing as Sony confirmed that a live service game, which was reportedly set in the God of War universe, was cancelled at the studio earlier this year, it seems unlikely. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Polyphony Digital</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Polyphony has been making Gran Turismo for 25 years now, so it would certainly be a shock to see it veer from that path in the near future. GT7 came out around three and half years ago now, meaning maybe the time is approaching for the reveal of the studio’s next racing sim.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>San Diego Studio</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, San Diego is well established as the MLB The Show studio. This year’s entry only dropped in March, so we can expect to see another next Spring if history is anything to go by.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Firesprite</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Firesprite most recently developed Horizon: Call of the Mountain for PSVR 2, following the studio’s new-found focus on VR games. What’s next is anyone’s guess, however. A new VR game would be the educated guess, but given Sony’s lack of commitment to creating games for its second-generation headset, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the UK studio pivot to something more traditional. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Recent reports discussing layoffs and unrest at the developer suggested that Firesprite was working on a live-service Twisted Metal game, which has since been canceled. It’s currently believed that the studio is now working on a new game called Project Heartbreak. Details are thin on what this is, though, and so we have no idea of when we can expect to see it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>teamLFG</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Formed earlier this year as part of PlayStation Studios, teamLFG was spun out of Bungie to create a new team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and "frog-type games”. As to what a frog-type game is, your guess is as good as ours, but the project has been described as letting players “inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in a brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe”. This one doesn’t seem too far along the production pipeline, though, so we aren’t expecting to hear more anytime soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u><strong>Dark Outlaw Games</strong></u></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new PlayStation studio for 2025, Dark Outlaw Games is led by Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell. Very little else is known about this team or what they’re working on, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s everything we know about upcoming first-party PlayStation games, and the truth is that very few release dates look to be coming up quickly. Of course, this can and likely will change soon, and with GTA 6 looming on the horizon in 2026, it does make sense that many publishers are waiting for Rockstar to unleash their powerhouse before they make their own moves. That said, that doesn’t prevent 2025 from still looking relatively empty when it comes to PS5 exclusives. Let’s hope that the outlook will look a lot brighter soon, not only for players waiting for new games to play, but for the developers who work so hard to deliver them to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

                <p>Activision is making a key change to Call of Duty HQ, the launcher that houses the latest Call of Duty games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the recent Unreal Fest 2025 in Orlando, Florida, Senior Unreal Engine Software Engineer Ari Arnbjörnsson gave a talk dedicated entirely to PC gamers' nightmare: stuttering.</p>



<p>Over the last few years, we have had to report far too many times that newly released Unreal Engine games (but not only them, to be fair, as other engines are also affected) were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-pc-stuttering-is-unbelievably-bad-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagued by stutters and hitches on PC</a>. All the while, we asked ourselves: what is Epic doing about it?</p>



<p>That's essentially the primary focus, alongside best practice advice to developers, of the aforementioned talk, aptly titled 'The Great Hitch Hunt', where Ari Arnbjörnsson dressed in a witch hunter costume and encouraged fellow developers to 'kill the hitches'.</p>



<p>Arnbjörnsson identified seven primary causes of hitches and stutters. The first one, Level Streaming, is really more of a category that includes a family of hitches related to loading or unloading parts of game worlds. According to the Unreal Engine engineer, a common cause is the misuse of static mesh actors for static geometry. Oftentimes, artists and level designers drag in many static mesh actors, such as tables, books, cutlery, etc, which is fine for small games but potentially disastrous for big or AAA-sized worlds because they bring overhead, require memory load, and have to be scanned by the garbage collector. </p>



<p>Arnbjörnsson recommends using instanced static meshes (ISMs) or hierarchical instanced static meshes (HISMs) instead. The packed level actors feature can also be deployed to combine many static meshes into fewer actors, reducing overhead. The engineer then switched to what Epic is doing to improve level streaming hitches, such as the experimental Unreal Engine 5.5 Cell Transformers feature that converts static mesh actors into instanced meshes at runtime and the experimental streaming performance improvements introduced with <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>. Experimental features aren't turned on by default but will be once they're ready. </p>



<p>The second cause of hitches is actually Physics, because content teams tend not to optimize for them. The introduction of Nanite with Unreal Engine 5 made developers believe they could simply drop in complex meshes in their worlds and they would magically work without problems, but that isn't so. Simple collision shapes should be used instead of complex physics whenever possible, in this order: spheres (fastest), capsules, boxes, and (very last) convex polygons. Distant objects that cannot even be interacted with should be completely disabled. The Chaos Visual Debugger can further help with profiling performance issues caused by physics. </p>



<p>Regarding Epic's ongoing work in this area, Arnbjörnsson pointed to the Async Physics Initialization available in Unreal Engine 5.5/5.6, which is also still experimental. This offloads the physics calculation off the game thread, but the engineer recommended not to ship with it yet. He also warned that it could be counterproductive in that it could seemingly fix the problem until the physics scene grows up to the point that the problem returns even worse. Managing how large a physics scene should be remains a high priority for developers. Epic also continually improves Chaos physics with better multithreading and other optimizations.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Then there's the Actor Spawning hitch: complex actors with many components (skeletal meshes, animations) like characters can take several milliseconds to spawn, causing noticeable frame drops, especially if many spawn at once. Advices include limiting how many actors spawn per frame, delaying initialization of components like skeletal animation to run asynchronously after spawn, and pooling actors when possible instead of destroying and creating, and reusing hidden actors.</p>



<p>Arnbjörnsson said that several developers asked Epic to implement actor pooling as a standard Unreal Engine feature. While this is being investigated, it's very hard to actually make it happen, given that they'd have to support every single actor type for every single project in every single industry (Unreal Engine isn't just used by game developers nowadays). For now, developers should rather build custom pools per actor type.</p>



<p>The fourth one is perhaps the most common instance of stutter in PC games: Pipeline State Object (PSO) compilation. Modern low-level APIs like DirectX12, Vulkan, and Metal require fully compiled shaders before rendering. This is not an issue for consoles since they all have the same hardware configuration. However, shipping all compiled permutations is impossible on PC and mobile devices, and compiling shaders on the fly inevitably causes the hitches. Games have been trying to precompile using a bundle PSO cache, but it’s imperfect and hard, especially for open worlds or procedural content.</p>



<p>PSO precaching has been introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-3-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Unreal Engine 5.3</a> and should always be used, but it's not enough on its own. Arnbjörnsson urged developers to prepare their own PSO compilation strategy and also to profile their games with the PSO Cache Buster plugin he created (it's available for download <a href="https://github.com/Flassari/PSOCacheBuster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>). Epic is still working to improve PSO precaching further. They have now caught all code paths for the major Unreal Engine sample projects and Fortnite. </p>



<p>The fifth cause is the Garbage Collection hitch. That happens when there are too many unused UObject instances, causing the Garbage Collector to take too long and provoke stutters. Developers should therefore endeavor to keep UObject counts manageable and strategically schedule GC to avoid hitch spikes. Epic's engineers are working on the currently experimental Incremental Reachability Analysis feature to spread the Garbage Collector's work over multiple frames, as well as focusing on multi-thread safe incremental GC for client builds in the future.</p>



<p>The sixth is called a Synchronous Loading Hitch, and it occurs when blocking (synchronous) assets loads stall the game thread until the asset finishes loading, causing very long hitches. Under no circumstances should this be allowed - only asynchronous loading should be used. Asset validators (like Arnbjörnsson's <a href="https://github.com/Flassari/CommonValidators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CommonValidators</a>) can catch blocking load usage, and some studios even outright removed blocking load nodes from blueprints. For its part, Epic is adding warnings and tools in the Unreal Engine to inform users about blocking loads. Still, if one sneaks through, UE5.4/5.5 introduced the ability to partially flush async queues to reduce hitch impact. </p>



<p>Last but not least, there are the Blueprint and Content Hitches that are caused by developers doing too much work in blueprints or content scripts, such as too many timers, too many tick updates, bloated sequences, or audio/skeletal animators overloading the system. Examples of fixes on the developer's side include faking or simplifying distant objects and turning off unnecessary ticking and timers. For its part, the Unreal Engine maker continues expanding the Unreal Insights tool with better usability and features like region marking and screenshots to make it easier for developers to visualize and optimize performance.</p>



<p>In a closing note, Arnbjörnsson reminded all game developers that despite the many advancements in hardware and software, game development still has to embrace limitations. As such, hard optimization work and clever 'faking' are still very much necessary to get the best results. Hopefully, the talk will open the eyes of developers to this rampant issue and make our game experiences much smoother.</p>

Our <em>Grounded 2</em> preview dives into the Early Access content, including the first part of the main story.</p>

<h2>Re-Shrunk Adventure |&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2&nbsp;</em>Preview</h2>

<p><em>Grounded 2</em> takes place two years after the end of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16760b76-971f-4c46-a042-33960bad2295" href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, but that doesn't mean you need to play the original. The game starts with a cinematic intro exploring the ending of the previous title. It then shifts to the current day, the unveiling of a commemorative statue in Brookhollow Park by Ominent. After a mishap during the ceremony, you awake to find yourself shrunk...again. This kickstarts your adventure in the park, a larger expanse of wilderness with new bugs and new threats waiting for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-2-snackbar-ranger-outpost.jpg?itok=qfZimLyg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-2-snackbar-ranger-outpost.jpg?itok=kzNOF-pY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For fans of&nbsp;<em>Grounded,&nbsp;</em>you'll be pleased to know the gameplay and mechanics of the sequel are generally the same. You gather resources like grass, weed stems, sap, etc., to construct your base. You Peep on bugs to learn more about their nature and how to defeat them. There are Milk Molars to increase your stats and Mutations to unlock as you play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main differences come in the inclusion of new buildings, new bugs, being able to tame and ride some creatures, as well as the new storyline, which brings its own pint-sized villain out to play.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Combat Focused Villain</h2>

<p>The main story kicks off with BURG.L having his head yanked off. Sending a plea for help, you're aware of a woman who's holding his, now shrunken, head captive. Making it your mission to fix BURG.L and return to your normal size, you set out to explore the park with the help of Ominent's new leader, Ms. Beaumont.&nbsp;</p>

She sends her mind-controlled O.R.C. bugs to attack you repeatedly, testing if you've gone soft in the two years since being originally shrunk. This tête-à-tête is what fuels the different main quests, bringing you to the unique regions of Brookhollow Park. We're left on a cliffhanger at the launch of Early Access, with more story promised as the game continues development. It's the perfect ending spot, giving you enough game to feel satisfied, but hooking you in for future updates and continued gameplay.</p>

<h2>The Joy of Riding an Ant</h2>

<p>Instead of having to walk or glide everywhere, you can now tame Red Ant Soldiers. You can have up to five ant buggies that you can ride. They aid in combat when you're not mounted, can enlist the help of a nearby Red Ant Worker, and make quick work of grass and dandelions. You're able to haul up to 12 items at a time, increasing the speed of building dramatically. Your ant can go fast, getting you from one place to another quickly by running around the map. It does have a stamina bar, but it generally rapidly refills. This makes fleeing from difficult battles far easier.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-2-red-ant-soldier-buggy.jpg?itok=5z5lA0XR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-2-red-ant-soldier-buggy.jpg?itok=Fic3keXa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of that, riding your ant into anthills negates any hostility from other soldier ants. Their aggression triggers as soon as you get off your buggy, but you can greatly reduce the number of combat encounters you have while exploring by simply being on top of your ant.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>All the Bugs</h2>

<p>There are a few new bugs introduced in&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>'s Brookhollow Park. You'll come across Cockroach nymphs, Cockroaches, and two boss roaches. Three varieties of the Northern Scorpion will pop out of the dirt to wreck you with pincers and venom. You'll come across Blue Butterflies and Praying Mantis Nymphs. Garden Snails, as well as their Baby version, are new Harmless creatures.</p>

<p>This is in addition to fan favorites like the Red ants, Aphids, Gnats, Weevils, and Ladybugs. The spider population as of EA launch is far less varied, featuring Spiderlings, Orb Weaver Jrs., Orb Weavers, and the occasional Wolf Spider. For those who prefer not to see eight-legged creatures in their game, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f31c37a3-768e-4429-a7f7-72c8261b0883" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/grounded-preview" rel="nofollow">Arachnophobia mode</a> is still available.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frozen-willow-facing-northern-scorpling-grounded-2.jpg?itok=-vjgqDKO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frozen-willow-facing-northern-scorpling-grounded-2.jpg?itok=g6-7vdn5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Same Ol' Base Building</h2>

<p>Even though there are new buildings you can construct and new crafting recipes to make, the mechanics of setting up your base are the same. You select a piece from the wheel, place it where you want, then supply the materials until it's complete. More unusual structures can be introduced later on in EA, but there's not too much that sets this apart.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More to Come</h2>

<p>While there's already a decent amount of content to get through, especially if you want to gather all the hidden items and collectibles, only about a third of the Brookhollow Park map is accessible. I spent roughly 35 hours exploring most areas available, finding Milk Molars, and getting through Ranger Challenges, along with completing the main story. It can be assumed that there'll be a similar amount of content for the rest of the map, giving players an estimated 100 plus hours of gameplay. That's quite a bit of gaming for the current price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2&nbsp;</em>is fun to play and gives plenty for the cost, there are a number of bugs and glitches that can get in the way. Some of the largest issues I had were:</p>

<ul><li>Game crashes</li>
	<li>Dropped loot disappearing into the environment, making it unable to be collected</li>
	<li>Buggy getting stuck in the ground, unable to be recalled to the nest or follow you around</li>
	<li>Bugs spawning in the environment, but still being able to attack you without you being able to attack back</li>
	<li>Resting/Saving/Building being disabled due to combat in progress even after combat was over</li>
</ul><p>Not all of the above were so impactful as to stop game progression, but were certainly frustrating and caused delays, whether due to lost data, lost resources, or being unable to complete alternate objectives. Other issues include Spiderlings not spawning when nests are destroyed, Orb Weavers floating from spot to spot (usually in the air), creatures being able to get into your base through your walls (like ants and snails), and a delay when throwing bombs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>&nbsp;is a great game that has a well written and intriguing storyline. Fans of the original will definitely want to pick up the sequel. However, some of the bugs that can occur definitely cause frustration and crashes negatively impact the experience. If you don't want to deal with these issues, or rather have the whole story to play through at once, it'd be better to wait until the game fully launches. For all others, I definitely recommend checking&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>&nbsp;out, even if you didn't play&nbsp;<em>Grounded.&nbsp;</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Warner Bros. Games aren't pushing the brakes on games with live service elements any time soon, despite the whole Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League debacle. A new job listing at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> studio WB Games Montréal suggests their upcoming game will have at least some of those long-term servicey bits to it.</p>
<p>Or, at the very least, its executive producer will need to be someone who knows what live services are and can do some live service strategising.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/">executive producer listing</a> is looking for a senior dev to "lead the development of a high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalog". The duties which'll come as part of that involve a need to "oversee all phases of development, from concept to post-launch live operations."</p>
<p>Things get a tiny bit more specific about that last bit further on, mentioning the successful applicant needs to have a hand in "post-launch content and live service strategy" designed to keep players engaged long-term. "Deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services," is also listed in the qualifications and experience section, in case those previous examples aren't enough mentions of the L and S words for you.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. write that they're keen to see that the game "not only meets its goals but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible within the WB and DC universe", which could well just be job advert speak, but the explicit emphasis on a need for "critical and commercial success" that accompanies it is a noteworthy given the context.</p>
<p>If this project does turn out to be a live service-focused DC game, it'd be following in the footsteps of notorious flop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. In case you need a refresher, that game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-its-publisher-says">failure</a> saw it miss its financial targets and become the poster child for a tough period at Warner Bros. Games that eventually led to this year's reshuffling at the publisher, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego all being shuttered</a>.</p>
<p>There've also reportedly been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">rounds</a> of layoffs at developers Rocksteady over the past year, because this is the games industry.</p>
<p>ARPG Gotham Knights, while not a hugely high-profile failure like Suicide Squad, ended up attracting mixed reviews at debut in 2022. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gotham-knights-review">Our Ed</a> said it contained "the tiniest shreds of goodness", but confessed to not wanting to play more of it once he was done reviewing. Our Edwin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gotham-knights-is-on-game-pass-and-who-knows-it-might-surprise-you">a bit more of a fan</a>.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that if the Montréal studio are being saddled with the need to do a live service - possibly to counteract what's left of Rocksteady being permitted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report">go back to singleplayer</a> by Warner's corporate overlords - they're at least spared the sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">bad time it sounds like the latter group of devs had</a> creating their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">big, confused online thing</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-suicide-squads-fate-warner-bros-look-set-to-have-gotham-knights-devs-make-a-live-service-game]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has had a rough time of it since launch. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-related-pc-improvements-coming-this-week-says-capcom">From day one</a>, players on PC in particular have been criticising the game's performance (though that was recently addressed, to some degree, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-finally-fixes-the-games-inexcusable-performance-woes-on-pc">with a much-needed patch</a> that took aim at stuttering and shaders). But aside from the complaints about performance, faithful hunters have also been knocking the game's approach to difficulty and content variation, bemoaning the easy hunts and comparative lack of end-game content.</p>
<p>Today, in a post over on X (formerly Twitter), Capcom has released a surprising statement that notes the developer will actually move various items <em>up</em> the roadmap to better placate players that have issues with the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156">In a post</a> that addressed the release date and content of update Ver.1.021, Capcom notes:</p>
<p>"The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update."</p>
<p>As such, the update (which was initially planned to launch 'early August') will now drop closer to mid-August, and is currently being readied for deployment on 13th August.</p>
<p>The main content added to the game in this update will include: a new level of quest difficulty (hopefully making things just that little bit tougher for series veterans), a new rewards system for these end-game quests (this will be realised in the form of Talismans that players can equip, which will carry random skill combinations - ideal for depth and variety in build-crafting), weapon balance adjustments (that will cover more weapons than originally planned for this update), and other improvements and adjustments (dare we say: better performance?)</p>

</figure>
<p>It's nice to see the developer responding to the criticism about the game in this manner. I spoke recently about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">the impact the game's negative reviews have been having</a> on the title, and it seems Capcom is keen to demonstrate that it's listening to fans by being fluid with its development pipeline in this way. As for what this increased difficulty is, though, we've no idea at the time of writing. Will it just be harder versions of the Apex monsters, the Gore Magalas, and boss-monster Arkveld, with higher damage output and more tanky HP? Or will it be something a little more meaningful?</p>
<p>I, personally, am hoping for more stagger resistance for lower-tier monsters, since the weaker monsters seem to be incapable of getting out of stunlock if seasoned players pepper them with the right attacks in the right places. A smart move would be to provide 8* versions of the overall monster roster, bringing the 'chaff' monsters up to par with some of the super-powered end-game beasts that have been added to the title post-launch. I think this would efficiently nail both content variation and difficulty concerns in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>As the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-series-helps-capcom-achieve-12th-consecutive-year-of-increased-profit">continues to help Capcom meet various sales targets</a> (and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month"> perform incredibly well</a> in its own right), the optics of the developer listening to fan feedback and attempt to rectify launch window wobbles is certainly welcomed. The rest of the roadmap - which, currently, runs until 'this winter' - promises more monsters and even more 'challenging hunts', something that the community has been gnashing for since it put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">Seregios and Lagiacrus</a> to bed at the beginning of July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode will impact performance so much, especially with reduced memory bandwidth, that it's unlikely that better power efficiency is its only goal</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the upcoming Power Saver mode that has already been introduced to the system with a beta system software update, highlighting how the stated goal of improving the system's power efficiency is unlikely to be the main goal of this new mode for a few reasons. For starters, some of the rumored limitations it brings, such as significantly reduced memory bandwidth, will impact the system's performance a lot, so much so that the most demanding games will run poorly in Power Saver mode without the developer's intervention, and asking developers to target this mode also seems to be quite a lot to ask, if power efficiency is the only goal. Even looking from a user's perspective, the PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode doesn't make a lot of sense, according to Digital Foundry, as it's very unlikely someone would gimp their systems just to have minimal savings on energy bills, with the expected minimal difference in terms of power efficiency.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, how Microsoft has handled power efficiency for its Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is another strong indication that the PlayStation 5 Powr Saver mode's main goal is something other. In Fortnite, for example, Microsoft introduced some tweaks to save power without requiring developer intervention, such as reducing the framerate of the game's main menu to save power if the system is left idling, and changing the game's dynamic resolution scaling with no impact on the experience. As such, having an entire system setting to address power efficiency seems to force a lot of work on developers for very little gain for the end user.</p>



<p>As such, Digital Foundry thinks this new PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode is being introduced to provide developers with some specs targets for a future device. A low-power PS5 in the vein of the Xbox Series S seems very unlikely this late in the generation, and the reduced memory bandwidth is a strong indication that Power Saver mode has, as rumored, some relation with a possible <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">future handheld system.</a></p>

<p>Besides introducing Power Saver mode, which currently cannot be tested as no game supports this new setting, the new PlayStation 5 beta firmware introduces some welcome new features, including the ability to pair DualSense controllers with multiple devices at the same time.

            The human world is a tedious place consisting of grocery trips, laundry and tax returns, so let's all go be janky-ass wolves. We shall coordinate to bring down elk amidst the engulfing winter snows of the Yellowstone Caldera, duel with cougars under starbound skies, and do adorable bellywiggles in what is possibly our own poop, though I'm not sure if the simulation covers the entire lupine digestive cycle. If that's not enticement enough, we can do some wolf sex and raise a litter of cubs together. We shall manage our cubs by means of leather spreadsheets that look like they were recently mauled by hungry, horny wolves. </p><!--more-->
<p>WolfQuest! The very name huffs and splutters the same spirit of tacky adventure I once inhaled from shareware CD game compilations back in the 1990s. You know, that glorious epoch when you could just slam together two random words around a capital letter and really bottle the lightning. CheeseWang! HatShoe!</p>
<p>This isn't quite that old: I gather that the original concept for WolfQuest is from 2005. It's an open world simulation with a pronounced educational component (yes, there <em>is</em> a wolfopedia) set in the Yellowstone National Park. Developers eduweb have just released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/926990/WolfQuest_Anniversary_Edition/">anniversary edition</a> out of early access, and I am writing about it because this is precisely the morale boost I need in a week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">staff departures</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">calibrating the acceptability of pseudo-incest</a>. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>It speaks terribly for my state of mind that I am still laughing at the bit in the trailer when one of your pups gets stolen by an eagle. Ah dang, that's the third one this week! It also speaks terribly of my state of mind that I can't stop laughing at this line on the Steam page: "Build a pack and raise pups year to year in a special 2-Player Mode, until one of you dies of old age." In the game, yes? In the game, right, eduweb?</p>
<p>I also can't stop laughing at the mention of an "IronWolf" mode. I know they're referring to permadeath in XCOM, but come on, tell me that there isn't something innately hilarious about an iron wolf. Let's see those fucking eagles fly off with that one! Who's top of the foodchain now, you godless skyweasels? I'll bellywiggle on your grave.</p>
<p>I am going to have an extended cackle in the cupboard and see if I can get it all out of my system. While I'm away, here are some bullet points to answer any WolfQuestions you might care to ask.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Live the life of a wild wolf! Form your own pack and watch your adorable pups grow into adults and disperse, year after year, until your wolf dies. End your story on your deathbed, or select an heir to continue your legacy.</li>
<li>Dynamic day/night, weather and seasons immerse you into the wilderness.</li>
<li>Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations. Packmates and pups interact and play with each other. Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions help find and choose a suitable mate.</li>
<li>A genetics system models inheritance of each wolf's genes, including eye color, physical and personality attributes, and genetic coat color.</li>
<li>Elk roam the lands in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, beavers and other prey.</li>
<li>Animals behave and change to the seasons. Herds migrate through the year. Bucks and bulls spar in the autumn rut and shed their antlers. Cows and does give birth and raise their own young.</li>
<li>Rival wolf packs maintain and protect their own territories from intruders - like you!</li>
<li>Bears, cougars and coyotes will challenge you for their kills and defend their own.  </li>
<li>Optional Ironwolf Mode: Live life on the edge, where each decision counts and your death can't be taken back.</li>
<li>Over 100 Achievements and a variety of collectible objects hidden across the map, from shed antlers, skulls, to lost human items.</li>
<li>And a lot more!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The only WolfQuestion I have is: why did I not play this back in 2008, when Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfquest-is-go">first wrote about it</a>? "RPS Wolfpack, anyone?" he queried at the time. "I got stuck in a Moose," objected Kieron Gillen (also RPS in peace) in the comments, declining to share vital context in a way that has just now come back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Alas and alack - as far as I can tell, Jim and Kieron did not subsequently have bizarro wolf/moose sex and start a distinct subspecies that survives and thrives on a long-forgotten server somewhere. Still, there's no reason we can't pick up where they left off. Perhaps I can persuade Graham to secure his legacy by participating in some wilderness doggo-bonking before he quits.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-dorks-it-is-not-too-late-to-be-a-janky-ass-wolf]]></content:encoded>
