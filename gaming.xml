            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and FuturLab have revealed the&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC release date, so get ready to hose down a bunch of&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>-related locations and objects. As the Steam page says, "playtime is ogre".</p>
<p>Landing on October 10th, the&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC is the latest in a long line of crossovers for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Other collaborations have included&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>.</p>
<p>In this particular DLC, you'll be able to take your powerwash tools to five different&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>-themed maps, each of which has a veritable kingdom's worth of dirt and grime for you to blast off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-swamp.jpg?itok=djRLIFbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-swamp.jpg?itok=lgpFHnS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>fan, the latest&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>DLC should have you ogre the moon.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the five maps you'll be able to explore and hose down as part of next month's&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC.</p>
<ul><li>Duloc</li>
<li>Hansel's Honeymoon Hideaway</li>
<li>Shrek's Swamp</li>
<li>Fairy Godmother's Potion Factory</li>
<li>Dragon's Lair</li>
</ul><p>As well as all of these maps, you'll also get access to a custom knight model for your character, and your power washer will take on the appearance of a sword, for what is knightly duty if not vanquishing filth from the kingdom?</p>
<p>If you want to see the&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC in action, then you can do so right here via the release date announcement trailer. Somebody once told me it's pretty good.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, it's a work sim game in which the aim is to visit a series of grimy locations and hose them down with your power washer.</p>
<p>Playing either solo or with your friends in online multiplayer, you'll build a business, switch up your tools for the job, and generally relax as you purge dirt and restore cleanliness to the land.</p>
<p>Although our own reviewer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review">wasn't particularly impressed</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-player-count">found a niche for itself</a>, garnering enough interest for Miniclip to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/miniclip-futurlab-acquisition">acquire developer FuturLab</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/powerwash-simulator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator/9NHDJC0NW20M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/powerwash-simulator-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap-promises-new-companions-and-more.985794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Spiders and publisher Nacon have revealed the&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap, showing off what's coming to the RPG in the months before it launches in full.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date">launches next week</a>, you'll have access to "the beginning of the story and its main quest", according to Spiders. This includes character creation and three zones, each of which has secrets to discover and allies to meet.</p>
<p>After that, in fall, you'll get access to a new companion and their associated quests, as well as an extension for the main story. You'll also be able to explore a new region and access&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2</em>'s main hub, as well as exploring two new skill trees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=_WCHjivD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=vt1JkaFq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots coming to&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>over the next few months.</figcaption></figure><p>Another new companion is on the way in the winter update for&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2</em>, and you'll get to experience their quests at that point too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The winter update will also bring the game's crafting system with it, as well as new local quests to take on in two of the main regions. A new skill tree and associated abilities will also be introduced at this point.</p>
<p>After that, you can look forward to lots more&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>content, including new companion and faction quests, a whole new region to explore, and more main story to experience. Suffice it to say that&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is just getting started.</p>
<p>Spiders also says that it plans to continuously update&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>with balance tweaks and content "depending on your feedback", so the above might not even be everything that's heading to the game in the coming months. Exciting!</p>

<p><em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably guessed, the followup to the original&nbsp;<em>GreedFall</em>. First <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-announced-2024">revealed in May 2022</a>, the game will serve as a prequel to the original&nbsp;<em>GreedFall&nbsp;</em>and will cast you as a Teer Fradee native thrust into a "treacherous" political climate.</p>
<p>The game's developer, Spiders, was recently embroiled in a dispute with its management regarding working conditions and employee pay, but that dispute was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-strike-policies-negotiations">resolved in the employees' favor earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches in Early Access for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_II_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on September 24th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/">has announced a special 30th anniversary collection</a> for the suite of PS5 consoles and accessories that is unfortunately sick as hell.</p><p>“To celebrate this 30th anniversary milestone, we had to create something that honored the history and joy that PlayStation has brought us all,” said PlayStation platform business CEO Hideaki Nishino. All the consoles and accessories are cast in classic PlayStation gray and feature the old-school multicolored PlayStation logo creating a look designed to target every gaming 30-something’s nostalgia organ with surgical precision.</p><p>The 30th anniversary collection features a PS5 Pro bundle that includes the console, two controllers, a controller charging station, a console stand, a sticker, and a matching cover if you purchase the Pro disc drive. You can find the details on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/">rest of the collection here</a>. Sony hasn’t included a price on any of this yet, and preorders begin on September 26th. If you want that PS5 Pro bundle, hop on preorders as soon as you can — Sony’s only making 12,300 of them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There will be 12,300 units of the PlayStation 5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle available for customers to purchase, with limited edition numbers etched onto the unit. The number represents the month and date of the first PlayStation console launch.</p><p>We’ve had five fantastic console generations since the launch of our very first PlayStation console. We’re proud of the innovations and experiences we’ve brought to the PlayStation community over the years as we kept up with the latest technology as it advanced. In the early days, the number of pixels was around 300-thousand, and now it is more than 8 million pixels for 4K on screen. Additionally, stereo sound evolved into surround sound – and now we are using 3D audio. The game controller has also evolved, starting with buttons, then came the analog stick and later vibration – and now we have haptics and even adaptive triggers. Everything we’ve done is to ensure PlayStation is the best place to play. We believe the beginning of our journey is an important part of our history at Sony Interactive Entertainment, which is why we are honoring this moment by bringing the original PlayStation design theme into the latest products for PlayStation 5 to commemorate the last 30 years. As we look ahead to the future, we will continue to innovate as technology evolves, so you can enjoy each memorable moment in your continued journey with PlayStation.</p><p>Please be sure to check in with us regularly on our 30th anniversary webpage as we’ll have more fun celebration activities as we head towards our 30th anniversary.</p><p>We’d like to give a heartfelt thanks to everyone for being a PlayStation fan over the last 30 years. There are plenty of great experiences to come and we look forward to the next 30 and beyond!</p><p><strong>PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection Purchase Information</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PlayStation-30th-Anniversary-Collection_2024_09-19-24_016.jpg"></a></figure><p>In regions where <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Direct</a> is available, players with a PlayStation Network account can pre-order the following PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection products exclusively from PlayStation starting September 26.

The short answer: It's utilizing cloud streaming. Microsoft notes the sequel will stream in higher details for your aerial adventures.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-and-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-consoles-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Sony has announced a limited edition classic-coloured console range for its 30th anniversary, with versions of both the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">newly-announced PlayStation 5 Pro</a> and the PS5 Digital Edition, both sporting a retro grey finish.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, there's a matching grey-coloured DualSense controller to go with the consoles. There's also a grey PlayStation Portal - remember that? - too.
</p>
<p>
Both the PS5 Pro and the PS5 Digital Edition also have classic-coloured PlayStation logos and textured plastic with the PlayStation symbols embossed in.

<p>
The entire range will only be available "while supplies last", though the PS5 Pro in particular will be in very short supply. Only 12,300 30th Anniversary PS5 Pro consoles will be sold (which Sony explained is  a reference to the brand's original 3rd December launch date). Each will be individually numbered.
</p>
<p>
Sony will open pre-orders on 26th September via direct.playstation.com ahead of the range's release on 21st November.</p>
<p>Crucially, there's no word yet on how much any of this will cost. (If a standard PS5 Pro costs £700, any guesses for what this might set you back?)
</p>
<p>
Both consoles will be packaged with a DualSense controller (the Pro gets a DualSense Edge as well) and also include a smattering of extra items. You get a retro PlayStation controller cable, four cable ties themed to the four PlayStation controller button shapes, a PlayStation sticker, a PlayStation poster, and a PlayStation paperclip.

The first PlayStation console launched in Japan on 3rd December 1994 - an anniversary that's now fast approaching. (Here in the UK, we had to wait until September 1995 for the PS1 to arrive on these shores.)

            <link>https://aftermath.site/big-love-sister-wives</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-love-sister-wives-and-feeling-religious-on-tv.985758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/big-love-sister-wives<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don’t think I’m alone in trying to fill the <em>Succession</em>-shaped hole in my life since the show ended last year. I worked my way through some of HBO’s other tentpoles, like <em>The Sopranos</em> (meh; please don’t yell at me), <em>Deadwood </em>(Luke was right that I shouldn’t have watched the movie), and yet another run through <em>The Leftovers</em>. Recently, I watched all five seasons of <em>Big Love</em>, a show about a polygamist family in Utah that ran from 2006 to 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>I was surprised that <em>Big Love</em> mostly predates <em>Sister Wives</em>, a polygamist reality show on HBO sister network TLC that started its 19th season last weekend, just as I finished my <em>Big Love</em> watch. <em>Big Love</em> stars the fictional Henrickson family: husband Bill; first and “public” wife Barb; second wife Nikki, a daughter of the head of the abusive polygamist compound Bill grew up on and was expelled from; and third and youngest wife Margene. <em>Sister Wives</em> husband Kody Brown has said he’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/sister-wives-kody-brown-said-could-relate-bill-hbos-big-love.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aware of and can relate to</a> <em>Big Love, </em>but that seems to be where the overlap ends. Both shows explore how people live their unusual faith together, but they do so in unexpectedly different ways.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Big Love</em> had five seasons. Here’s a video from HBO recapping seasons one through four; I’ll be honest I don’t know how to deal with spoiler warnings for a show that’s been off the air for 13 years, but proceed at your own risk.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Big Love: Catch Up on Seasons 1 thru 4 (HBO)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C7Y0KfL5zzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The major tension for much of <em>Big Love</em> is that the Henricksons will be found out for being polygamist and incur the wrath of their community and the mainstream LDS (Latter Day Saints, or, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/17/us/mormon-church-name-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contentiously</a>, Mormon) church, which decries polygamy in its history and the satellite faiths that exist today. Alongside that, the Henricksons have familial tensions: Nikki’s continued relationship to the compound, Margene’s efforts to make friends and find herself, Barb coming to chafe against the demands and constraints of their way of life. You’d think all that would be more than enough fodder for a show, but <em>Big Love</em> isn’t content to stay in the family lane, sprawling out into plotlines that sometimes stretch the bounds of believability. There’s drama at Bill’s home goods stores. The family tries to open a Mormon-friendly casino. People poison and bludgeon and shoot each other. There’s a big trial and a federal investigation and interference in the investigation. There’s a kidnapping and rescue mission. There’s medical experimentation. There’s underage marriage. (It’s worth noting that the show ran at the height of attention paid to FLDS, or Fundamentalist LDS,&nbsp; leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warren Jeffs</a>, whom the compound plotlines feel clearly inspired by.) It’s hard to tell if the show wants to be a domestic drama or some kind of thriller, and it careens wildly in ways that are exciting, but also make it hard to know what kind of show it is.&nbsp;</p><p>A friend of mine<a href="https://x.com/dialmformichele/status/1803646714819105180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suggested</a> seeing <em>Big Love</em> as a sitcom rather than a prestige show. Kody Brown called it “a soap opera.” I think both these definitions are pretty accurate: It has great fundamentals in terms of a cast of characters with strong identities and goals, but at the end of every episode and every season, they basically stay the same. The later seasons attempt to create some movement, and do to an extent, but the characters felt like they always fell back into their roles, rather than growing in the way you’d expect in a prestige drama.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most intriguing thing I found about the show was how sympathetic it is to polygamy while also making it seem so utterly unappealing. Despite how often the family insists they love each other, and how much Bill bangs on about his commitment to his family and the principle of plural marriage, the family is mostly a site for narrative conflict rather than genuine love. The cast is full of children who basically exist to be sent out of the room. The wives clash over and grapple with the logistics of their lives–the finances, the scheduling–but the show doesn’t dwell too much on how it would actually <em>feel</em> to be in a marriage that requires weekly meetings. I frequently wondered why the family didn’t just break up.&nbsp;(I should point out that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/12/11210932/big-love-hbo-religion-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other viewers</a> don't share my view of this.)</p><p>But at the same time, <em>Big Love</em> casts the Henricksons as bold, faithful outsiders. They’re fighting the good fight to protect their family and their version of polygamy against the secular world’s misconceptions and the compound’s abuses, down to stirring speeches to the government and the public. The show seems to want you to root for them and, by extension, polygamy, but it’s also careful not to express any positive feelings about polygamy or show it in a positive light. In one way this gives you space to draw your own conclusions, but in another it feels like it just keeps everything at a remove.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Big Love: Season 5 Extended Trailer (HBO)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QgVT4CYsMRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I can’t figure out if I actually <em>liked</em> the show, even though I watched it all. You might know I have an interest in religion and especially <a href="https://www.conspirituality.net/episodes/brief-cult-of-the-lamb-riley-macleod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cults</a> or smaller faiths, and how they’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-cults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portrayed in media</a>. As such, <em>Big Love</em>’s exploration of tensions between the LDS church and the Henricksons, and the Henricksons and the compound, were fascinating to me, being so specific to a certain corner of religion that often gets painted with an <a href="https://religionandpolitics.org/2022/05/10/violence-in-mormon-ways-a-review-of-under-the-banner-of-heaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overly-broad or slanted</a> brush. I was watching it alongside the height of attention to trad wife influencer <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/nara-smith-lucky-blue-smith-tiktok-mormon-tradwife-1234979241/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nara Smith</a>, and every time I saw someone on social media “uncover” that she’s Mormon, I had to resist the urge to tweet <em>Yeah, sometimes people are just </em><a href="https://www.allure.com/story/why-so-many-beauty-bloggers-are-mormon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mormons</em></a><em>, it’s not a gotcha</em>.</p><p><em>Big Love</em> takes my unsent tweets a step further by saying yeah, sometimes those people are even just polygamists, and in doing so, it does something really interesting with how religion gets talked about on TV. By taking the Henricksons’ family and faith as givens more than subjects in themselves, it can go to these weird and dramatic and sometimes unbelievable places instead of spending time defending its core premise. It doesn’t have to have plots about being a sister wife; it can have plots about sister wives smuggling exotic birds. In some ways, I’m kind of excited about how disappointed I felt in the show’s emotional distance–in wishing it had more feeling, in wishing it delved more deeply into the felt experience of its characters’ faith, that meant it wasn’t holding religion up as an oddity to be gawked at.&nbsp;</p><p>This is very different from <em>Sister Wives, </em>which at its start at least clearly wanted you to watch the oddballs. Starting in 2010, <em>Sister Wives</em> follows a real polygamist family, the Browns, with husband Kody already in a relationship with wives Meri, Janelle, and Christine. When it began, they were just considering adding fourth wife Robin; in the latest season, Robin is the only wife left, with all the others having left Kody or, in Meri’s case, a decision somewhere between mutual and Kody dumping her. The entire premise has changed so much that, while watching the opening credits, I wondered if the show should still even be called <em>Sister Wives</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="New Season | Sister Wives | TLC" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpYxY3XfRS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Everyone on the show has different explanations for why the family broke down. I don’t think I’m the only viewer who would chalk it up to Kody: while it was easy to look askance at his ego and generally conservative worldview and the whole structure of the family with the man at the head, in the show’s earliest days he seemed to truly love his family and respect his wives. But covid, Trumpian politics, and most likely the effects of being on TV for so long clearly took their toll on him. He was never a “great” guy by my standards, but the way he’s become demanding and cruel and subsequently driven so much of his family away can be genuinely hard to watch.</p><p>When <em>Sister Wives</em> started, it felt kind of revelatory to me as a portrayal of an unusual religion. Since their unique family and how it differs from the viewers’ was the whole reason the Browns were on TV, the show focused at length on the logistics of that family, how everyone feels and how their needs get met. As such, it didn’t steer clear of showing people really <em>wrangling</em> with living their faith. I was impressed by how this showed the family as intentional and thoughtful about their relationships and their connection to their religious beliefs. Even when I wanted to yell “Queer people have already thought of this; read a book!” at my TV when the Browns faced domestic struggles, I thought there was a lot of value in showing the messy but loving reality (or “<a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reality</a>”) of their religious family at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sister Wives: Meet Kody and the Wives (S1, E1) | Full Episode" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LJWi5z1SCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And though it feels voyeuristic, it’s even fascinating to watch their family breaking apart. What does it mean to get divorced within a cosmology that holds <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2023/01/10-families-are-eternal?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family as eternal</a>; what does it mean to get divorced when you aren’t legally married, or when you’re married in a spiritual sense? It’s been interesting to watch the sister wives try to figure out if they’re still family without their relationship to Kody binding them; in the latest episode, Christine says that she and Janelle have a “sister wife family,” while other wives have less close relationships. It’s tough to watch Robin support Kody through multiple simultaneous divorces while she’s still married to him, and tragic to watch her grieve losing the family full of other wives that she joined the Browns for, a struggle so unique to their faith.</p><p>Lest this sound like <em>Sister Wives</em> is some masterpiece of television, it’s still an essentially trashy reality TV show. I fell off it for a long time when I didn’t have access to TV; when I came back recently, I was frustrated with how it’s grown slow-moving and repetitively structured and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TLCsisterwives/comments/15cd5ty/has_production_ever_explained_why_the_show_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years behind</a>. I sort of hope for everyone’s sake that the show ends soon, though I’m sure there are contracts and the cast’s financial situations to think of. After so long and <a href="https://people.com/sister-wives-janelle-brown-no-idea-garrison-brown-struggling-before-death-exclusive-8710021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so much</a>, it’s probably time for the Browns to live their lives offscreen.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Sister Wives</em> does the opposite thing as <em>Big Love, </em>which, by not focusing too hard on the family, doesn’t take a stance on polygamy. By showing polygamy as abnormal and focusing all its attention on why and how, <em>Sister Wives</em>, or at least its earlier seasons, ran the risk of making the Browns’ faith and way of life seem <em>too </em>appealing. But this is also, strangely, TLC’s MO, given the network’s weird obsession with fundamentalist and conservative religions; this is the network that laundered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw1rAMzPf70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duggars</a>’ abuses and papered over the harms of the <a href="https://economichardship.org/2019/03/tlc-show-cynthia-jeub-kids-by-the-dozen-quiverfull-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quiverfull </a>movement, performing what a 2015 Buzzfeed article calls “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahjones/how-tlcs-fundamentalism-as-kitsch-hurts-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fundamentalism as kitsch</a>.” Like the Henricksons, in early <em>Sister Wives </em>episodes the Browns make it clear they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/sister-wives-kody-brown-flds-warren-jeffs-becoming-sister-wives-memoir-not-my-world.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aren’t FLDS</a>, but the show is still ultimately glossing over the more <a href="https://people.com/tv/gwendlyn-brown-says-trans-sibling-leon-has-been-separating-from-sister-wives-family-to-feel-safer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenging</a> parts of the Browns’ faith. And all <em>this</em> is to say nothing of the idea of kids growing up on reality TV at all, and the harms that surely causes.</p><p>(If you’re interested in fundamentalism and reality TV, allow me to recommend the excellent YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FundieFridays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fundie Fridays</a>. Also, if you know anything but why the hell TLC is like this, please <a href="https://aftermath.site/tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let me know</a>.)</p><p>I would have expected the shows to do the opposite of what they do with where they place their specific faiths in relation to the viewer. I’d think <em>Big Love</em>, with a room full of fiction writers unbound by reality, would have more space to explore the emotional landscape of polygamy. And I’d have thought that <em>Sister Wives</em>, with its interest in what makes the Browns unusual, would spend more time highlighting the ways they clash with the outside world. But the shows instead trade places.</p><p>I’m obviously torn on whether either show is “good” or if I’d recommend them. And I’m not an expert in Mormonism or its offshoots, though I know some <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469682709/queering-kinship-in-the-mormon-cosmos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart folks</a> who are. But the timing that led me to watch the two shows so close together let me see them as on something of the same project, doing different things with how media can feel religious.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During Kai's trip to San Francisco to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, he was able to secure <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-qa-no-side-quest-exists-without-contributing-to-the-narrative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive interview</a> with BioWare's Francois Chaput (Missions and Level Design Director) and Matt Rhodes (Art Director). Later, though, he also participated in a roundtable Q&amp;A with Game Directors Corinne Busche and John Epler where various colleagues from the press were able to ask their questions.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting answers came on the topic of companions, which are the very focus of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and even prompted <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the title change from Dreadwolf</a>. When asked when they decided companions wouldn't be directly controllable (unlike previous installments), they said:</p>
<p><em><strong>Corinne Busche:</strong> I think I can start this one and then maybe John if you want to jump in. Dragon Age has such an amazing, rich lore and history behind it. The worldbuilding, I really think it's what's kept this franchise alive and people discussing it 10 years after Inquisition. So our North Star was that we wanted you to embody Rook, to step into Rook's shoes, to experience this world on the ground as this character. And what that meant is giving you more autonomy, more control of the character, putting you in control of every single swing, and really making it feel like you're a part of this world.</em></p>
<p><em>What's more, we've talked a lot about the companions. I know a lot of the questions that came up today about Dragon Age: The Veilguard were about the depth and authenticity of the companions. We really felt like there was a big opportunity here to make the companions feel more realized, more like their characters who fight alongside you and have their own styles, motivations, and interactions if you're not actually embodying them.</em></p>
<p><em>But of course, throughout all of that, we do know in the combat system, that sense of teamwork, of pause and play, tactical depth. That has been the throughline through every single edition of Dragon Age. So we wanted to walk the fine line of making that teamwork and that sense of strategy show up but also make you feel like you're in this world.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>John Epler:</strong> Yeah, and Corinne touched on autonomy as far as Rook goes, but also part of making the companions feel like their own people, like their own characters, is giving them that autonomy as well on the battlefield. Again, you are the leader of this group. They have their own personalities and their own stories, and we wanted to make sure that you felt that through the gameplay as well.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time BioWare has talked about companions being '<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-the-most-complex-fully-realized-companions-weve-ever-crafted-says-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully realized</a>', though it is the first time they've linked that to the decision to remove direct player control of the party, which remains controversial for some fans.</p>
<p>We won't have too much to wait until we can play Dragon Age: The Veilguard for ourselves and decide whether it was the right choice. In the meantime, stay tuned for the full transcript of the roundtable Q&amp;A.</p>

			<p><span>BioWare and Electronic Arts recently invited a select number of media and influencers, Wccftech included, to their western California campus to get some of the first hands-on with their long-awaited sequel to the Dragon Age franchise. It’s been a long time coming and a series of iterations to get to where we are now and with the release only a handful of weeks away, gamers will finally have the opportunity to take up the mantle of The Veilguard.</span></p>
<p><span>Built upon the narrative started nearly two decades ago and touched on as recently as Dragon Age: Inquisition’s DLC, Dragon Age: The Veilguard starts with a daemon attack upon Tevinter and the swift introduction to the player’s chosen Rook and only a small selection of the Veil jumpers that will form the basis for the player’s faction of interlopers this time around: the Veil Jumpers. Varric and Bianca also make their presence known early on, but this time around, the plucky thief is more content with taking a more passive role along this adventure.</span></p>
<p><span>This opening act was the very same that’s been present from the very <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a> gameplay footage shown to the world of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. From character creation up through that fateful encounter with Solas (which for many players may indeed be the first time that they’ve met face to face if coming in having skipped Dragon Age: Inquisition), I got to see firsthand the carnage that attempting to tear open the Veil might cause despite some good intentions behind the act.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dragon-Age-Dreadwolf-Screenshot-Bellara.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Bioware has invested a great amount of time into the character creation suite of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Keep has sadly been left behind in an earlier console generation and, with it, a way to carry forward the status of Thedas and choices made prior. BioWare remedied this to a lesser extent by permitting the player to make a few key observations about the state of the world but this is a feature that they intend to keep under wraps until much closer to release. For the player's own iteration of the Rook, players can change everything from the body type and pronouns down to freckles and hair growth. A player could easily spend a solid hour trying to come up with the perfect character, only to change their minds midway through the adventure. To remedy this, there is a magic mirror inside the main base of operations that serves as aesthetician and barber all in one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the roughly six hours of playable gameplay to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, we had to jump about within the narrative to experience a variety of the story without taking part in one solid block of time. Following the initial reveal of Solas and his end goals, the story then jumps forward to a bit of time later on in the first act as players have already formed up a minor resistance band known as the Veil Jumpers. This dysfunctional troupe of heroes and anti-heroes are united together to follow a path first laid out by the Dreadwolf and Elven god himself.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dragon-Age-The-Veilguard-Champion-Skill-Tree.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>In these early formative quests of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, a majority of the cast has already been assembled for those common goals. Progressing the narrative will not always be a straight line. Side quests routinely break up the pacing of the story without feeling rushed to save the world, even if there should be a proper sense of urgency in the battle of gods. Many of these sidequests were locked out from accessing during the preview as EA instead wished for players to continue on a familiar path across all early players. There is a fair bit of exploration available to the player in The Crossroads, another familiar locale for Dragon Age veterans, but the kiddie rails were left on to prevent any one of us from delving into uncharted spoiler territory.</span></p>
<p><span>The primary choice offered to me was in regards to bringing the Veil Jumpers to one of two catastrophic events to protect and resolve. For me, the obvious choice was to track down a blood mage and put them down; from taking a moment to peek at the neighbors around me during the preview session, this appeared to be the less popular option. While I was a veritable powerhouse with a two-handed hammer for much of the quest, facing the mage while she was bathing in an infinite pool of blood slowed down to a halt. No longer was I cracking kneecaps and hurling shields for kills in one or two hits. </span></p>
<p><span>Instead, this boss fight was an exercise in tedium as the fight itself lasted close to ten minutes of constant attacks, darting behind pillars to avoid bloodborne missiles and smacking the occasional zombie minion to recharge my champion’s ultimate ability only to repeat over and over. Presumably, there was some key conversation or dropped lore entry that might have yielded a weakness I could have exploited early on in the fight, but I was unsuccessful in locating it during my demo session.</span></p>

<p>Any fears that Dragon Age: The Veilguard may be watered down in its combat were quickly washed away as I settled into the roles of Mage and later Warrior. Each class offered at least two different distinct playstyles depending on the primary and secondary weapons along with a relatively small list of equipable actions that almost all ran either on some sort of timer or required some energy to charge up in the case of Rook's ultimate attacks. The combat itself sits somewhere between Dragon Age II's action combat and a character action game. Dodges and evasive maneuvers are critical in combat with only a few healing options available to the character (players can bring three health potions at a time into battle, although I did find a piece of gear later on that would expand that with an additional potion slot) and only a very few actual healing spells across all of the various classes and specializations.</p>
<p>Assuming direct control of the Rook's party members is a thing of the past in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with the crew actually playing relatively smart and synergizing automatically with the player's given playstyle with their own abilities. There is still a pause menu where players can issue specific commands and utilize combo attacks under the right conditions, but players will spend most of the time in combat assuming control of Rook to slash, cast, and roll their way through hordes of enemies. It's a change that will take some getting used to but I've rather enjoyed the evolution to role-playing combat that BioWare has devised in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><span>In the years since Dragon Age: Inquisition graced our Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s, BioWare has become master craftspeople with their facial capture technology. Far more impressive than the exotic landscapes and gruesome evil monsters are the fine touches they’ve put into every little thing for the Rook and their various party members, from gentle smirks to glorious shouts. This is one title I’ll have to look forward to playing on PC or the newly announced PlayStation 5 Pro at the very least.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s rather fitting that players will have had to wait roughly the same amount of time since Dragon Age 4’s initial reveal between the canon events of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Trespasser leading Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but that wait will be over soon. Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be available across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC on October 31st, 2024. PC players with an active EA Play Pro subscription will also be able to journey through Thedas the very same day.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard Hands-On - A Cure for Tiresome Open Worlds]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-a-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds.985734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is a massive game and step forward for the series. Its design is thoughtful, the moment to moment gameplay exhilarating, and full of spectacle around every corner. For many, this will not only be a return to form for BioWare but a level up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before going further, check out the above video to see much of what I’m discussing here in-motion and a bunch of other features like the character creator, views of the class skill trees, the companion skill trees, and a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of describing combat to you, we have a few videos showing off different levels of <em>Veilguard</em>’s gameplay. We have one focused on the <a href="https://youtu.be/NwxJf2_uVu0">Warrior class showing early combat</a>, one on the <a href="https://youtu.be/oqorhe8uT-M">Mage class showing a more intermediate look at combat</a>, and then we have <a href="https://youtu.be/Flt6JRXJBcY">a video on Rogue combat</a> that shows what a well-crafted higher character can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all, there’s about an hour’s worth of footage to take in if you want to see what <em>Veilguard </em>is all about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I write this, I am keeping in mind my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion">interview with Game Director Corinne Busche</a>. In that interview, we discuss the design philosophy behind how they handle player choice and just how much it permeates the entire game. BioWare’s approach really shows up in every aspect of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to read that interview as a companion piece to this, as it talks a lot more about important player choices, dialogue choices, and relationships with companions. The amount of effectual choices you can make is truly impressive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as the choices you make in the story and the relationships you’ll make in the game are vast and varied, so too are the options for you to play the game just as you want. Your toolbox when it comes to combat is humongous.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard’s Skill Trees Encourage Experimentation&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The skill trees for the various classes have a staggering amount of variety and nuance to them. &nbsp;Each tree has a few defined paths to specializations, which in themselves are great, but there’s a lot of things on the margins for you to take in as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to note is that <em>Veilguard </em>has a level cap of 50, and while I haven’t counted them, there’s definitely well over 100 nodes in the skill tree to make your build. So, there’s a lot of freedom to do what you want with a build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it also means is that the trees were designed with the knowledge that you won’t be able to fill out even most of it, so they are filled with a bunch of strategic decisions to build something unique to your playstyle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In just the Warrior alone, you can build something around parrying, around shield throwing, around two handed weapons, a lifestealing build, and man so much more. I wish I had studied the trees a little closer as there’s so much there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the developers said at the preview event I attended that the finetuning of the trees has been a big focus of <em>Veilguard</em>’s development with the hope that people can outsmart the developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, they mentioned that someone playtesting the game was able to make a shield-throwing Warrior build that could more or less one shot bosses. That of course needed to be tuned down some, but they’re excited at the prospect of what people will be able to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with my limited time messing with it, I can already see that a popular post in Dragon Age communities and social media &nbsp;will be showing off crazy builds and the combos you can pull off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part of the skill tree is the fact you can redo it whenever you want. There is no limit on respeccing what you want, so you can fine tune between encounters if you want or just change something completely.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gear is More than Just Numbers&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Adding a layer on top of that is the gear you’ll equip. There are a lot of different status effects and attributes that can affect the damage you do. Focus on breaking down shields, barriers, holding people in place, staggering – there are stats for all of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gear isn’t simply just a “bigger number is better” approach, either. Pieces of armor or a weapon can be dramatically different from one another, and I can foresee a possibility where you find something so sick you change your build to make use of its stats and abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Runes are another piece of gear you get access to that add a lot of versatility. You can equip up to three and each come with some sort of active ability and stat boost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, one might just give you a straight 10% bonus to cold damage and then have an active ability that increases your ability damage by 20% for a certain time period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the three runic abilities will be available to you in combat, too. You can cycle through their use as another active ability to use.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Companions are Key to an Optimum Build, Too&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One final wrinkle to consider when trying to make the most optimum build you can are your companions. Like your player character, companions have fairly expansive skill trees and even gear to equip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you venture out with your two companions, you can equip them with three abilities each. Each companion has five different abilities to choose from, each of which have their own upgrade path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, the skill trees are no where as huge as the player character’s, but you can change up what sort of effectiveness an ability has pretty significantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, in that screenshot above Davrin has the ability Death From Above. That’s something he can call down from the sky to cause a small explosion, damage, and stagger some enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one upgrade path, you can go full bore and try to make Death from Above the most devastating AoE attack you can. In the other, it will buff your companions and yourself in various ways at the same time becoming a pseudo-support ability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some abilities go from causing huge types of certain kinds of damage to trying to control the field more, like slowing or freezing enemies in place. Or maybe you’re wanting someone to heal, to keep enemies at a distance, or just try to blow up as much as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are all viable options that you can use to complement your playstyle. With a Mage or even a Rogue focusing on the bow, some companions may be more helpful in controlling the field by allowing you to keep your distance and stay in range. Or maybe they can group enemies up while another companion sticks them in place for you to deliver some powerful blow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a lot of choices you can make in not only the party make up but the individual choices for your companions, which can empower you’re preferred playstyle a great amount.</p>

<p>Synergy is the word the developers use with your companions, and there is certainly a lot to be found. Not only in just the straight utility of the abilities, but there are some abilities companions or player characters can use simultaneously for a big bonus in damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amount of player choice you have in how you want to play is truly astonishing and like nothing I’ve seen in an action RPG of this type before. It’s not only the choices you can make but just how obviously effective they are. It’s not simple stat increases here and there but huge shake ups that dramatically effect how you can play the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said before, BioWare told us at the preview event that they can’t wait to see how players outsmart the development team with the incredible tools they’re putting in our hands.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard Isn’t Open World But Still Feels Huge&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I don’t know about you, but the open world formula has been pretty tiresome in so many games for so long. Too often great ideas and great games are bogged down by open world bloat and “activities” littered on a map just for something to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> gives you the best of both worlds in terms of having plenty of exploration with hand-crafted gameplay experiences. At no time in my near 7 hours of playing the game did it feel claustrophobic or that I wasn’t immersed in some massive well-realized world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Veilguard </em>is mission-based, so you’ll gather up some companions and venture out to complete some quest, or more than one, in a specific area of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shedding the weight of designing an effective open world lets <em>Veilguard</em> really shine. Each of the missions I completed were full of awesome spectacle, a cool set piece, or some exquisite arena in which to fight a boss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those epic crescendo moments saved for big climaxes in games feel like they’re around every corner in <em>Veilguard</em>. I was constantly delighted and taken aback by the amazing imagery and emotion these hugely dramatic moments constantly portrayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best moments of so many games are not remembered from how you got from point a to point b but what you actually did when you got there. Those fine-tuned gameplay sequences that really show a game at its best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More or less, that’s basically what <em>Veilguard </em>is. The prologue kicks you off in what the developers wanted to feel like was the final mission of a game, a big story concluding moment to set the stage. From that point on, Veilguard never really lets go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, I can’t imagine the whole game is as crazy cool at that rate it was in my preview. The snippets of gameplay the chose to show were put there for a reason, after all. Regardless, I think there’s a lot to look forward to.</p>

<p>I don’t want you to think that <em>Veilguard </em>is just high-octane action all the time, as BioWare has a reputation for crafting some good stories – particularly in telling stories about the companions you gather along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those intimate character moments are still there. Between missions you’ll be at your base of operations, The Lighthouse, where everyone can kind of chill and collect their thoughts. You’ll have the opportunity to talk with and learn a ton more about the companions and the world at large there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them are well-realized with well-defined personalities, beliefs, desires, goals, and everything else that goes into a great character. It is learning who these folks are that we really get to start putting the rest of the world-threatening plot into perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Crossroads Will Satisfy Your Exploration Urges&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Lighthouse is a sanctuary within the Veil for your party to hangout, but you’ll quickly get access to another part of the Veil for travel: The Crossroads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crossroads is a place in-between in the Veil that allows for quick travel all around the world. It is an expansive set of ruins, structures, dungeons, and more just waiting to be discovered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can engage with The Crossroads as much or as little as you want. Once you’ve made y our way to the major fast travel point to get you to somewhere in the world, you don’t have to do much in The Crossroads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is a lot of story and sidequesting to be done there. It’s full of open world puzzling, random events, and quests to stumble upon. For example, in one I stumbled into an old memory of Solas’ past, getting to experience it firsthand while delving a dungeon.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> feels like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s cousin. I know how insane that sentence sounds, particularly with BioWare’s history in the <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both are RPGs with incredible tools for player agency with actual game changing consequences. Both focus heavily on deep connective stories with companions and party members. Both let you get as crazy as you want with their respective combat systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, both in terms of design philosophy and quality, I think <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is to action RPGs what <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is to CRPGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might be a little early to say that, as there’s a whole lot of the game I didn’t see, but I don’t think I’ve walked away feeling better about the quality of a game than with <em>Veilguard</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was previewed at an event with close to 7 hours of hands-on gameplay.</p>

<p>Of course, all of these items are in-game cosmetics as opposed to game-boosting extras. If you want those, then you'll have to shell out for the Explorer Edition, which includes goodies like an exclusive map location, a prestige package to help you get started, and more.</p>

You've managed a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/two-point-hospital">hospital</a> and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/two-point-campus">university campus</a>, and now, it's time to manage your very own museum.</p>
<p>You'll be looking after the museum, deciding where to place exhibits, and ensuring that the welfare of your guests is at the top of your priority list, but your responsibilities don't stop there.</p>

<p>As well as running the museum, you'll also be sourcing your own exhibits, and you'll have to contend with thieves trying to make off with your museum's contents as well, so make sure you're vigilant!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion-relationships.985728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has a rich history of innovation when it comes to player choice and agency, from the dialogue wheel to the relationships you build with companions. With that in mind, I had a chance to talk with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> Game Director Corinne Busche about player choice and what it means for your character and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/4Ejlg-sn-AU">overview video of everything we learned about </a></em><a href="https://youtu.be/4Ejlg-sn-AU">Dragon Age: The Veilguard </a><em>in our seven hour preview here.</em></p>
<h2>Player Choice in Veilguard Is Intimate&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are near endless ways to handle player choice, and I wanted to know what their guiding principles were in <em>Veilguard</em>’s design. Busche had an interesting answer as to their approach: intimacy.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted you to feel like you're in this world, that you're more attached and on the ground than perhaps even other entries in the game or in the IP’s history. So with that comes a level of intimacy. So choice and consequence, particularly as it relates to narrative beats, we really lean into what are those things that are going to affect people's lives? &nbsp;... What are those really personal moments where you feel like, if you really care about this character, that you can help them make some of the most important decisions of their lives? ... Our choices, that intimacy and connection, that sense of immersion, is really our North Star.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, and Busche wanted to stress this as well, intimacy doesn’t necessarily mean romantic (don’t worry, it’s BioWare so you’ll have plenty of romance options).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intimacy just means being close, having an understanding. Getting into the nitty gritty of details and information of your own character and those they interact with.</p>

<p>Based on my time with the game and further conversation with Busche, I think that is a great word that shows its influence throughout <em>Veilguard</em>’s design. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard Companion Relationships Are Impactful and Complex&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Obviously, the relationships you have with characters will be intimate. There is a closeness that will develop from their shared cause of the game, of course, and you have an opportunity to make them more personal if you wish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companions in <em>Veilguard </em>cast a huge shadow of course, both in how integral they are to the plot and in how they ground the game. They have unique personalities, motivations, and past histories. Naturally, that means you’ll get a wide variety of reactions to the choices you make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to decisions affecting companions:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be times where it changes the nature of the dynamic you have with them. There will be times when people need to step away. Another factor is, do you actually help them out with their own personal motivations, and how does that affect how they show up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on where you or your companions are in the story, they may be off doing their own thing. They have goals, desires, and a whole life outside the main plot of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, maybe you made one angry with a decision but maybe they just have something they needed to do, so off they go. You’ll even have a chance to run into companions going about their business when you’re out exploring as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not all choices are so obviously huge they may send a companion off to take a break or what have you either, as the small choices through dialogue or elsewhere build up to big effects, too.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Companion Progression in Veilguard&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Building relationships with companions is exactly how you’ll see them progress, with Busche noting that they’ve taken a new approach to companion progression in <em>Veilguard</em>:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So their progression is based on how well you know and understand one another. It's directly tied to your relationship with them. And it's not necessarily how friendly you are with them, it's how well you know each other, how well you know how to work together. So as I bring companions with me on missions, I help solve their problems, that's going to improve that sense of connection, and that's going to make us work better as a team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as gaining XP is fun and all, your companions won’t just level up with the player character at the same rate. Instead, the level of your relationship grows the closer you get to them. That grows through conversation, bringing them on missions, choices, and quests specific to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each companion has a fairly expansive skill tree that you can customize as you wish. Obviously, the lower your relationship with them, the fewer points you’re able to put in their skill tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skill trees aren’t just simple upgrades to stats, like more strength or what have you. Each node on the tree directly affects one ability or another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did ask if there could be situation where a companion would be underpowered if I never used them in <em>Veilguard</em>, but Busche said that while they won’t have quite as much at their disposal, companions will always have an effect. They’ll never be useless.</p>
<p>Growing that relationship level isn't just as simple as spending time with them, either.&nbsp;Each have their own complex histories, preferences, and desires that will inform the way they act and react.</p>
<h2>Companion and Character Histories Matter a Lot&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This philosophy is applied to all your interactions and the reactions you’ll receive from companions and characters along the way. Romance, however, is probably the easiest to see how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you can certainly pursue all of your companions, that doesn’t mean that <em>Veilguard </em>will just let you romance them just for the sake of it. If you do certain things or make certain choices, they just won’t be that interested in you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, as Busche described, companions won’t conform to the player. They won’t just crumple their beliefs and preferences for the sake of letting you romance someone. In other words, it has to make sense.</p>
<p>Outside of even romance, Busche made sure to note that growing these relationships doesn't necessarily mean you'll be friends with all the companions. The shared experience and common cause create an intimacy, but there's a chance your personalities just won't gel. A working relationship you could say.</p>

<p>In the mix of all of this are the choices you made when creating a character and those you continue to make when further defining who your Rook will be in the game. Character creation choices from the race you are to your background, class, and those choices beyond the character creator are just as impactful and intimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Busche gave two examples of these intimate choices. In one, if you’re playing a dwarf, you can have an interesting conversation with Harding early in the game as both your character and her have a dream. Dwarves don’t dream and they’re wondering what the hell is going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another, Busche described a smaller decision with a less important character having a big impact:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the smaller choices, but one that hit me quite hard, it sits with me, is when you have choices of maybe somebody living or dying, but if I'm a Grey Warden, well I can send them to the order as well and they show up later in the game. And while that might not be a world shaking decision, you really get the sense that, like you're affording a second chance to these characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a ton of opportunities to make <em>Veilguard </em>your own that extend far beyond the choices you make in dialogue, about certain characters, or about deviances in the plot, too.</p>
<h2>Be Who You Want To Be&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Busche said that one of their pillars of design was “Be who you want to be.” That is precisely the experience they want players to have, so you can customize your character in so many ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We break down the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds">various systems of<em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> here</a>, but you’ll have the chance to customize your character’s class, skill tree, armor, companion skill trees, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is even an option to customize pretty much every UI element of the game, removing or adding whatever you want. That means that, yes, you could have absolutely nothing on screen if you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To boil it all down, that “be who you want to be” pillar is the goal Busche is trying to achieve in <em>Veilguard</em>. From important companion relationships, to the plot, to character customization, to skills, to gear, and everything in-between, <em>Veilguard </em>is striving to let you play any way you want.&nbsp;</p>

The studio that developed&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">the game at the heart of the suit</a>, issued a statement early this morning saying it doesn’t know what patents it violated. “At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details,” the statement read. </p><p>According to Nintendo’s press release, the reason for the lawsuit has to do with Pocketpair allegedly infringing on multiple as yet undisclosed patents. The details of the lawsuit have not yet been made public, so we do not yet know which patents, and according to Pocketpair’s statement, it doesn’t know, either.</p><p>The news broke last night that Nintendo and TPC were suing the makers of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24048972/palworld-news-trailers"><em>Palworld</em></a><em> </em>— an open-world survival crafting game that features a collection of companion monsters players can catch and battle. Since its release in January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">the game became an instant hit</a>, racking up over 10 million in copies sold and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048343/but-for-palworld-it-was-tuesday">breaking Steam concurrent player records</a> within its first few weeks. Almost immediately, people noticed striking similarities between<em> Palworld</em>’s “pals” and pokémon from their looks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">down to their extraordinarily similar character models</a>.</p><p>Though Nintendo’s not going after Pocketpair because <a href="https://palworld.fandom.com/wiki/Lamball">lamballs</a> look uncomfortably similar to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/wooloo">wooloos</a>, we do know the company is famously litigious in protecting its brand. Shortly after <em>Palworld</em>’s release, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24047854/nintendo-palworld-pokemon-mod-youtube-dmca">TPC ordered a programmer to take down a video</a> that featured a mod of <em>Palworld</em> that replaced all the pals with pokémon. It also issued a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050320/pokemon-palworld-investigation-copyright-plagiarism">saying it was aware of <em>Palworld</em></a> — although the statement did not refer to the game by name — and would be investigating the game to “take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.” Looks like the company found something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After playing seven hours of <em>The Veilguard</em>, I’m feeling more confident than ever that it has.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c6257fe1e703fa6b1b830ed78169d62" data-recommend-id="image://9c6257fe1e703fa6b1b830ed78169d62" data-format="gif" data-width="626" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Solas confronts Rook in the Fade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solas confronts Rook in the Fade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c6257fe1e703fa6b1b830ed78169d62" data-recommend-id="image://9c6257fe1e703fa6b1b830ed78169d62" data-format="gif" data-width="626" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Solas confronts Rook in the Fade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a long-time fan of the series, what struck me most about <em>The Veilguard </em>was how, despite its fast-paced action combat bearing little or no resemblance to the battles from previous games, much of the connective tissue between this story and past worldbuilding feels intact. The game stars Rook, a new hero of your own creation, working with beloved characters Varric Tethras and Scout Harding to take down Solas, the elven mage from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> who, it’s revealed in a post-credits scene, is actually an elven god called the Dread Wolf. <em>The Veilguard</em> has its own twists and turns that make even that synopsis merely the tip of the iceberg, but as a starting point, it’s comforting to know we’re heading into the conflict fans have been waiting for.</p><p>But it’s not just the main plot that draws heavily from previous threads. Much of the game takes place in Minrathous, the magical capital city of the Tevinter Imperium where magic reigns over the common man. We’ve heard conflicting accounts about the city, from characters like <em>Inquisition’s</em> mage pariah Dorian Pavus and <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s elven slave Fenris. Now, we’re finally going to what feels like BioWare’s magical take on an oppressive cyberpunk city, where we’ll get to form our own impressions of it and—in classic BioWare fashion—make a difference. I’ve been a mage in all three previous games. I loved a Tevinter slave in <em>DA2 </em>and a man who hoped to change the country in <em>Inquisition</em>. In playing the early hours as my radical mage Rook, it felt like all of my time in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe had been leading to this moment.</p><h2 id="h107"><a id=""></a><strong><em>The Veilguard </em>feels like the <em>Dragon Age</em> I’ve been waiting for</strong></h2><p>After waiting 10 years and hearing reports of drastic shifts in the project, I was naturally concerned about whether we’d get a satisfactory continuation of Solas’ story. According to creative director John Epler, abandoning that plot thread was never in the cards, even as the game that would become <em>The Veilguard</em> went through its multiple iterations.</p><p>“At every iteration of this game, it was gonna be the hunt for Solas,” Epler told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We ended <em>Trespasser</em> with a dagger in the map on Tevinter. Those were kind of the core of [the story]. We knew we wanted to go to Northern Thedas and part of that was just we wanted to try something new, go somewhere new. And I mean, for me, Tevinter has always been this place we’ve said so much about, but we’ve never been able to show it before. So it was always like we need to go there. That makes the most sense. And then for Solas, obviously, at the end of <em>Inquisition,</em> he revealed himself as the Dread Wolf. At the end of <em>Trespasser</em>, we revealed his plan. Those two have always been a part of this game no matter what, it was always going to be about Solas to some degree and it was always going to be at least partially in Tevinter.”</p><figure id="" data-id="495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-recommend-id="image://495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-format="gif" data-width="628" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook opens a door and views the rest of The Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook opens a door and views the rest of The Lighthouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-recommend-id="image://495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-format="gif" data-width="628" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook opens a door and views the rest of The Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Tevinter and the city of Minrathous have been central to everything we’ve seen of <em>The Veilguard</em> so far, the game broadly takes place in northern Thedas, using the series’ portal-like Eluvian network to let players bounce around other distinct locations like the countries of Antiva and Rivain, which have also been spoken about in previous games but never fully explored. However, one of the ways BioWare seems to have been more measured and played to its own skill set is that <em>The Veilguard </em>doesn’t echo <em>Inquisition</em>’s open-zone structure. Nor is it quite <em>Dragon Age II</em>, which all took place in one concentrated area. Instead, what I played felt more structured like a <em>Mass Effect </em>game, utilizing bespoke missions and environments that tell contained stories that flow back into the main one.<br></p><p>One of the best examples was the recruitment mission for Lucanis Dellamorte, the Antivan assassin found in an underwater prison. Not part of one of the cities I’d already seen, it was a sequestered area that didn’t feel like it was caving under the scale of an open-world structure. <em>The Veilguard </em>has smaller environments that are densely packed with things to care about, rather than a lot of empty space for you to ride through on horseback while trying to get to the shit that matters. It feels like BioWare is working with a reasonable scale to cater to its strengths. After wasting hours of my life moving through <em>Inquisition</em>’s Hinterlands forests or <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s harsh Elaaden deserts, I can’t begin to describe how refreshing it was to just get to the heart of what I came here for with ease.</p><figure id="" data-id="18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-recommend-id="image://18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard faction menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard faction menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-recommend-id="image://18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard faction menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The action-based combat, meanwhile, feels more comparable to that of <em>Mass Effect </em>than <em>Dragon Age</em>, for better or worse. You have two companions rather than the previous three, and unlike in previous games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515">you can’t swap control to them</a></span> to change up how you play. This is certainly a change that’s hard to swallow for long-time fans, and when I heard this news, I was concerned about what we’d gain in this trade-off. But as it turns out, I never encountered an enemy or situation that merited switching off my Rook to play as Harding, the ice mage Neve, or any of the other companions I fought alongside in my seven hours of play.</p><p>In a vacuum, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like an exceptionally solid action RPG, but it’s not designed to feel evocative of previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games, and I know that will rub some the wrong way. However, I don’t feel like I’ve lost anything in not being able to swap to companions, because the game seems thoughtfully designed so that you’ll never need to. Here, your teammates act more or less as cooldown machines, dropping in their own abilities at your command and helping you execute combos. They’re here to support you, rather than offering skill sets you’ll want or need to deploy yourself. There’s an enjoyable synergy to the teamwork that comes from moments like using my Ultimate ability to gather enemies together in a black hole while ordering Neve to freeze all of them in place with an ice spell. It doesn’t feel quite like <em>Dragon Age </em>as we know it, but it still feels <em>really</em> good to set up combos alongside your team. But <em>The Veilguard </em>also probably makes me feel the most independent I’ve ever felt in fights in <em>Dragon Age</em>, and that’s coming from a career mage player.<br></p><p>Every class in <em>The Veilguard </em>feels more versatile than it has in the past, in keeping with the baseline action combat BioWare has designed. Whether you’re a warrior, mage, or rogue, you get two weapon sets that you can switch between on the fly. Warriors can use a standard “sword and board” build or change to a two-handed axe. Rogues can go back and forth between dual daggers or a bow. Mages, however, sported the most interesting kit I saw during the preview. My Rook started with a staff that felt like <em>The Veilguard</em>’s version of the previous games’ long-range mage builds. But I was also able to swap to a dagger-and-orb build that let me fight at mid-range with a magical sphere I was able to throw back and forth to keep enemies at a comfortable distance. Then, if they got too close, I still had my dagger in hand.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-recommend-id="image://ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-format="gif" data-width="441" data-height="296" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook uses an orb-and-dagger build to fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook uses an orb-and-dagger build to fight an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-recommend-id="image://ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-format="gif" data-width="441" data-height="296" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook uses an orb-and-dagger build to fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Those parallels and the inherent versatility of each class have naturally made some of the more methodical teamplay of previous games slip through the cracks, but BioWare says the rest of the RPG elements are meant to make it more than a hack-and-slash game for those that want to create builds.</p><p>“We’ve always had different combat styles for each <em>Dragon Age</em> game, but the two focuses have always been moment-to-moment gameplay needs to feel fluid and there needs to be that strategic layer,” Epler said. “And I think once you start getting especially into the skill trees, once you start getting into companion abilities, there is still a lot of that strategy in this game. And especially as you get to harder difficulties. You either need to be very, very good at the moment-to-moment gameplay or you need to dive deep into the strategic layer to succeed.”</p><p>While <em>Mass Effect </em>is an easy in-house comparison to make, Epler told me that games like <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>were a big influence on <em>The Veilguard</em>’s world construction, and the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. </em>games were a surprising inspiration for environments like Arlathan Forest as “this weird magical Chernobyl where things have gone wrong.” Of course, BioWare has also been looking at its own history, but the specific game that Epler cited the most from the studio’s own past is a surprisingly divisive one.</p><p>2011’s <em>Dragon Age II</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/not-everyone-hates-dragon-age-ii-you-know-5875251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/not-everyone-hates-dragon-age-ii-you-know-5875251">one of the most divisive games BioWare’s put out</a></span>. The sequel was notorious for its crunched development, and it shows in its smaller scale and reuse of environmental assets. It has some pretty interesting ideas, though, too; ideas that I can’t help think about as I play <em>The Veilguard</em>. It was more action-oriented, more self-contained, taking place as it did in one city, and it’s the most companion-driven story in the franchise. <em>The Veilguard </em>is unapologetically an action-RPG, stripping away the open-zone structure of <em>Inquisition</em>, and it’s brought back the divisive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">“free-for-all” romance mechanics of <em>DA2</em></a></span>. It even falls back into <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s dialogue system, in which you choose from three distinct “personalities” of nice, sarcastic, and aggressive, complete with the same icons on its dialogue wheel. Given all of this, I can’t help but feel like <em>The Veilguard </em>is a spiritual successor to one of the more controversial games in BioWare’s portfolio. Epler says that each of the past <em>Dragon Age</em> games served as an influence, but <em>DA2 </em>and its party dynamic have been one of the biggest inspirations as the team decided what lessons to take from the sequel’s reception over the years.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-recommend-id="image://cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-format="gif" data-width="627" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks to Harding and Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks to Harding and Neve." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-recommend-id="image://cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-format="gif" data-width="627" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks to Harding and Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“I think, for me, it’s a lot of the foundations of [<em>Dragon Age II</em> that influenced the team],” Epler said. “A lot of the ideas behind the characters, especially around the way that the companions were handled and how they felt over the course of the game [as you] built this group that [we looked back on]. There were more interactions between companions than there were in pretty much every other <em>Dragon Age</em> game. <em>DAI</em> had the Wicked Grace game, <em>DAO</em> had back-and-forth between characters at camp, but <em>DA2</em> is the one that really focused on, ‘These are people with their own lives.’”</p><p>For the folks at BioWare, there still seems to be a lot of love for <em>Dragon Age II</em> despite its troubled development and mixed reception. Asked if there was anxiety or concern about drawing on such a divisive game, Epler says that looking back on it for <em>The Veilguard</em> is just about making a judgment call on what was worthwhile to revisit and what shortcomings may have just been a result of the development parameters the team was given.</p><p>“I don’t know if there’s so much anxiety, it’s just something where you want to make sure you’re drawing the right lessons and not drawing the wrong lessons from it. It was at the end of the day, it was a game made in a very short period of time. A lot of that was, I wouldn’t say failures of execution, it was executed as best as it could be, but it could never be necessarily executed better than that.”</p><h2 id="h108"><a id=""></a><strong>Back to basics</strong></h2><p>Game director Corinne Busche said during a developer Q&amp;A after our demo that <em>Dragon Age</em>’s constant reinvention of itself has been the “greatest challenge” and the “most interesting opportunity” for her, and said picking and choosing what to bring with them from previous games was a key question throughout <em>The Veilguard</em>’s development. Whether it’s small things like Rook’s six possible backgrounds feeling like an homage to the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> or larger-scale design philosophies like the fast-paced combat of <em>Dragon Age II</em> clearly influencing that of <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“I think I could speak for the entirety of the team that our hope is that this all comes together to respect where we’ve been, but also advance the franchise into this next adventure into Thedas,” Busche said.</p><figure id="" data-id="bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-recommend-id="image://bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks down a bar full of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks down a bar full of enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-recommend-id="image://bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks down a bar full of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From what I played, I believe that it will. I don’t think I would have believed that if <em>The Veilguard </em>had been a live-service multiplayer game. I have spent the past 10 years feeling cynical about <em>Dragon Age</em>, as I long feared it wouldn’t be able to deliver the conclusion I was looking for, and with each passing year my cynicism only grew. 2017’s <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> brought me back home to my favorite world in video games, but was chasing open-world and live-service trends in the margins of what, with proper scaling, could have been a better game. <em>Anthem </em>confirmed my fears that a studio which had created worlds I’d spent thousands of hours in and thousands of hours thinking about had been devoured by the hunt for the next big live-service phenomenon. Now, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels both like a calculated return to familiar territory and a bold declaration of what the studio should have been making these past 10 years. </p><p>It’s a shame it took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-4-bioware-layoffs-1850766754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-4-bioware-layoffs-1850766754">all this strife to get here</a></span>, but playing those seven hours made me more confident than I’ve felt in years that this team has its head on straight again. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>might not be the game some fans want, but it feels like the game BioWare needs. </p><p><strong>Order <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Age-Veilguard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DCMN43SC/ref=sr_1_2?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0DCMN43SC" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmVgRGrbQVc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmVgRGrbQVc" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-age-the-veilguard---playstation-5%2F410967.html%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dfeeds%26utm_campaign%3D%2524PLA_%2524NB_MNFR_Video%2520Game%2520Software_Electronic%2520Arts_Preorders%26utm_id%3D16244983656%26gad_source%3D4%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgCloL8XKU85XT7iIahydmSiRcd_4HWnZLqfNTxE516yvYnR6qHEqYZPhoC4pcQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-age-the-veilguard---playstation-5%2F410967.html%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dfeeds%26utm_campaign%3D%2524PLA_%2524NB_MNFR_Video%2520Game%2520Software_Electronic%2520Arts_Preorders%26utm_id%3D16244983656%26gad_source%3D4%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgCloL8XKU85XT7iIahydmSiRcd_4HWnZLqfNTxE516yvYnR6qHEqYZPhoC4pcQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span></p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony is celebrating the 30th anniversary of PlayStation this year, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with it comes the launch</a> of a new special edition PlayStation 5 (PS5) console. The new special edition consoles will be PlayStation gray, and will be available in the PS5 Digital and PS5 Pro.</p>



<p>In addition to the new consoles, Sony is also releasing a PlayStation gray DualSense controller, PlayStation Portal, and even a PlayStation-style cable connector that looks similar to the original controller connections.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you get one of the special edition consoles, you will get the DualSense, cable connector, a vertical stand, a special edition poster, PlayStation shape cable ties, a console cover for the attachable disc drive, a paperclip, and a sticker. Should you get the PS5 Pro version, your controller will be a DualSense Edge instead of the traditional DualSense. You’ll also get a DualSense charging station.</p>



<p>Sony says it is making just 12,300 30th anniversary PS5 Pro consoles, and each will be specially numbered. The consoles and the controllers will also have a special 30th anniversary logo on them.</p>



<p>Should you not want the consoles, you can get the PlayStation Gray DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers separately. Pre-orders for the 30th Anniversary Edition consoles will begin on September 26. As of publishing, no pricing was announced. This story will be updated when that information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-bioware-finally-nails-the-character-creator-ive-always-wanted<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After ten years, we’re now just a little over a month away from playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard. I played a hefty seven hours of BioWare’s first original game since Anthem in 2019 and fourth mainline installment in the Dragon Age series, starting with the prologue and later loaded into several different saves. As a longtime fan, what I’ll say is ten years is a very long time but so far, The Veilguard hasn’t disappointed.</p><h3>Getting Into Character</h3><p>Now, I could talk to you about the combat (and I will) or the gorgeous locales (that’s coming too) or the way it felt to see Varric  and Solas again. Or I could skip straight to the character creator and start with: There’s. So. Much. Hair. Look, I loved Dragon Age: Inquisition, but fans have long acknowledged the limitations of its character creator. The Veilguard blew me away in that regard. After the lackluster options of the last entry, it’s wild to see what we’ve got to look forward to. Thirty hair options for Qunari and 88 for non-Qunari, complete with gorgeous physics as Rook scurries through Northern Thedas. So many different hair textures are represented, whether you’d like totally straight hair, 2B waves or 4C curls. In making my character, I was drawn immediately to a long braid that whipped around as quickly as I did. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Qunari horns also see a massive improvement. With 49 unique styles, options range from large and imposing to decorative or even asymmetrical. That said, yes, their foreheads can look pretty jarring. I played as a Qunari mage during most of my preview and will say I got used to the look pretty quickly. Drago n Age: The Veilguard actually only marks the second game of the series where you can play as a Qunari, so the odd imbalance of forehead versus face feels like stylistic growing pains. I remain curious about whether more time with the character creator might help. The Arishok of Dragon Age 2 is, in my opinion, such a beautifully crafted model and I would love to be able to create a Qunari Rook that feels as memorable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every aspect of your Rook is editable, even allowing for facial asymmetry if you choose.</p></div><p>Customization certainly doesn’t stop at hair (or horns) of course. Every aspect of your Rook is editable, even allowing for facial asymmetry if you choose. Sliders allow you to change everything from head shape to the melanin in your skin to the presence of vitiligo. Perhaps my favorite addition, however, is the introduction of body diversity. Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur’s Gate 3 had whiffs of this, but nowhere near what you’re capable of in The Veilguard, which is much more similar to the breadth of the character creator in Dragon’s Dogma 2. For each of the four races, there are plenty of presets to choose from, all with varying heights and muscle/fat distribution. Once you’ve chosen your preset, however, you can build further upon those elements as much as you’d like. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>First is a triangulation of coordinates allowing for many unique combinations of body types that are thinner, larger, or more muscular. Height sliders are fun – especially when it means watching my particularly short elf ruin years of Solas’ ritual planning by pushing over a statue. The options feel almost endless. There’s even a glute slider and, yes, I gave my Rook one hell of an ass. All of this is only scratching the surface. I haven’t even gotten into facial hair, makeup, scars or tattoos. As an elf, my Rook sported` some vallaslin, but there are so many different designs for both the face and the body to experiment with. </p><p>While I didn’t spend very much time exploring customization for the Inquisitor, I just know we’ll all get the chance to make them in the way we’ve always imagined. Also, it may be a relief to some of you to know that Veilguard abandons the awful green lighting of Inquisition’s character creator and instead allows you to cycle through several lighting options in service of creating Rooks that look just as good in gameplay as they do when you create them. </p><h3>Fighting Chance</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Combat, meanwhile, was a refreshing change from DA:I. My go-to class has always been mage, and even as a Knight-Enchanter I often felt like I was standing in one place holding down the left trigger. This felt like a return to the pace of DA2, with innovations that improve upon the experience of battle overall. The Veilguard introduces a new fighting style for mages featuring an orb and dagger tailored for close-quarters combat. It’s tailor-made for players like me who love magic but, also, really like to stab. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat was a refreshing change from Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p></div><p>During my preview, I played through the prologue and then dropped forward into various points of Act 1, so I really got to quickly experience the progression Rook and their companions can go through as fighters. We may not be able to take control of our companions this time around, but The Veilguard really encourages strategizing with them. They’ll call out to you when they’ve rebuilt their mana or stamina, and the ability wheel even suggests combos. My focus during the event was mission-driven so I didn’t get as much of a chance to interact with the characters as I would have liked, but even the brief moments of banter endeared me to them pretty quickly. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>Each class gets its own ultimate ability (think the Focus ability) along with a ranged attack – for warriors that means yeeting your shield like a giant metal boomerang. I’ve always played Dragon Age for story and not combat, but with this new system I had so much fun. I felt present during every encounter and truly accomplished after every boss battle. That said, there’s definitely a bit of a learning curve. I still found myself confusing controls a few hours in. It’s a departure from all three previous installments, but luckily The Veilguard offers five different difficulty levels that you can change at will if you want to ease yourself in. </p><h3>The Dragon Age-Free Decade Ends Soon </h3><p>As a longtime fan, The Veilguard felt like a homecoming of sorts. Just as much as seeing familiar faces in Solas and Varric, I was overjoyed to be back in the world of Thedas itself. Moving us north allows for that sense of discovery I got in Inquisition, and if I’d encourage anything it’s to really look at your surroundings. Not only are there small environmental puzzles to untangle along with small and effective moments of visual storytelling, but the horizon is full of breathtaking scenery that drives home the scale of these locations I’ve personally always wondered about. One new locale, for instance, is a gorgeous underwater prison called the Ossuary. I won’t spoil what you’re there to do, but the design alone makes it one of the most memorable moments I’ve had in any Dragon Age game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even after hours of gameplay, I still felt like I could have played for many hours more. I’m optimistic about The Veilguard and excited for it in a way I haven’t quite felt about another game in quite some time.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-the-final-preview.985677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Dragon Ball Tenkaichi series is one that meant a lot to me as a teenager and young adult – which was about the peak of my obsession with Dragon Ball Z – but it’s also one that I haven’t really thought about or touched in the last 15 or so years. Fast forward to the present, and after about three hours of hands-on time with Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero, it felt like I was hit with a spirit bomb of nostalgia as I once again got back in there, chaining together rapid movement teleports, bouncing my foes like ping pong balls between multiple vanishing attacks, and kicking them away with so much force that they destroy mountains. It was like reuniting with a dear old friend, and yet, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero feels like much more than just a nostalgia play. It’s packed with new mechanics, a brand new approach to story mode, and a host of other exciting features that I only got a taste of, but I’m excited to dig more into once it comes out next month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first two hours of my hands-on time was spent on freeplay. I used a large chunk of this time to refamiliarize myself with the Tenkaichi style of gameplay by hitting up Sparking Zero’s exhaustive tutorial mode, which covers all of the many many mechanics present here. There are Vanishing Assaults, Vanishing Attacks, Lightning Attacks, Burst Smashes, Dragon Smashes, high guards, low guards, high speed evasion counters, perception counters, super counters, z-counters, and so on. It’s a lot to take in for sure, but it all serves to enhance the depth of the combat, and most importantly, deliver on the power trip of controlling some of the most powerful characters throughout all of anime. Sure, I might not NEED to know how to knock an enemy away, vanish behind them, drill them into the ground, and then pick them back up and hurl them away like a ragdoll – there are other, simpler ways to get just as much damage, if not more – but doing stuff like that feels so incredibly cool, and to me, that’s what the Tenkaichi series is all about. </p><p>Once I was back up to speed on the combat and mechanics, I decided to check out one of Sparking Zero’s big new modes outside of its story mode: Custom Battles. It lets you create, share, and play out your own fantasy Dragon Ball fight scenarios – complete with options to create an intro cutscene, a title card, mid-match triggers, and outro cutscenes that cover what happens when you win, and when you lose. There’s even a Mario Maker-style rule to it, where in order to share your Custom Battle with other players, you need to be able to prove that it’s possible by beating it yourself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to craft my own battle to the degree that I would have wanted, so I opted instead to see what the mode was capable of by trying out some pre-made battles that were prepped by the developers. And to my delight, they were a lot of fun, with a great variety of different types of fights. Some were simply based around the idea of pitting certain characters against each other: like a battle of speed demons that had you controlling Burter as you faced off against Kakunsa and Hit. Another had you as Kid Goku going up against Master Roshi to relive one of their training sessions, and forcingforced you to win the fight specifically with whatever move Roshi calls out.by using a Kamehameha.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Custom Battles have great potential as a sandbox for creative players to come up with and share exciting fights that go far beyond the limits of Dragon Ball's canon.</p></div><p>My favorite, though, had me playing as a weak and underpowered Captain Ginyu against an appropriately overpowered Frieza. My only hope for victory was using Ginyu’s ultimate technique, the body-change beam, to swap bodies with Frieza and then easily finish the fight. Easier said than done, as whenever I tried to power up to be able to use the move, Frieza would hit me with an instant-kill death beam. So I had to engage with Frieza in combat just enough to be able to charge my meter, knock him away, and then use that time to charge up into Sparking Mode so I could look for an opening to land the attack. It was a surprisingly tense and refreshingly unique battle, and a great showing of the potential that this mode has as a sandbox for creative players to come up with and share exciting fights that go far beyond the limits of Dragon Ball’s canon. </p><h2>On the Next Episode of Dragon Ball Z</h2><p>After the time for freeplay was up, I got a chance to check out a handful of Episode Battles, which collectively make up Sparking Zero’s story mode. Dragon Ball’s story has been told an ungodly number of times at this point across pretty much all forms of media, but what makes Sparking Zero’s interpretation especially cool is how it gives you multiple opportunities to do things differently from how they’re supposed to go. Right from the start of Goku’s episode battle, when Raditz takes Gohan away and Goku and Piccolo give chase, you actually don’t have to join forces with Piccolo. You’re given the option to instead go it alone, and if you do that, then you’ll be joined by Krillin and fight Raditz in a battle with a completely different outcome. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s not all either. Even if you decide to play it by the canon and team up with Piccolo, if you manage to defeat Raditz before Piccolo is able to charge his attack, you’ll be met with a special fully animated and voiced “Sparking Episode” that plays out this “what if” scenario of Goku surviving his encounter with Raditz, getting to train Gohan himself, and being there right when the Saiyans arrive on Earth. </p><p>Producer Jun Furutani told me that when selecting the battles that they wanted to highlight in Episode Mode, they wanted to focus on the battles that highlighted the playable characters the best in the story, but they also wanted to put a focus on battles that could potentially lead to branching outcomes.</p><p>I followed up and asked Furutani about how substantial these branches could be, to which he replied, “It's a really hard question to answer because depending on which branch we're talking about, it could skew very in a completely different direction. But some branches might just go back to the actual canonical route again. For example, when you fight Raditz, there's some smaller branches that have been there, but it takes you back to the canonical route. And obviously after Raditz is Vegeta and after Vegeta is Frieza. Some of them are just blips, some of them kind of take you in a very drastically different direction.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And while there are eight characters that make up Sparking Zero’s Episode Battle mode, they do seem to vary wildly in terms of length. I played 30 minutes of Goku’s and only got through the Saiyan saga; 30 minutes of Frieza’s only got me to the final battle against Super Saiyan Goku; and then 30-45 minutes of Future Trunks’ story from Dragon Ball Super pretty much finished it all up right there. Still, I’m very much looking forward to diving into all of these at launch and seeing if I can find all of the hidden “what if” moments myself. It’s worth mentioning too that they’re not easy to trigger. The fights themselves are already pretty tough, and to try and accomplish specific added challenges on top of that makes it seem like these are meant as rewards for the most dedicated players – doubly so because you can’t actually trigger these scenes if you lower the difficulty. </p><p>Beyond the Custom and Episode Battle modes, I also messed around with the tournament mode, which allows you to participate in one of many different types of tournaments, each with different rule sets. The Tournament of Power, for example, has you competing on the Tournament of Power stage with flight turned off and ringouts as an alternate win condition; Cell Games is a strictly 1v1 affair with no rules, but you only regain 20% of your life between fights; and Yamcha Games is straight chaos with random rules and random character selection. You can also create your own tournament and customize your very own set of rules as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And then finally there’s the encyclopedia mode, which I got to exclusively check out for a few minutes. It’s a returning feature from Tenkaichi 3, but instead of just having Chichi giving commentary on a character, this time you get Chichi, Bulma, and Videl all gossiping about the cast and giving their own little insights. The little bits I got to listen to were all very amusing, like the girls commentating on how ugly Goku becomes when he transforms into his Super Saiyan 3 form, or how Garlic Jr. looks like a roided-out Emperor Pilaf. </p><p>My relatively short time with Sparking Zero rekindled my love for the Budokai Tenkaichi games and was a much needed reminder that arena fighters can excite and thrill just as much as traditional 2D and 3D fighters can. The attention to detail here is phenomenal; the combat definitely has a learning curve, but is packed full of depth that is very satisfying to learn and engage with; and its story looks to provide a ton of flexibility in how it tells the tale of Dragon Ball. We’ll see how its final form turns out when Dragon Ball Sparking Zero releases next month on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p><p>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

This comes despite Tango Gameworks, developer of The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo alongside Hi-Fi Rush, not having "big success" with its games.</p><p>"We wanted to maintain their legacy," Kim said. "Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organization."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank.</p></div><p>He continued: "We're trying to increase our portfolio lineup and Tango Gameworks comes into play [there]. We can't acquire Tango Gameworks based on their financials or their numbers, right? We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank.</p><p>"But it's part of our attempt. We have to keep trying in the spirit of challenge taking. Tango Gameworks are creative. They want to try something new, and we want to do more of that. [Making] video games is really a hit or miss industry, and that is risk taking. But having more project lineups is actually a way to mitigate risk, because one of them might work out."</p><p>Kim said that Tango Gamework's previous games "may not even have broken even" and the deal to acquire the studio was "not too expensive, or cheap either." Definitive numbers can't be shared until the deal goes through, but "the dollar amount was not really important to Microsoft," he said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Hi-Fi Rush Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton announced its intention to buy Tango Gameworks on August 13</a>, three months after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft announced its closure alongside other studios and lay-offs</a>. Only the Hi-Fi Rush intellectual property was brought over with Tango Gameworks, however.</p><p>Kim said this was because it knew Hi-Fi rush was the priority for fans and it didn't want to add too much to the deal and overcomplicate things. This would cause it to move slowly and add to the stress of already "anxious" employees.</p><p>"Because Hi-Fi Rush fans really want to see sequels, we negotiated with Tango Gameworks' parent company to acquire that IP as well," he said. "We wanted to make sure the deal happens fast to minimize that gap in [employees' careers]."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much.</p></div><p>Kim added: "If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much. Krafton is a pretty big company, but Microsoft is very complicated. We wanted to help the team continue developing their games, but especially Hi-Fi Rush. When I think about our fans, I think what they really care about is Hi-Fi Rush sequels."</p><p>Hi-Fi Rush certainly appeared to be a breakout hit for Tango Gameworks, breaking the mold of its horror game roots as a colorful rhythm action game. "Hi-Fi Rush marches to the beat of its own drum with stunning animation, loveable characters, and stylish rhythmic action that are anything but one-note," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review">IGN said in our 9/10 review</a>.</p><p>Microsoft itself said the game was a success too, despite it shadow dropping the game with no marketing. Microsoft executive Aaron Greenberg declared the game "was a breakout hit for [Xbox] and [its] players in all key measurements and expectations." He said Microsoft "couldn’t be happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered" when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-hi-fi-rush-hits-2-million-players">it hit two million players after a month</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review">received high praise from critics</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But just over a year later the studio was shut down. "So this is how it ends," wrote Tango Gameworks creative director and Hi-Fi rush director John Johanas on <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjohanas/status/1787877169504391613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>. "Unfortunately I don't quite have the words. But at least thank you to everyone who supported us."</p><p>Krafton kept the studio alive though, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/around-50-of-100-tango-gameworks-staff-moving-over-to-krafton">brought over around 50 of the 100 staff members</a>. It's unclear why the remaining approximately 50 staff didn't join Krafton, but it's possible they had already found jobs elsewhere as the studio's closure was announced three months earlier.</p><p>Kim made clear Krafton had no plans to lower the number of staff, and even suggested an expansion was on the cards.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
