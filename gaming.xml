            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcanas-ninth-set-fabled-to-be-released-in-september-2025-with-a-goofy-movie-and-the-first-iconic-and-epic-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana just revealed a ton of new info for the future of the trading card game, including that the ninth set - Fabled - will be released on September 5, 2025, with the first-ever Iconic and Epic cards and the long-awaited arrival of A Goofy Movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Fabled, more details were shared on Lorcana's eighth set - Reign of Jafar - ahead of its debut on June 6, a new Collection Starter Set was revealed, and details on the Disney Lorcana World Championship were given. Oh, and we can't forget about the tease of Darkwing Duck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of exciting info was unveiled for Disney Lorcana, and we're here to break it down to ensure you don't miss a thing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fabled Will Add Iconic and Epic Cards, A Goofy Movie, and Rotating Cards for Competitive Play</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-fabled-a-goofy-movie-image-1746510989873.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While we still have more to learn about Fabled, the teases given by the Disney Lorcana team are making the wait until pre-release on August 29 and wide release on September 5 just that much harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Goofy Movie cards will be one of the biggest additions to Disney Lorcana with Fabled, but the team wasn't ready to share exactly which cards will become available. They did share, however, that Mickey and Minnie will be the very first Iconic Cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iconic Cards will be the rarest cards in all of Lorcana, as only two will appear in each set going forward, and beautiful cards of Mickey and Minnie on a carousel will serve as the Iconic Cards all players will be chasing for their sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Iconic Cards will be Epic Cards, which are rarer than Legendary but not as hard to get as Enchanted and Iconic. These cards will also feature special artwork and foil treatments and will give players even more chances to score a special card like a new Elsa (Snow Queen) one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big change in Fabled is that it will mark the first time Lorcana will be rotating out certain cards and making them illegal for competitive play. Top-level competitive play is called Core Constructed and will not allow players to use any cards from the first four sets of Lorcana. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Fabled Cards and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of older cards shouldn't worry too much though, as there will be plenty of ways to play your older cards, including in a new format called Infinity Constructed. Furthermore, Fabled will introduce reprinted cards from earlier sets - like Winnie the Pooh (Hunny Wizard) - and those will be fully usable in competitive play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To keep the competitive game thriving, rotating out older cards to encourage new strategies and fresh deck designs is a really important part of the next chapter,” said Ryan Miller, Brand Manager and Co Designer of <em>Disney Lorcana</em> <em>TCG</em> at Ravensburger. “But because we know there are cards in those early sets that are important to a lot of fans’ deck-building strategies, and we know not everybody got the cards they wanted the first year, we’re re-printing some cards from those first sets in <em>Fabled</em>. Including Enchanted versions of some fan favorites!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are new to Lorcana and all of these new sets sound enticing and wonderful, the team has announced a new way to jump into this trading card game with the Collection Starter Set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This set includes four Fabled booster packs, a Tinker Bell (Giant Fairy) "Glimmer Foil" Promo Card, one card portfolio with Mickey Mouse (Brave Little Tailor) on the front, and one collector's guide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/collection-starter-set-1746511057724.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Reign of Jafar Offers Aladdin and Bambi Cards Alongside a New Co-Op Adventure</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we previously mentioned, Reign of Jafar is Lorcana's eighth set and it will be available in pre-release on May 30 and wide release on June 6. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reign of Jafar will continue the ongoing story in Lorcana that stars the Disney villain, and the Lorcana team has given a summary of what fans can expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jafar now possesses the Hexwell Crown and, with it, he has corrupted Archazia’s Island to his wicked will," the official description reads. "Traps and illusions abound in <em>Reign of Jafar</em>, and glimmers like Jasmine – Steady Strategist and Rapunzel – High Climber will need to band together to steal back the crown and defeat the evil vizier."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Reign of Jafar Cards and Sets</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Reign of Jafar, fans will be able to jump into Illumineers' Quest: Palace Heist, which is a new "co-op experience-in-a-box" that will allow four players to team up and take on Jafar and his minion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the cards, fans will be able to try to get Bambi (Prince of the Forest), Flower (Shy Skunk), Thumper (Young Bunny), Jafar (High Sultan of Lorcana), Magic Carpet (Phantom Rug), Aladdin (Vigilant Guard), and much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teases of the Future Include Whispers in the Well and Darkwing Duck</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-whispers-in-the-well-set-art-1746511073170.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the presentation, Disney revealed that the set after Fabled will be called Whispers in the Well and it will arrive in Q4 2025. The team didn't share much, but a key art revealed Mickey, Ariel, and the likely addition of Disney Gargoyles into Lorcana. Oh, and that there is a new type of Glimmer abound. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Farther out, the team finally answered many fans' calls for Darkwing Duck to be added to Lorcana as it was confirmed he will be joining the game in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Ready For the Disney Lorcana World Championship</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The competitve scene in Lorcana is heating up as the Disney Lorcana World Championship will take place on June 28 and 29 in Walt Disney World. This major tournament will see players from around the world competing for the envious title of the first annual Disney Lorcana TCG World Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans not in attendance will be able to follow along live on Twitch.TV/DisneyLorcana with a team of casters that includes Rebekah (<em>RebekahQuests</em>), Baker (<em>LorcanaVillain</em>), Liam (<em>The Illumiteers</em>), Brandon (<em>Bsquared24</em>), and JD (<em>JDZ Quest</em>). Additionally, there will be a chance to obtain a non-foil 'A Whole New World' promo card during this time, but more details will be given in the future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-promo-a-whole-new-world-1746511087140.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tcgs">what other TCGs alongside Disney Lorcana are worth getting into</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion">our impressions of Lorcana's Archazia's Island expansion.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

                <p>The new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> trailer illuminated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">many new details about the highly anticipated open-world game</a>, including the fact that main character Jason is absolutely shredded. The trailer opens with a shirtless Jason climbing down off the roof after doing some repairs. A close-up of Jason reveals he's got cannons for arms, a built back, and some impressive chest gains.</p><p>But how much can Jason bench? A sequence later in the trailer shows Jason on the beach, throwing up some impressive weight. In the trailer, we see Jason benching what appears to be 275lbs. Using weight plates from the amazingly fictional brand "GAINZ," we can see the outer-most plate is 25lbs. The inner ones look like 45-pound plates, so all of that weight combined with the bar (we are assuming it's the standard 45 pounds) and that comes to a mighty 275 pounds.</p><p>No matter what anyone says, a 275-pound bench is <em>impressive</em>. In gym and lifting culture, a bench press of 225 is the standard for what aspiring lifters hope to achieve. Given Jason's general buff-ness, I'm not surprised to see him putting up more, and having a well-rounded physique in general.</p><p>Also worth noting here is Jason's bench press form--it is very good. He takes the bar all the way down to his chest in a slow, controlled manner, making sure to not flare his arms out but keep the tight to his body. He also seems to not drop the weight in a straight line down to his chest. We could learn a thing or two from Jason's form.</p><p>Now, we can't say for sure what Jason's <em>best</em> bench is. It's possible Jason is not maxing out here but instead pumping for volume and muscle stamina. We do hear him grunt a little, but that doesn't mean he's struggling. He gets the weight up pretty easily, after all--earning the attention of a couple women nearby, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449" data-ratio="0.52233009708738" data-width="1030" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449"></a><figcaption>Jason is getting after it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png"></figure><p>What I don't like to see here is Jason lifting all this weight without a spotter, or without a rack that has spotter arms. It's dangerous and unsafe to do this. But given Jason's line of work or robbing and shooting people as a drug-runner, it might be one of the safer activities he engages in.</p><p>Jason might be a gym bro, but we also see him in another sequence crashed out on the couch in the middle of the day with beers on his coffee table, so he clearly enjoys partying as well. Another scene shows Jason and Lucia at a club having a grand time. Remember, it's all about balance (minus the crime).</p><p>It's likely pumping out sets at the beach could be an activity in GTA 6, as Rockstar is known to allow players to do much of what they see in trailers for their games. Also, GTA 5 allowed players to hurl some weight around at an <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Muscle_Sands_Gym" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outdoor gym by the water</a> as well, so it would be in keeping with tradition.</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

        <p>Feels like they're forcing this one</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> is obviously quite busy presumably stressing over lukewarm responses to its next game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, they're still working on a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> stuff. The studio revealed a plethora of expansions today, all of which are building up a new "multi-year saga" called the Fate Saga. We'll get to it in a moment, but one of these expansions might raise an eyebrow, as it is quite literally a Star Wars crossover, but is also described by narrative designer Alison Luhrs as one that will push the Fate Saga "forward in important ways and introduce characters that we're going to spend time with for years to come."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, let's talk about the first expansion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIAAxlbFujk&amp;ab_channel=Destiny2">The Edge of Fate</a>. This one's out quite soon, July 15th, where you'll be heading to a planetoid called Kepler to "redefine our future." You'll be facing off against Fallen Corsairs and Vex Kobolds on Kepler, and you can get new abilities by binding your guardian to dark matter. On top of that, there's a bunch of new modifiers, armour is getting an update to include set bonuses and reworked stats, and gear can progress up to five tiers.

<p>
Then, there's the second expansion, Renegades. Here you'll find the Star Wars stuff, which includes you rocking a lightsaber, alongside some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJUdSgTuSMs/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and General Grievous cosmetics</a>. Honestly, this one stinks a bit. I'm a bit sick of Star Wars by now, and I already think that Destiny having any crossovers at all ruins the vibe, but for it to be a whole, important expansion that'll inevitably get vaulted? Come off it. If you're not as put off as I am, this one is due out December 2.

<p>
After that there's a couple more expansions to come too, one called Shattered Cycle out summer 2026, and the other being The Alchemist in winter 2026. You might notice that that's two expansions a year, which certainly is a lot, but there's big questions as to whether that'll be enough to bring people back. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has struggled quite a bit in recent years, not to mention the fact that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">down by a lot of staff</a> compared to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">couple of years ago</a>, so this certainly feels like a push to get back on track. Fingers crossed for the team more than anything else.

Here’s what’s new, how long the games take to beat, and which platforms the <em>Lunar Remastered Collection</em> is available for. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,196055,195755" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#new&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#new">What’s new in the remastered collection?</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#silverstar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#silverstar">How long is <em>Lunar: Silver Star Story</em>?</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#blue&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#blue">How long is <em>Lunar 2: Eternal Blue</em>?</a></span><br>4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#platforms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#platforms">Platforms</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h30283"><a id="new"></a>What’s new in <em>Lunar Remastered Collection</em>?</h2><p><em>Lunar Remastered Collection</em> features a wide variety of quality of life upgrades over the original versions of these classic role-playing titles.

Though it may lack the polish of many of the games it borrows ideas from, it provides compelling enough gameplay that genre fans may find it worth their time to see how things play out for main character Zoe and her little drone, Koby. But how much time will you need to invest exactly? Let’s take a look at how long it takes to beat <em>Steel Seed</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,197551,197550" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h28155"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Steel Seed</em>?</h2><p><em>Steel Seed</em> is a pretty linear game with <strong>a clear and focused campaign that should take the average player somewhere between 10-12 hours to complete</strong>. That game length doesn’t take into account finding its many collectibles, buying every upgrade, and other optional tasks.</p><p>And yeah, there is a decent amount of extra stuff to do in <em>Steel Seed</em> if you want to go for full completion. For those who enjoy collecting everything in this type of game, though, that won’t be a bad thing, especially since it’s all relatively straightforward.</p><p>You’ll need to buy every upgrade in the game from each of the three skill trees. You’ll also need to find all 114 glitch crystals, as well as various health modules, drones, notes, and more as you explore levels. In other words, you’ll have plenty to look for when you’re not engaged in the game’s stealth and action gameplay. You should expect a completionist run to add another two or three hours.</p><p>If you’re going for every trophy or achievement in <em>Steel Seed</em>, you’ll definitely have to do all of the above—and then some. You’ll need to eliminate a certain number of specific enemy types, ensure you kill 50 enemies using your drone, and even play a couple of melodies on a piano at some point in the game. </p><p>Whether you want to do everything in the game or simply see the campaign through, you can pick up <em>Steel Seed</em> now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For other games, a publisher might begin preorders after confirming a release date and posting a flashy trailer to capitalize on the hype. But no, that's not the case for GTA 6.</p><p>Although we now know GTA 6 is set for release on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, retailers are not yet taking preorders. You should avoid any retailer currently trying to take your money to reserve the game, as it's likely a scam.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Rest assured, when Rockstar announces preorder details for GTA 6, we'll report back with all the details. In addition to a standard version, it's expected Rockstar will offer premium-edition versions of the game, just like it did with GTA 5.</p><p>For comparison, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o349k552573918/grand-theft-auto-v-now-officially-available-for-preorder.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preorders for GTA 5 opened in November 2012</a>, which was after the first trailer arrived in November 2011. GTA 6, meanwhile, has already had two trailers, the first of which was released in December 2023; the second debuted on May 6, 2025.</p><p>In addition as to when GTA 6 preorders will open, another major unanswered question is how much GTA 6 might cost. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">some AAA games jumping from $70 to $80</a>, many are wondering if GTA 6 will follow suit or even potentially go higher, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">like $100</a>, as some believe might happen. GTA 5 launched in 2013 priced at $60; that's about $80 in 2025 with inflation factored in.</p><p>Take-Two, many might recall, was the first major publisher to raise prices for AAA games from $60 to $70 with NBA 2K21.

There’s a lot to see and do in this densely packed world. It can feel a little overwhelming at times. So, before you set off on your journey, here are four tips to get you started in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet.</em></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,197551,197550" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#scan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#scan">Buy upgrades early</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#survey&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#survey">Survey often</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#research&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#research">Get to researching</a></span><br>4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#death&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#death">Recover your gear after death</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h22319"><a id="scan"></a>Buy the Scanner and Survey Tool upgrades ASAP</h2><figure id="" data-id="ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-recommend-id="image://ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut scans a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An astronaut scans a tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-recommend-id="image://ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut scans a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Many of the upgrades in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> are unlocked via story progress and are required to complete the game. However, there are some optional improvements you can make early on that’ll make a difference. </p><p>The Scanner and Survey Tool enhancements in the Suit tree are some the most important, as these are vital to your exploration. For the Scanner, you’ll want to grab “Intelli-Visor Upgrade” to improve the range of your Scanner. And for your Survey Tool, make sure you pick up “The ‘Fancy Nancy’ Equipment Tagger” so that using Survey will let you tag nearby Supply Crates and Orange Goo, and “Survey Range Booster” to increase the range you can do so.</p><p>Oh, and don’t pass up “Landing Impact Nullifier” in the Suit tree either, as it’ll completely eliminate fall damage. You’ll be doing a lot of exploring at high altitudes, so you’ll be thankful you don’t take damage when you take a tumble down a mountain.</p><h2 id="h22320"><a id="survey"></a>Survey, survey, survey</h2><figure id="" data-id="5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-recommend-id="image://5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-recommend-id="image://5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of the Survey Tool, make sure you’re spamming it as you explore new areas by clicking in the right stick on the controller (or whatever key it is on PC for those of you using a typing device to control a video game). Once you have the upgrades listed above, you’ll be able to tag a lot of nearby collectibles, as well as ping any veins in the vicinity that you can destroy for materials.</p><p>A lot of collectibles are gated off during the early hours due to you not having the necessary upgrades to access them, but they’ll nonetheless get tagged when you survey. You can note which Supply Crates and Orange Goos are accessible to you at any given time on the map by checking to see if they have a small lock on the icon. So, even if you can’t get to them now, you’ll be very happy to have these locations tagged for you when you’re ready to return later.</p><h2 id="h22321"><a id="research"></a>Don’t put off challenges or research</h2><figure id="" data-id="582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-recommend-id="image://582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-recommend-id="image://582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll sometimes get side-quests in the form of challenges to complete. For instance, one of the earliest of these gives you a handful of tasks to perform out in the world, such as sliding a certain distance or dive bombing into water from high up. While these may seem relatively unimportant at a glance, completing them will actually unlock new blueprints at the 3D printer for some of the best weapon and movement upgrades in the game. So, ya know, don’t let these waste away in your quest log.</p><p>Meanwhile, don’t forget to research your captured creatures! Each creature you capture can be researched using the computer terminal at the habitat, and staying on top of this can earn you stuff like color schemes and upgrades. Make sure you’re checking in frequently to keep the research rolling.</p><h2 id="h22322"><a id="death"></a>Always retrieve your stuff after you die</h2><figure id="" data-id="864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-recommend-id="image://864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-recommend-id="image://864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, you’re probably gonna die in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. So get used to it. But each time you die, you’ll drop much-needed materials which can set you back quite a bit if you don’t go back for them. When this happens, you’ll receive a quest called “I Take That Back”. Immediately set this as your tracked quest, then return to the biome in which you died.</p><p>Unfortunately, your stuff is frequently not in the exact location you died but rather somewhere in that general vicinity. This can make for a more frustrating recovery, but just play things safe and follow your compass. When you reach the location of your stuff, you’ll find a loot box you can click on to grant you everything you dropped. Whew. </p><hr><p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The card game featuring iconic characters from across 100 years of Disney canon has had a strong two years of support. This preview is proof that support will continue with details on upcoming sets alongside quality-of-life changes for the competitive scene.</p>

<h2>The 2025 <em>Disney Lorcana</em> Preview</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger made several announcements as part of a <em>Disney Lorcana</em> preview. It opens by recounting the success of the game, releasing seven sets with more than 1500 unique cards for the game since its launch in 2023.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-preview-reign-of-jafar-illumineer-box-artwork.jpg?itok=UPxIA-a_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-preview-reign-of-jafar-illumineer-box-artwork.jpg?itok=0xwb1KP3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The press release then touches upon <em>Disney Lorcana's</em> eighth upcoming set: <em>Reign of Jafar</em>. It continues the story introduced in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-disney-lorcana-archazias-island-details-revealed-by-ravensburger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Archazia's Island </em></a>set. Jafar has gotten the Hexwell Crown and has used it to shape the island to his evil will. The island is now packed with dangerous traps and tricky illusions, but a resistance group, including Jasmine and Rapunzel, is trying to steal the crown back.</p>

<p>Part of this set's release includes <em>Illumineers' Quest: Palace Heist</em>. This is a co-op experience where up to four players can hold their own against Jafar's minions. The set will pre-release May 30th with a national release June 6th.</p>

<p>The <em>Disney Lorcana</em> preview also contained new details on the next set, <em>Fabled</em>. First, the set will be the first to include two new rarities to <em>Disney Lorcana</em>: Iconic and Epic. Iconic Cards are extremely rare; only two total are in the set. Iconic cards appear more often than Enchanted rarity cards and feature unique foil treatments.</p>

<p>The launch of Fabled will mark the first time cards will be rotated out of competitive play for Disney Lorcana. The first four sets will be rotated out of the Core Constructed format. But, for those that still want to experiment, a new format, Infinity Constructed, is available. This is a natural result of the game's growing competitive scene and expanding suite of cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Fabled</em> set will release September 5, 2025.</p>

The report notes that a Tarnished Pack DLC will be made available for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC, presumably with a price tag in the realm of $10-$20, though FromSoftware hasn’t confirmed that yet. We also don’t know if it will arrive on all platforms at the same time or have a brief staggered release window. <br></p><p>Still, I’m sure the over 30 million players who have already bought <em>Elden Ring</em> will be stoked to know there’s new stuff coming, and while it’s not an entirely new boss or other major piece of content, new classes and items should offer returning players some fun additional tools to experiment with. Somehow I don’t think the open-world RPG has hit its last major milestone. I also don’t think anyone would be put out if FromSoftware decided to keep sneaking out new content here and there, either. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bungie has revealed its plans for the next long story arc for Destiny 2. The developers have revealed a "multi-year saga" in the form of the Fate Saga. The beginning of this new chapter of Destiny's story, there will be four expansions to start us off known as the Year of Prophecy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">Starting on July 15, 2025 with The Edge of Fate</a>, players will journey to the mysterious planetoid Kepler and find more questions than answers about the universe at large. After that on December 2, 2025, we will get the expansion Renegades. As per Bungie's new content roadmap plans, there will now be two expansions a year going forward. So now with more densely-packed expansions than what players have seen with Episodes and less waiting time, more content will be seen quickly rather than the 1-2 year gap between expansions as before.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In between each expansion there will also be what Bungie is dubbing "Major Updates," with overhauls to the sandbox, new events, modifier and challenge updates, new gear and Artifact mods, and more. On September 9, 2025, the first major update of the Season of Reclamation, titled Ash &amp; Iron, will release. Then, as part of Renegades and the Season of Lawless, the Shadow &amp; Order update will drop on March 3, 2026. The most-enticing detail here is that each major update will not cost anything, nor will it be vaulted or taken away. Major updates will be free to all Destiny 2 players, and the content they bring will always be part of the game at large. These updates will be approximately the size of the Into the Light seasonal update with lots of events and new content to find.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489333" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489333"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not all, as we already have names for the next expansions for the Year of Prophecy going into 2026 as well.

Included among all of the massive updates coming starting this July is a customizable difficulty for destinations, which we detail in this article <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-have-customizable-location-difficulty-with-next-expansion/1100-6531337/" data-ref-id="1100-6531337">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/news/2025/05/06/major-destiny-2-reveals-metroidvania-exploration-star-wars-lightsabers-new-multi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie today pushed forward an array of new details regarding Destiny 2 and what players can expect to discover in the game over the next year. The scope and range of topics touched upon was extensive, though it’s clear that many of the more comprehensive details will arrive in other formats in the coming weeks and months. Even so, there’s a lot to unpack from what was shared.</p>

<p>Much of the stream focused on The Edge of Fate, an expansion set to arrive on July 15. The Edge of Fate takes players to a new destination – a planetoid floating through the Oort Cloud at the edge of the solar system – called Kepler. Here, players navigate a Metroidvania-inspired destination of mysteries and secrets, fueled by new powers granted through dark matter. Kepler will feature multiple world tiers of challenge that unlock over time as you play. Mysteries and puzzles might be solved one way in an early tier, only to change as you acquire new abilities and power in later tiers.</p>

<p>Kepler will also bring an array of new powers. The premier ability is called Matter Spark, which allows players to use a special pad to transform into a ball of bouncing arc energy and zip about the environment, jumping, electrocuting enemies, squeezing through tight spaces, and rolling along ramps for distant leaps. It was visually reminiscent of Samus Aran’s morph ball feature from the Metroid games.</p>

</article><p>Players also gain other new abilities on Kepler, like a Relocator Cannon that allows for teleportation through the space, and Matter Morph, which allows players to use Strand energy to reshape the environment, creating bridges, revealing secrets, and opening doors.</p>

<p>The Edge of Fate storyline is the opening salvo to a new multi-year saga from the Destiny team which they’ve dubbed the Fate Saga. As The Edge of Fate gets going, players are finally going to get more details about the mysterious entities called The Nine – a group of godlike extradimensional beings that are each individually connected to one of the major bodies in the solar system (eight planets and the Sun). We’ll see returning characters like Ikora Rey play a major role, but also new characters, including a bespectacled new character named Lodi. On a broader level, the Fate Saga appears to deal with the idea that The Nine have their own motivations that have often manipulated the Guardians to a particular fate. The new storyline questions how much the Guardians are able to alter that fate, if at all.</p>

<p>As a lead-up to the new expansion, today, Bungie is launching a new prologue chapter called the Rite of the Nine. The new event includes access to three dungeons, each at three different tiers of difficulty, aiming to be inviting to all player skill levels. The Rite of the Nine includes exclusive rewards, including a new title. And it also serves to reintroduce the Emissary – a prior character from earlier storylines that we still know very little about.</p>

<p>While we learned a good bit about the expansion, we also got a peek in today’s stream into more substantial changes coming to the core game of Destiny 2. The longtime use of “The Director” as a front page to play is being overhauled. Starting with The Edge of Fate, players will be invited to “Open Portal” to jump into a streamlined menu selection of activities, dominated by different ops split into Solo, Fireteam, Pinnacle and Crucible ops.</p>

</article><p>The overall focus for changes is on providing increased player agency, so these different ops allow for dramatic levels of activity customization, including 50 new modifiers to tweak the gameplay. As an example, we heard about a grapple modifier that gives environment navigation a Spider-Man-like feeling. For those who want a more curated experience, there are also Quickplay selections; most activities also allow for a fireteam finder.</p>

<p>Gear is also changing, including a dramatic reinvention of equipment being dubbed Armor 3.0, which includes set bonuses for armor, and the ability to fully tweak armor perks as soon as an item is acquired. Gear tiers are another major change, which see acquired gear coming in at one of five distinct tiers of quality; players who acquire a Tier 5 weapon (which are the hardest to get) will have a special shader treatment and other features that make them unmistakable as the best in a given class.</p>

<p>We also received a scattering of other info drops about what’s on the way. Some of the most important is the soon-to-arrive new Crucible mode called Heavy Metal, which pits tanks against mech-style brigs in large-scale battles; engage with this activity and you can earn the new Griffin combat vehicle, which can be equipped into your Sparrow slot. We learned of a new permanent feature of the Tower called the Shooting Range, where players can test out their builds against a variety of enemy types. Players were also shown new holofoil treatments that will come on weapons, including a slick ocean wave effect that will be available with Solstice weapons later this summer. We also learned that the new raid will launch only days after The Edge of Fate reaches players; expect to try for that world-first title on July 19.</p>

</article><p>Of all the announcements, the most surprising was the reveal of 2025’s second expansion, which we’ll learn more about through a dedicated reveal in September. Renegades is described as a full-on in-lore Destiny expansion that moves the core story forward. But it’s also described as a direct homage to the universe of <em>Star Wars</em>, and appears (among other things) to include crossover elements between the two sci-fi/fantasy properties, including Guardians wielding lightsabers. It’s safe to say that longtime Destiny fans may have strong opinions about such a direct melding of the two popular universes. Regardless, it’s clear that Bungie has robust plans for what’s to follow, as we also learned that the Fate Saga will continue into 2026 with additional expansions titled Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist.</p>

<p>There’s plenty more detail to discover through an in-depth viewing of the event; you can check out <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/year_of_prophecy_reveal_recap">Bungie’s full recap</a>, or watch an archive of the lengthy reveal event below.</p>

            <p>
May is here, and with it comes a fresh batch of additions to Xbox Games Pass' catalogue for Ultimate and Standard tier subscribers. It's quite a busy month too, bringing a number of day-one big-hitters including Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet.
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages is the headline act, of course, giving the series' classic demon-slaying action a medieval twist - including the addition of a great big bonking shield - in an adventure set before events of 2016's Doom. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-doom-the-dark-ages-reveals-another-reinvention-but-one-that-feels-less-cleanly-defined">looking pretty promising</a>. Revenge of the Savage Planet, meanwhile, is the follow up to Typhoon Studios' comedic 2020 action-adventure Journey to the Savage Planet; it retains the zany tone of its predecessor, but - as Eurogamer's Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review">his three star review</a> - is perhaps "not as wild and carefree as it wants to be".
</p>
<p>
And here's everything currently confirmed for Xbox Game Pass in May:
</p>
<h3>Out today:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dredge (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>7th May:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
<li>Dungeons of Hinterberg (Console) – Now with Game Pass Standard</li>
<li>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (Xbox Series X/S) – Now with Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>8th May:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Revenge of the Savage Planet (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>13th May:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (Cloud and Console) – Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>15th May</h3>
<ul>
<li>DOOM: The Dark Ages (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<h3>16th May</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<h3>20th May</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firefighting Simulator: The Squad (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
<li>Police Simulator: Patrol Officers (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>
But of course, where there's a hello, there's a goodbye, and May sees a number of Game Pass departures to go alongside the above additions.  Microsoft suggests prioritising the following if you've any interest in playing them before they vanish on 15th May - and notes they're available to purchase with up to 20 percent off:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Brothers A Tale of Two Sons (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Chants of Sennaar (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Dune: Spice Wars (Game Preview) (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Hauntii (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Big Con (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>Phew! That’s a lot of screenshots, right?</p>
<p>A few days ago,&nbsp;Rockstar announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">Bungie</a> hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh78HmxSq8c">showcase</a> for Destiny 2's next expansion, Edge of Fate, which will launch July 15, 2025. The showcase focused mostly on Edge of Fate, but also announced that the next major expansion to the game, the Star Wars-inspired Renegades, will arrive sometime in December 2025, and that there will be another two expansions coming in 2026, called Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist.</p>
<p>The showcase featured global communications lead Dyland Gafner, assistant game director Robbie Stevens, narrative director Alison Lurhs, art director Dave Samuel and Ben Wommack, the core creative director on the day-to-day experience of Destiny.</p>
<p>There was a lot discussed over the course of the panel, with some major changes coming to Destiny 2 with the Edge of Fate. A key one that players will appreciate, is that Bungie will no longer charge for seasonal content, meaning that when you buy the latest expansion for Destiny 2, you won't have to fork out more when the season kicks off in order to get every bit of narrative content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buh6WERf-zY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Edge of Fate will kick off what Bungie calls <strong>The Fate Saga</strong>, which will unfold over "<em>several years</em>" according to Bungie, with new and old characters at the core of the story like fan-favorite Ikora. It'll center around a group called The Nine, described as celestial bodies that have been around longer than the Traveller, and represented in each of the planets (minus Pluto) and the Sun. Edge of Fate will take players to the edge of the Sol galaxy, to a planetoid called Kepler, where players will find new dark matter abilities to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Bungie is also introducing what it calls a Metroidvania style of play with abilities like Matterspark, which allows you to transform into a rolling ball of electricity and resembles the ball that Samus herself rolls into when she's cutting through tight spaces.</p>

<p>We also got to see some environmental puzzle gameplay that'll take advantage of Matterspark and Mattermorph, an ability that lets you manipulate the environment around you.</p>
<p>As a narrative prologue to the Edge of Fate in July, three dungeons called Explorer, Eternity and Ultimatum have been made available today, for free, for all Destiny 2 players to check out and get their first glimpse at the larger story that'll kick off in Edge of Fate.</p>

<p>It's clear from the showcase that Bungie is doing what it can to continue evolving Destiny 2, specifically regarding its reputation of being too obtuse and difficult to get into if you haven't already been playing for 1,000 hours. "<em>Play your way</em>" and "<em>player agency</em>" were phrases that came up consistently throughout the showcase, and are the driving force behind changes like removing paywalls to seasonal content, gear changes, and the permanent addition of a Shooting Range.</p>
<p>The Shooting Range is a new addition to the Tower, and as the name suggests, it'll be a place where players can test out their new weapons and abilities, with damage trackers and everything you might want to really test out your new loot.</p>
<p>Ending the presentation was our first look at the December 2025 expansion, Renegades, which Bungie confirmed is directly inspired by Star Wars, and will feature lightsabers. It was described as taking the space western vibe of Star Wars and putting it through a Destiny lens, which, at least by the look of the teaser trailer, feels like an apt description.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the Edge of Fate expansion are available now for players who are keen to jump into what admittedly does look like a new beginning for Destiny, now that the Light and Dark Saga has come to an end.</p>

Additionally, the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> update, “Rite of the Nine,” is available today. A second expansion, inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> and titled <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em>, will launch in December. <span id="more-963278"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Release Schedule</strong></p><table><tbody></tbody><thead><!-- AD: content -->

Two major characters will step into the spotlight: Lodi, a new ally from a distant place, and the legendary Warlock Vanguard Ikora. <em>The Edge of Fate</em> will propel Guardians into a multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions.</p><p>The expansion will take place on Kepler, a new destination inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s dungeons and destination design, which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery. New enemies, weapons, gear, and destination-specific abilities await those brave enough to dive into its secrets.</p><p>A key feature of Kepler is the abundant dark matter energy, which powers the abilities available to the Guardian while exploring the destination. The new Matterspark ability allows Guardians to bind to dark matter to change forms, enabling them to squeeze through tight spaces, jump and dash across terrain, and become a rolling force of destruction. Additional abilities include the new Relocator Cannon, which uses Fallen dark matter tech to teleport players across the environment, and Mattermorph, which lets Guardians manipulate their surroundings using the combined forces of dark matter and Strand.</p><p>The Edge of Fate Pre-Order includes:</p><ul><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Campaign</li><li>New Raid</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li>Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li></ul><p>Year of Prophecy Edition Pre-Order includes:</p><ul><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> and <em>Renegades</em> Campaigns</li><li>New Raid and Dungeon</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>3x Rewards Passes</li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ship (available September 9, 2025)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (available September 9, 2025)</li></ul><p>Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition Pre-Order includes:</p><ul><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> and <em>Renegades</em> Campaigns</li><li>New Raid and Dungeon</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>3x Rewards Passes</li><li>Instant Unlock Exotic Sniper Rifle: New Land Beyond<ul><li>New Land Beyond Ornament and Catalyst (available at launch of <em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em>)</li></ul></li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ship (available September 9, 2025)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (available September 9, 2025)</li><li>Year of Prophecy Exotic Emote (instant unlock)</li><li>Year of Prophecy Exotic Sparrow (available July 15, 2025)</li><li>Dark Side Legends Bundle (3 full armor ornament sets, 1 for each class, instant unlock)</li><li>Secret Stash (1x Exotic Cosmetic, 1x Exotic Cipher, 2x Ascendant Alloys, 3x Ascendant Shards, delivered with each seasonal update)</li></ul><p>The <em>Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy Collector’s Edition</em> is also available for pre-order on the Bungie Store.

<p dir="ltr">There are also a number of new display options. A "Very Low" option for the game's various display settings have been added to help "improve performance" on some devices, and Bethesda has additionally added support for 32:9 and 32:10 resolutions, as well as more 16:9, 16:10, and 21: 9 resolution options.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the update, it's largely small quality-of-life tweaks or bug fixes. A new marker on the player's compass will point towards their vehicle, for example, and players can now change the keybind for the boost button. Players on Steam can opt-in to the update by right-clicking Starfield in their library, selecting Properties, and then selecting Betas to download the new beta update.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">promised fans of Starfield</a> that the team was hard at work and that there are "lots of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about."</p><p dir="ltr">What those "exciting things" will be is still unclear, but there is some recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-still-not-confirmed-but-new-evidence-emerges/1100-6530141/" data-ref-id="1100-6530141">evidence to suggest Starfield could finally be arriving on PlayStation 5</a> sooner rather than later.
