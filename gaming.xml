			<p>LEGO Voyagers might just be the cutest game ever. As my partner and I guided our adorable single-block Lego pieces though this co-op puzzle platformer, we emitted many a coo of ‘ooohhhh’ and ‘aaahhhh’, and thankfully it wasn’t followed by running and screaming. But is there more to Light Brick Studios’ latest LEGO adventure than looking disarmingly delightful?</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idgrndka0AQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Akin to the local and online co-op experience <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">offered by Hazelight Studios</a>, Lego Voyagers requires two players to work together to navigate through its isometric levels. Your eyed Lego pieces are steered like rolling wagon wheels, tumbling through the environment with clumsy abandon. Most of the levels are made up of those smooth Lego pieces that are much easier to dust on your display models than the studded ones. Though, every now and again, you’ll find some studs to attach to with the tap of a button. Like Katamari Damacy, you can end up coated in chunks of plastic, each impacting the physics of your character, causing you to trundle hilariously – and precariously – around the place.</p>


<p>Even better, both players can connect together with a stupendously satisfying ‘click’, and then can both take control of your Frankenstein-like Lego monstrosity, requiring you to work together to get around the place. It’s tremendous silly fun, and, thanks to a very quick respawn, frustration caused by the chaos is kept to an absolute minimum. Having said that, despite the kid friendly visuals, I can’t help but feel that the challenging physics-based controls might not make this one suitable to play with the smallest Lego-fans in your family.</p>


<p>Platforming is simple, which is a relief, as the isometric viewpoint prevents anything more complex. Even simple jumps are made agonisingly tricky by often being unable to tell where your player character is in the space. Once more, that aforementioned rapid respawn saves the day. Even if you’ve failed a basic jump several times or more, you’re hurled back into the action before irritation sets in.</p>
<p>In contrast to the hit and miss platforming, the puzzles are a delight, requiring both players to work together to solve numerous satisfyingly brain-ticking conundrums. One player might be tasked with controlling a bridge say, whilst the other player crosses it safely – or unsafely, if the first player is feeling cheeky. In my case, I often am.</p>
<p>The best puzzles are those that involve building something together from the random bits and bobs you find littered around the landscape. Often, you don’t quite know what you are building until suddenly the penny drops and you realise, you’re halfway through constructing a catapult to haphazardly fling your buddy over a hazardous ravine! Or, in a page straight out of Hazelight Studios’ co-op book, you’re tasked with controlling a boat together, one playing steering, the other accelerating. It’s easy charming fun, the game breezily flinging ideas at you, never waiting too long before moving onto the next one.</p>

<p>The only downside? It’s all over far too quickly. As such, it never quite feels like the game explores any one idea to a satisfying conclusion. You do a bit of something, it’s enjoyable, but it always feels like the mechanic could be further explored. Light Brick Studios clearly doesn’t want to stick with an idea too long, just in case you get bored. This, combined with a very short run time of a handful of hours, means that whilst Lego Voyagers is tremendous fun, it’s likely done and forgotten before the end credits have finished rolling.</p>

<p>The GeForce NOW RTX Blackwell upgrade started rolling out last month. You can read my impressions <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>:</p>



<p><em>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW was already by far the best cloud gaming experience available, and the RTX 5080 server upgrade, coupled with various other improvements, only increases the distance between the platform and its competitors. There is absolutely no question that, if you want to play games on the cloud, this is the way. The visual quality is now a near-match for the local experience, but the responsiveness is not. L4S adoption may help a little, but I suspect the physics limitations will remain a mostly unavoidable hurdle for the foreseeable future.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[FIFA Heroes Is an Arcade-Style 5v5 Soccer Game Coming Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-heroes-announced-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fifa-heroes-is-an-arcade-style-5v5-soccer-game-coming-next-year.1314703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soccer governing body FIFA, together with New York-based development studio Enver, has announced&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>, a new 5v5 arcade-style soccer (or "football", for the enlightened) game coming to consoles and mobile next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>will be "an arcade fast 5-a-side" game with "fantasy flair", and it'll feature iconic FIFA mascots, "football's biggest icons, and your favorite fictional characters from iconic TV shows and films".</p>

<p>Enver and FIFA are promising "dynamic physics and pitch-shattering power moves", so it's pretty clear that this isn't an&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>-style realistic simulation, as if the larger-than-life cast list outlined above didn't already give the (beautiful) game away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=TYDfcYDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=EhoOALGC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know much about&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>&nbsp;yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature both PvE and PvP play modes; Enver and FIFA say you'll be able to "tackle PvE before going head to head with your mates" across "arcade fast matches and challenges", which will also help you "progress your club through PvE career milestones".</p>

<p>If you're a football aficionado, you'll know that the World Cup next year is being held across three host countries, and each of those countries' mascots is represented here: Maple for Canada, Clutch for the US, and Zayu for Mexico.</p>

<p>They're just three of the playable characters in&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>, each of whom will have "their own super abilities and special moves", although it's not clear whether that's true of all of the playables or just the mascots.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>right here, although it's worth saying that it's more of a concept piece, since there's no identifiable gameplay in the trailer.</p>




<p><em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>is the latest officially-licensed&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>game to be announced since EA decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year" rel="nofollow">part ways with the organization</a> back in 2022, changing the name of its iconic&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>franchise to&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

<p>In October last year, FIFA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner" rel="nofollow">chose Konami as its new esports partner</a> following the split, although the governing body still hasn't chosen a flagship developer alongside whom to move forward with any kind of <i>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</i>competitor.</p>

<p>That has not, however, stopped FIFA from pursuing experiments in other areas, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-announces-4-world-cup-blockchain-games" rel="nofollow">unveiling of a range of Web3-related games</a> to coincide with the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Will the same thing happen for next year's tournament? We can only wait and see.</p>

            <p>Starbreeze have cancelled Project Baxter, the co-op live service Dungeons &amp; Dragons game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game-on-the-way-from-payday-devs">announced back in 2023</a>. Part of the development team have been transferred to other projects with Starbreeze, while the remainder get to "transition to new roles across the industry".</p>
<p>Starbreeze have told us little about Project Baxter over the years, beyond characterising it as an action-adventure that reflects their "lifetime commitment" to  Games-as-a-Service, and stating that it would support PC and console crossplay. They announced it with a couple of artworks - one depicting a close-cropped mage in a cape, the other some pointy roofs and pennants. The game surely would have built upon Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-payday-2">established</a>, albeit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-sales-significantly-lower-than-hoped-but-starbreeze-focused-on-long-term-success">recently eroded</a> reputation for co-op heisting. Now, however, Starbreeze bosses have decided that doubling down on Payday is the safer route forward.</p>
<p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," comments CEO Adolf Kristjansson in <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">a release to investors</a>. "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p>
<p>Around 44 people, spanning employees and contractors, are to lose their roles at Starbreeze in the course of writing off Baxter. The press release adds that "the discontinuation of Baxter, combined with an increased focus on the Payday franchise, will enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026." For context, cash-flow positive means you have more money coming in over a given period, than going out - it's not the same as being overall profitable. Starbreeze <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-have-switched-ceo-six-months-after-disastrous-launch">made a huge loss in their financial year 2024</a> after a catastrophic launch showing for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. </p><p>Kristjansson ends the release by thanking the Baxter team and D&amp;D license owners Wizards of the Coast, adding that work on Baxter "will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze". Maybe they should give the laid-off Baxter team members a Special Thanks credit in Payday 4, assuming that's next on the agenda. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

              <p>We’re closing in on Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s sales even taking place next week on October 7 and October 8. You can expect to see all sorts of deals covering a range of consumer tech, kitchen appliances, apparel, and more. Even though it’s not quite here yet, some deals have already started pouring in. Take a look over the the Fire HD 10. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">This Amazon tablet built for relaxation and fun normally is currently as much as 56% off.</a></p>
<p>There are four different versions of Amazon’s latest tablet. You can choose between having 32GB or 64GB of capacity as well as whether you want to put up with lock screen ads or not. If you don’t mind being bombarded with Alan Ritchson’s beefy shoulders and chiseled face promoting&nbsp;<em>Reacher&nbsp;</em>every time you reach for your tablet, you can get the Fire HD 10 for as low as $70. The 32GB is down to that from $140 while the 64GB is down to just $80 (originally $180). If&nbsp; you’d prefer not to have to look at ads on a device you own whenever you use it, you’re looking at a price point of $85 for the 32GB model and $95 for the 64GB model. If you end up going with the ad-enabled version but change your mind later, no worries. You can pay a one-time fee of $15 to have them removed after the fact.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Federal investigators and researchers at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) are brushing up on gaming. A reportedly leaked briefing document shows the agency born out of 9/11 to combat global terrorism is taking a closer look at what&nbsp; “violent extremist US teens” are doing in online gaming platforms ranging from <em>Fortnite</em> to Battle.net.</p> <p>Published by <a href="https://danboguslaw.substack.com/p/leaked-intel-brief-shows-feds-terrified">independent journalist Dan Boguslaw</a>, the alleged NCTC document lists a bunch of different places people play games and each one’s functionality. The full list includes Battle.net, Discord, <em>Fortnite</em>, PlayStation Network,<em> Roblox, </em>Steam, Twitch, and Xbox Live. Discord, which the gunman who allegedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">assassinated Charlie Kirk</a> used to discuss the murder, is the only platform that’s listed as checking every functionality box: “text chat,” “voice chat,” “video chat,” “image sharing,” “friend lists,” and “discoverable communities.”</p>

 <p>“Some violent extremist US teens probably play online games or use gaming-affiliated networks and applications (apps), and could use these apps to communicate with like-minded individuals, conduct plotting, or spread terrorist messaging, judging from a past report of extremist use of online gaming to enable terrorist activity,” the leaked memo reads.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems pretty clear the government is coming for Discord users <a href="https://t.co/SFc4yApeAU">pic.twitter.com/SFc4yApeAU</a></p> <p>— Ken Klippenstein (NSPM-7 Compliant) (@kenklippenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1973463700918116392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You’ll note that the document isn’t concerned only with the plotting of potential terrorist activities but also “terrorist messaging,” whatever that is. Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, gaming-affiliated platforms like Discord, Twitch, and Steam have been called <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">to testify before Congress</a>. President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">recently proclaimed</a> Antifa a terrorist organization and the Heritage Foundation right-wing think tank <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/heritage-foundation-uses-bogus-stat-to-push-a-trans-terrorism-classification/">called on the FBI</a> to officially label “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism,” or “TIVE,” as a domestic terrorism threat category.</p>

 <p>The reported NCTC memo is quick to point out in a footnote that “the mere presence of an individual on one or more online gaming platforms is not indicative of any nefarious activity,” and that “law enforcement action should not be taken solely on the basis of the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.” But it does say that communication on these platforms could be grounds for further investigation if authorities “observe suspicious behavior.”</p> <p>There are a few notable absences on the sheet. YouTube is not mentioned at all, despite a wealth of gaming content and an algorithmic engine for pointing users toward it like a fire hose. Nintendo Switch Online is also missing despite the fact that the Switch 2 just rolled out video sharing and GameChat. I guess the country’s terrorism experts don’t think anyone is plotting political violence inside <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

                <p>When it comes to building a winning team in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, the right formation is just as important as the players you pick. A good formation can unlock your team’s true potential, while the wrong one can leave you exposed at every turn. But whether you’re someone who favors the gegenpress over tiki-taka, there’s a formation for you.</p><p>This guide will explain the <strong>best FC 26 formations</strong>, breaking down their strengths and weaknesses, while explaining what type of players you’ll need to make it work. From tried and tested setups like 4-2-3-1 Wide to more experimental systems like 3-5-2, we’ll help you find the perfect shape to dominate in your next Division Rivals or Career Mode game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_1_2_1_2_Narrow">4-1-2-1-2 Narrow</h2><p dir="ltr">The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow meta is back, and we couldn’t be more delighted. This diamond formation wasn’t really favoured in the FC 25 meta, but it’s having a bit of a resurgence.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s designed for players who want to dominate possession in the middle of the pitch, using quick passing and deep runs to open up their opponent’s defensive line. Your CDM acts as an anchor to help control the play with two box-to-box central midfielders, while a creative CAM acts as a Shadow Striker.</p><p dir="ltr">Two strikers up front are able to play off one another or hold up the ball for midfield reinforcements. As the name suggests, the formation is tight, so if the ball is overturned, the CDM should be sitting in the passing lanes waiting for the right ball to intercept.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation really only works if you have good fullbacks and a talented CDM for cover. Since the shape is quite predictable, it can be easy for an attacking squad to carve the backline open because of the space left behind.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we set up our squad:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: AxZKwE4#K8S</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Counter</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Sweeper Keeper, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Box-to-Box, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Poacher, Attack / Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_2_3_1_Wide">4-2-3-1 Wide</h2><p dir="ltr">If you used 4-2-3-1 last year, this will feel rather familiar. With four defenders, two CDMs, and one CAM, this is arguably one of the most balanced formations you can use.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation offers you control in transitional play, while giving you lots of attacking options up front. The CAM - acting as a Shadow Striker -is the creative link between the lone striker and the wingers, who should cut inside to receive passes. In defense, two CDMs support the four-strong defensive line, helping to cover the passing lanes to break up play.</p><p dir="ltr">We’ve set this up so that the CDMs are involved in build up play, but we’d recommend having a striker who can adequately fulfil an Advanced Forward role. We’ve also locked our fullbacks into a defensive set up, but if you want to stretch the play more, you can switch them to a balanced view.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we’ve set it up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: GZewNW4MwiDo</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Ball-Playing Keeper, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender/Ball-Playing Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (L): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (R): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_4_2_Holding">4-4-2 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This is one of the most popular formations in the game - and one that’s perfect if you’re just starting out. This is because your defense, midfield, and attackers are all perfectly balanced on the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">With four players in defense and midfield, it offers a strong defensive structure while offering you options in attack with two strikers. The wide midfielders and fullbacks can stretch the attack on the counter to create chances.</p><p dir="ltr">This balanced spread makes it difficult for opponents to find gaps to attack. However, with only two central players in midfield, you can find yourself overrun when coming up against teams that overload the middle of the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">To help counter this, we’ve opted to use the Holding version of the formation to reinforce the defense in light of FC 26’s reduced AI defending gameplay. This gives us two CDMs, rather than two central midfielders.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are our tactics in full:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: SBs8ciEacQ%U</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_3_3_Holding">4-3-3 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This formation is one of the most versatile attacking formations in the game, giving you plenty of width, decent midfield control, and clear attacking options. With three forwards you can stretch pretty much any defense with quick passing through both wide options and central midfield.</p><p dir="ltr">4-3-3 formations work really well for players who like to counter quickly and directly using plenty of width. If you want to slow it down, your midfield options can dictate the tempo with the fullbacks dropping in to create more space. The only problem is that this shape can be overrun by the formations above. If your midfielders are caught out of possession high up the pitch, you may struggle to win the ball back.</p><p dir="ltr">To counter this, we’ve set up our squad so we have a holding CDM, flanked by a deep-lying playmaker and a playmaker in central midfield. Our wingers will provide width in attack, with one wingback available on support duties.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re going to opt for this formation, you’re going to need strong, fast wingers who have decent shooting and passing stats. You’re also going to need a talented striker who can finish consistently from anywhere in the box.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we’d set this up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: EBdk%umK%GAm</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">RB: Wingback, Support</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Holding, Ball-Winning</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build-Up / Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">LW: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Wide Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Why_are_these_the_best_FC_26_formations_">Why are these the best FC 26 formations?</h2><p dir="ltr">With 29 different formations available in the game, you might be wondering why we’ve selected just four above. The simple answer is that they best fit the current meta, where compact shapes and quick passing dominate. The AI defending changes this year mean you have to rely on tight shape, passing lanes, and quick transitions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the formations we’ve highlighted offer a strong defensive base, clear attacking patterns, and an adaptability that will help you gain the upper hand in competitive matches. The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow gives you central overloads and passing triangles, 4-2-3-1 Wide balances structure with creativity, 4-4-2 Holding gives you a balanced foundation to build from, and 4-3-3 stretches defense with pace and width.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the best FC 26 formations will change with future updates, but for now these are the tactics we’d use to gain the upper hand in Division Rivals, Ultimate Team, and Career Mode.</p>

As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Naoki Hamaguchi told Game Developer, adding the new interpretation of the story was deliberate to maintain player interest over time, considering that this remake treatment of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is split into three parts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to keep the players' interest in our game, but in order to do that, we can't simply just add new elements, that won't be enough," Hamaguchi said during an interview at Tokyo Game Show. "We wanted to add a new interpretation to the story, entirely new story elements, things like that to, again, sustain the player interest and have players look forward and be curious to the conclusion of the remake trilogy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When working on a remake, Hamaguchi said he first tries to think what the original players have in mind. In this case, what they loved about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There are parts he didn't want to alter or change and decided to keep as is, but there were others that the team wanted to create something new for the modern generation of players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, there are clear expectations in mind, which the team took into consideration to preserve that interest. For context, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched in April 2020, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> following in 2024.

Rather, it was about ensuring success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The key for this project to succeed is to determine what kind of changes we would want to bring in order to sustain the player interest throughout the remake trilogy," he said.

<figure data-uuid="45e366b1f66d0"><a title="Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45e366b1f66d0/super-mario-bros-2-the-lost-levels.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've <em>all</em> heard of Minus World, right? A glitched world in the original 1985 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, it was accessible via World 1-2 and is an infinitely-looping underwater level, similarly designed to World 7-2. It's one of the most legendary glitches in gaming history.</p>
<p>And, it turns out, its direct sequel <em>also</em> has its own Minus World. It's just taken almost 40 years to discover it, and speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA">Kosmic</a> is the one who discovered it (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels-minus-world-levels-found-four-decades-later/">Nintendo Everything</a>!).</p>
<p>In both the Japanese and English releases <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_the_lost_levels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a> (the actual Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan, available officially in the West via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_all-stars">All-Stars</a> bundle on the SNES), various glitched worlds are available, either changing the names, looping screens, or changing enemy behaviour.</p>
<p>However, it's that All-Stars collection where a Minus World is really tucked away, and it's incredibly complex to pull off. You have to first progress through some increasingly-glitched versions of levels; the idea is Kosmic is trying to get past B-8, but reaching B-7 the first time, he realised it was impossible to beat.</p>
<p>Saving, quitting, and reloading brought him back to a completely different level layout, but it allowed him to get past those impassable glitches and roadblocks. A glitched warp pipe (with part of a coin above it) in B-9 brought Kosmic back to World 1-1, but this didn't deter him.</p>

<p>Continuing to progress through glitched worlds until he reaches World B-D and, eventually, various glitched menu options. It's a lot easier to watch than read us explain it, so make sure you watch Kosmic's new video above to see just how <em>wild</em> some of these glitches get.</p>
<p>So, why did this take so long? Kosmic mentions that difficulty is probably the main reason, but he also believes that, because this glitch requires you to make much more progress in-game, and wasn't played by as many people, there's just lower interest in general.</p>
<p>Well, we're glad that someone was willing to dig deep into the glitch worlds of The Lost Levels, and it's a pretty amazing discovery after nearly 40 years.</p>

<p>As is the case with many of these Generative AI tools, Sora 2 has been trained on millions of hours of human-made footage which already exists online, almost always without permission – and that includes copyrighted material created by the likes of Sega, Nintendo and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Sora 2 has only been available for a day or so, and most social network feeds are already flooded with videos generated using the tool, many of which blatantly steal intellectual property, including Nintendo's.</p>
<p>This fact hasn't been lost on the many people on social media.</p>




<p>It's not just Nintendo's IP which is being infringed here; <strong>Sonic</strong> appears in many Sora 2-generated videos, too.</p>

<p>OpenAI has previously stated that it has adopted an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-new-sora-video-generator-require-copyright-holders-opt-out-wsj-reports-2025-09-29/">'opt-out' policy regarding IP</a> – that means IP owners need to contact OpenAI to have their IP removed from the Sora 2 training database. Critics argue that it's basically the equivalent of robbing a bank and only returning the money when you're told it's not yours.</p>

<p>It's not just the world of video games which is being replicated here without permission; anime and movies are also being reproduced, thanks to the fact that advanced video models like this are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright">betraying their training data with more accuracy</a> than ever before.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the notoriously litigious Nintendo will take this lying down, but many AI sceptics are predicting legal action from multiple IP owners in response to Sora 2's flood of cloned material. Last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-is-reportedly-targeting-ai-generated-mario-pictures">takedowns were filed</a> against AI-generated images featuring Mario and other Nintendo characters.</p>
<p>Generative AI is a hot topic in the world of video games these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">with a recent report claiming that over half of Japanese developers are using AI in some form</a>. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">maintained</a> that it won't be making use of the controversial technology, at least for the time being.</p>

<p>As reported by the folks at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance will legally represent only a portion of the studio's overall workforce, since it only applies to the UK arm of a company that also has offices in Portugal and Finland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, marketing manager Poppy Ingham says the union was set up in order to give employees "a seat at the table in the big management meetings". She says ZA/UM workers "like being here" and "want to continue being here", and she wants the studio to be "a collaborative project between the workers and management".</p>

<p>According to Ingham, ZA/UM management has agreed to negotiate and consult with Workers' Alliance on issues that "ensure the general safety and care of employees", including pay rates, holiday time, and working hours.</p>

<p>The formation of the union at ZA/UM follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellation of a project at the studio</a> back in early 2024, which was itself accompanied by a round of layoffs. Ingham says it's these layoffs, "unfortunate" though they were, that "spurred [the remaining workers] on" to create Workers' Alliance.</p>

<p>ZA/UM has been racked with controversy since key figures Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">departed the studio</a> in 2022, with both claiming their departures were a result of being forced out by unscrupulous investors.</p>




<p>Since then, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">number</a> of key&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">personnel</a> have announced their own spiritual successors to the critically-acclaimed RPG.</p>

<p>Additionally, ZA/UM itself has also unveiled&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>(which was probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">formerly known as <em>Project C4</em></a>), a game that looks very much to be in the same realm as&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

            <p>Fortnite developers Epic Games have confirmed they'll be redeploying the 'Peaceful Hips' emote added to the battle royale as part of a crossover with superhero show Peacemaker, but with some modifications. This follows the dance being pulled from the game earlier this week, due to Epic's concerns about "creative intentions" in the aftermath of a big plot twist in the TV show.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is your spoiler warning if you don't want to know about <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/peacemaker-twist-earth-x-prejudice">the Peacemaker twist in question</a>. Right, so one of the show's recent episodes sees protagonist Chris Smith, that's Peacemaker, discover that an alternate dimension he's been visiting is actually Earth-X, a version of Earth that exists in an alternate timeline which saw the Nazis win World War 2. Thus, America's a fascist state, right down to the flag having a big swastika on it. Cue a controversy, as some poses in the dance of Fortnite's 'Peaceful Hips' emote could suddenly be viewed as potentially resembling the shape of a swastika.</p>
<p>So, Epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842">opted to disable the emote</a> while they talked to Warner Bros. in order to investigate the "creative intentions" of the emote. The result was Warner Bros saying they didn't intend the dance to have any Nazi connotations.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline.

<p>"We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline," a fresh tweet from Epic reads. "To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket."</p><p>It seems bizarre, given that the collaboration is so recent, that Epic wouldn't have been given some kind of heads-up about this potentially controversial twist in Peacemaker's latest season. While Warner Bros might not have anticipated that the twist would lead to such an issue for the game publisher, it's a definite failure in communication. We'll see if the situation leads to any changes in how Epic handles collaborations down the road.</p>

              <p>Technically, you can use your standard office monitor for gaming, but is it the same as a dedicated screen that’s built to chase enemies with exceptional refresh rates and near-instant response time? Not really.</p>
<p>You need gear that keeps up, and right now, you can upgrade without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">Amazon has dropped the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) to just $110, which is a massive 45% off.</a> You’re saving $90 on a display that’s going to make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action, but the discount ends soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mind-Boggling Refresh Rate, Stunning Screen</h2>
<p>Lags and blurs are frustrating. You can’t just sit and wait for your screen to catch up while your opponent gets away. Odyssey G3 packs an impressive 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time for ultra-fast visuals that give an in-game advantage. Jumping on an enemy squad the moment you spot them, or slipping away from a close fight, becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Bid farewell to image tearing and mid-action interruptions, too, because AMD Radeon FreeSync makes sure your monitor and graphics card stay in sync – always in real time. There’s Black Equalizer to brighten dark areas in the game, and Virtual Aim Point to line up shots more precisely. Basically, whether you’re checking dark corners for bad guys or going for the clutch shot, this monitor keeps up. Even better, blue light is actively minimized to keep your eyes comfortable, and reduced screen flicker makes it easier to fight the demons for longer.</p>



<p>As for the screen itself, you’re getting a decent 24-inch FHD display that pushes stunning, vibrant visuals. The 3-sided borderless design offers maximum space to play, and will also come in handy when you run a dual-monitor setup. The monitor’s height can be fully adjusted, and you can tilt, swivel, or pivot it to match your ideal setup. Port-wise, you’ll find a Power port, Headphone IN, HDMI IN, and a DisplayPort IN around the back.</p>
<p>If you’ve been playing on your standard monitor or laptop and want to upgrade to something more powerful, the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) is an excellent option to consider. It gets you an exceptional display with an even better refresh rate and response time, which are sure to take your gaming experience up a notch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The monitor usually retails for $200, but this deal brings it down to $110, which is a much more affordable price point.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze has canceled Project Baxter, its co-op Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, laid off a significant portion of its development team, and announced plans to double down on its Payday franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-announces-dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game">Project Baxter was announced in December 2023</a> as an Unreal Engine 5 D&amp;D game that would “carry the signature Starbreeze cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, community engagement and a larger than life experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan then was to launch Project Baxter on all major platforms in 2026 with crossplay. But news has been scarce, with a social media post showing off a single in-engine image in September 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-players-react-to-developer-starbreeze-saying-it-will-make-a-significantly-lower-level-of-investment-in-year-2-content">Starbreeze said it was still hiring for Project Baxter</a>, with work on the game continuing “at full speed.” “Internally, we have weekly playtests of Baxter, and active discussions with a number of industry-leading players regarding potential collaborations around Baxter's development and launch,” the studio said at the time. As of November 2024, Starbreeze had 191 total employees, most of which were based at its head office in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision to cancel Project Baxter has cost the Swedish company SEK 255 million (approx. $27.2 million) in a write-down of development costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CEO Adolf Kristjansson called it a “difficult but necessary decision,” but failed to mention any particular issues with the development of Project Baxter that might have factored in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential,” Kristjansson said in a prepared statement. “By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Part” of the Baxter team will be redeployed across Starbreeze’s projects, mostly within Payday, but around 44 full-time employees across staff and contractors will lose their jobs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are doubling down on what our players love – and what we do best – owning the heisting genre,” Kristjansson continued. “Payday is more than a game — it’s a genre we created and continue to lead. By redeploying talent and capital, we can bring innovation to heisting gameplay faster, while also laying the foundation for the future expansion of the genre.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze said Payday has had more than 50 million players worldwide and generated close to SEK 4 billion (approx. $427 million) in lifetime gross revenue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With increased focus and resources, Starbreeze will accelerate its roadmap, delivering more frequent updates, new content drops, and continuous live-engagement,” the company said. “The discontinuation of Baxter, combined with an increased focus on the Payday franchise, will enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kristjansson added: “I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on Payday we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does the future hold for Starbreeze? The 12-year-old Payday 2 still has significantly more players than Payday 3 on Steam, but the developer insisted Payday 3 “is being developed into a scalable live-engagement platform to engage millions of players worldwide.” The Payday 3 team will grow to about 50 employees before the end of the year “and continue to grow in line with increased player engagement.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Starbreeze said it has new heist games in the works, too, including spinoffs and narrative-driven projects, and plans to expand Payday into new platforms. Meanwhile, it’s offering its services as a work-for-hire studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Starbreeze has canceled its upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, which was in the works under the working title Project Baxter. The developer said its board of directors and management opted to cancel the project after a "strategic review" found that resources would be better deployed on its successful Payday franchise instead.</p><p>Starbreeze is taking an impairment charge of about SEK 255 million ($27.2 million) as a result of Project Baxter's cancellation.</p><p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," Starbreeze CEO Adolf Kristjansson said. "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p><h2><strong>Layoffs</strong></h2><p>Some developers who were working on Project Baxter are now shifting to other teams at Starbreeze, including the Payday unit. Others are being let go. "Where internal opportunities are limited, Starbreeze will provide active support for affected employees to transition to new roles across the industry," the company said, adding that about 44 developers, including full-time employees and contractors, are losing their jobs as part of this move.</p><p>Kristjansson went on to say that Starbreeze is "doubling down" on the heisting genre, including Payday and "the future expansion of the genre."</p><p>The cancellation of Project Baxter, layoffs, and further focus on Payday and the heist genre overall, will help Starbreeze become "cash-flow positive in 2026," the company said.</p><p>"I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support," Kristjansson said. "Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on Payday we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed."</p><h2><strong>What's next for Starbreeze</strong></h2><p>Starbreeze also outlined some of what's to come in the future, including the aforementioned doubling down on Payday. The latest entry in the series, Payday 3, is nowhere near as successful as Payday 2, at least on Steam and in terms of concurrent players. However, Starbreeze said today that it continues to deploy updates and improvements to Payday 3 to help t become a "scalable live-engagement platform to engage millions of players worldwide."</p><p>"The franchise will evolve into a modern live-engagement game through ongoing technology upgrades, expansion and refinement of the player experience, and enhanced engagement models designed to be both fair and sustainable," Starbreeze said.</p><p>For Payday 3, Starbreeze said the team working on the game will grow to about 50 people before the end of 2025 and will scale from there in line with player engagement, if it comes.</p><p>Payday 2 continues to get new updates and improvements as well, and the game recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-launches-a-subscription-service-that-gets-you-lots-of-dlc-for-5-month/1100-6534993/" data-ref-id="1100-6534993">added a subscription offering to get all the DLC for a monthly charge. </a></p><h2><strong>"New games and experiences" are coming</strong></h2><p>Starbreeze said the Payday franchise has reached more than 50 million people to date and has generated almost SEK 4 billion ($427.3 million) in lifetime gross revenue.</p><p>Given the immense success of Payday, Starbreeze said today that it is working on "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre beyond Starbreeze's core projects." These will include spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and "franchise expansion" to new platforms. Finally, Starbreeze said in its memo to investors that Starbreeze will continue to take on work-for-hire jobs to help supplement the company's revenue.</p><p>"This strategy is about execution and growth--with greater quality and predictability," Kristjansso said. "Our goal is to keep Payday evolving as a modern live-engagement game, and to open new ways for players to experience the heisting genre through heisting experiences and special operations. By focusing on delivering lasting value to players, we strengthen the foundation that drives sustainable growth for Starbreeze."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Discounty is a cosy Supermarket simulator in the vein of Stardew Valley. You’ll be ordering products, stocking shelves, and then selling them to the various townsfolk of Blomkest in an effort to expand your business. Unfortunately along with that comes dealing with inattentive local government, shady local businesses, and backstabbing journalists as it seems something in this town is rotten. And all you wanted to do was run a supermarket.</p>
<p><iframe title="Discounty | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbNGAedv08M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You arrive in the town of Blomkest to take over and reinvigorate your Aunt’s business, the local Discounty supermarket, where “everything’s always on sale!” As you wander through the town, you stroll past the bank, town hall, a bar, all the usual places you might expect, but there’s also abandoned buildings dotted around and a memorial museum that is no longer maintained since the council cut funding. Then you’re shown to the trailer where you live for the whole game – no house upgrades here – and told to ignore the mysterious shed behind it that emanates strange noises.</p>


<p>As you get stuck into managing the supermarket, you’ll be ordering stuff, putting it on display, and then manning the cash registers. You don’t set the prices yourself, instead hammering them into a calculator based on the price in your big book of products. It’s pretty enjoyable at first. There’s a zen-like calmness to it when you don’t have too many customers, but when you do, you to have to rush around refilling shelves whilst also serving them and cleaning the floor, which is hectic and results in frustrated customers. I quickly decided to have multiple shelves with the same item at a time so I didn’t have to rush around so much. With a bit of mental maths, you can speed up manning the till as well, saving yourself from the angry faces from impatient customers.</p>


<p>But there’s a litany of things that get in the way of this. Most products are bought form a computer and then quickly delivered by a guy called Guy, which is perfect. You do also need to arrange trade deals with local businesses for access to their products, though, which means running around town every time you want to restock their products, upgrade the trade deal, or ask them something. Stocking your shelves limits you to grabbing things from the store room in groups of five. Only need to display two toilet rolls? For some reason have to pick up five and put three back, adding unnecessary time and fiddliness.</p>
<p>As customers shuffle around once you open at 9AM, they leave scuff marks on the floor, but you can only clean two scuffs at a time with soap before needing to take the bucket back. Then one of the customers who got everything they were shopping for and, if anything, you managed to serve quicker than the others leaves with an angry face for no discernible reason – nothing you can do about that. At the end of the day, 5PM, you close the shop and sit through the unskippable summary of sales, which is doubly redundant as you need to manually keep track of stock, and because you served everyone yourself. The only information I really need on this page is how much money I made and it doesn’t need to be listed per product, one at a time, whilst I wait for it to finish.</p>

<p>The shop doesn’t open on Sunday, so you might as well skip the day and get through to Monday, where you’ll have to replace all the posters around town, because they’re removed every weekend for no good reason. Oh, but you’ve probably forgotten to print them and the only printer in town, which is in the town hall, takes eight in-game hours to print a single one.</p>
<p>I quickly lost my enjoyment of Discounty because of all these elements. Management games can be cosy, but not when constantly putting frustrations in my path. I was enjoying completing small challenges to unlock more products, add more pockets to my outfit, get an improved scanner, and the actual act of selling was fun, but restocking while serving customers is&nbsp;next to impossible when there’s a lot of customers without angering them all. Every time one of the issues above shows itself again – which is pretty much every day for some of them – my enjoyment diminishes.</p>
<p>The overarching storyline seemed like it might be a plus at first as well, but something isn’t quite right. Sometimes plot threads are just left unresolved. You start out in a trailer and that seems like a signal for “you’ll be able to upgrade to a house at some point,” and the abandoned house you find shortly afterwards reinforces this, but in the end it just doesn’t happen. Then there’s the townsfolk, who are the most infuriating and obnoxious group of NPCs I’ve ever encountered. Everyone is gossiping, myself included, but one character admonished me for apparently starting a conversation with gossip about her own son – all I did was press to interact! Elmer in the town hall has be constantly hounded to do things he’s supposed to, such as removing a tree that is cutting off the only access to nearby farms, or fixing a broken staircase.</p>

<p>All of this involves sprinting across Blomkest on top of your other outings to restock your trade deal products that only restock on specific days. It’s infuriating. I just wanted to run a supermarket, not deal with red tape, incompetent government officials, unpleasant people, and getting loans. Even your Aunt in the game says “I didn’t catch you slacking, did I?” as she enters the store you moved into town to revitalise for her. Everyone just seems so unpleasant, and the “small town drama” promised by the game’s marketing just means whe the worst person you know would describe as “spilling tea”, as they spread rumours and bad mouth people behind their backs.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, I’ve been playing on a Switch, and my experience hasn’t been great. There’s no crashing or anything, but anytime you’re outside of a small building the frame rate tanks noticeably. It’s a very nice looking game as far as pixel art goes, with plenty of nice looking visual effects depending on what time of day it is, but the frame rate is consistently terrible when outside. There’s also some small oversights in behaviours, such as once when a staircase was blocked off for way longer than it was supposed to, but I saw Barbara, my fishy sticks supplier and uses the stairs in her commute, walk straight through it without so much as a pause.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159338/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has spent the past few decades going from strength to strength with Mario Kart, so it’s not hard to see why companies holding other recognisable IP have wanted to take a crack at the kart-racer formula to see if they can pull a following of their own. While plenty of copycats have popped up over the years, one that’s made the most sense has been the Sonic franchise, as high-octane speed is kind of the titular character’s whole appeal.</p>
<p>Sonic hasn’t always had the most enjoyable outings in the racing world, but he’s also had some that have gotten awfully close to matching Nintendo’s golden goose. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is one such entry, combining thrilling action and controls with an interesting multiverse gimmick to make for a worthwhile and enjoyable experience. It’s just a shame that the base Switch really struggles to run it well.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159325/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is roughly par for the course with what you’d expect for a kart racer, as you drift, boost, and trick your way to victory across a series of three-lap, four-race cups that incorporate mind-bending courses and locales.</p>
<p>Effectively drifting corners, timing your boosts, and seizing on shortcuts are all part of a hard-fought victory, while occasional item drops add an X factor that can both give you the edge you need to win first place or torpedo a lead that you’d been holding onto. Overall, the items feel well balanced, and they help to keep things interesting as their influence constantly changes up the formation of a race.</p>
<p>Tracks primarily consist of a mixture of original courses and reimagined versions of classic Sonic courses from across the main series, such as Radical Highway from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2</a> or Water Palace from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/sonic_rush">Sonic Rush</a>. Overall, course design is extremely strong, with multiple routes adding to the replayability and strategy, while the constant jumping between land, sea, and air portions keeps things feeling fresh and fast-paced. Everyone will naturally have their favourites, but it’s tough to argue against the overall quality of these tracks. There’s really not a bad one in the bunch.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159324/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most importantly, the central ‘Crossworlds’ gimmick makes the courses feel dynamic in a way that most other kart racers struggle to replicate. Upon nearing the end of the first lap, the competitor currently in the lead will be given a choice between two <em>alternative</em> courses you will then traverse for the duration of lap two. So, you can begin a race in Seaside Hill, then jump to Mystic Jungle for a lap before returning to Seaside Hill to finish things up. Given that any stage can appear at the end of lap one, each contest feels fresh and exciting given that consecutive races starting on the same course can have radically different routes to the finish line.</p>
<p>If you want to mix things up beyond the base Grand Prix mode, there’s also a Race Park mode. Here, you participate in a variety of side challenges that task you with alternative goals beyond simply being the first to cross the finish line. One such challenge is a team-based mode in which you’re given points for how many times you can tap a teammate with your vehicle throughout the race, while another is centred on hitting as many foes with weapons as possible. Though Race Park doesn’t radically shift away from the core concept of racing, it helps to mix up the gameplay a bit and gives you some nice extrinsic rewards for doing so, such as new part unlocks.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159330/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Though there’s plenty of strategy that goes into charting a racing line and knowing when to time boosts and item drops, much of a victory can hinge on decisions made before you even get on the track. There’s an extensive selection of parts you can swap out with any given kart that affect stats like acceleration and weight that help give you the edge in a race, depending on your chosen loadout.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the Gadget system gives you a variety of passive power-ups that can stack the deck in your favour, such as increasing the frequency of specific items or reducing the time it takes for mid-air trick animations to play out. I really appreciated the customisability here, as it not only allows you to tailor loadouts to specific playstyles, but consistently rewards you and reinforces continued play.</p>
<p>Naturally, a big part of the experience here is found in playing the online multiplayer, and I’m happy to report that it‘s just as crazy and thrilling as couch multiplayer, even if it’s a bit different not having someone next to you to talk smack with.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159326/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In my experience, there were no dropped connections or notable slowdowns, and lobbies were (obviously) full in seconds. To add a bit more to chase beyond the raw fun of a race with real people, there’s also a progressive ranking system that awards points based on your race performance.</p>
<p>Visually, this racer is a little bit of a mixed bag, combining high spectacle and brilliant effects with overall low performance that notably hampers the moment-to-moment gameplay. On one hand, the courses themselves are absolutely gorgeous, and the constant twists in the track design and explosions from various items being fired make the screen a veritable feast of energy and verve. On the other, the base Switch hardware just isn’t up to the task of running this all very well.</p>
<p>At <em>best</em>, this game is running at 30fps, which is already feels barely passable for a high-intensity racer like this. But the rapid-fire action frequently sends the frame rate into the low 20s to high teens. Add just one other player for splitscreen action, and the frame rates sink even lower. Performance feels roughly the same between docked and handheld modes. Combine this with the generally low and grainy resolution (especially when viewed on a Switch 2 screen in handheld mode), and this is comfortably the <em>worst</em> way to play this otherwise enjoyable game.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159333/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s far from an unplayable mess, but take one look at footage of how this looks and plays on stronger hardware, and — however predictable it is — it’s tough not to feel like the Switch port is a notably inferior product.</p>
<p>And whether this Switch 1 version is improved when running on Switch 2 is a bit of a toss-up. On the base Switch, you trade S2's faster loading times and somewhat better frame rate for a better visual experience, with the game's low resolution being less noticeable on the 720p handheld screen.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is a genuinely excellent game, but the Switch version is just 'alright'. The dynamic track designs, high replayability, and thrilling visuals all combine to make for a game that — judged purely on that content — stands as a strong competitor to the dominant Mario Kart series.</p>
<p>But the poor visual quality and resolution present in the Switch version drag down the overall experience and make it feel like a much more mediocre experience. I'd still give this port a light recommendation; it’s a fair choice if Switch is the <em>only</em> platform available to you, and ultimately justifies the price of admission. Otherwise, I’d suggest waiting to see how the upcoming Switch 2 version pans out, or picking it up now on another platform.</p></section>

			<p>A Kingdom Come Deliverance remaster or upgraded version is rumored to be in the works for an early 2026 release, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bertik11/">bertik11</a>, who shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1nuoprk/warhorse_studio_upcoming_upgrade_and_fantasy_game/">Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a> that the first entry in the series by Warhorse Studios will get an upgrade early next year, between January and April. The user added that the studio is not working on a new Lord of the Rings game as rumored, but is still working on their own fantasy game.</p>



<p>While a rumor coming from an unspecified source should be taken with a massive grain of salt, bertik11 proved reliable regarding Kingdom Come Deliverance series rumors. Last year, the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1erxl3d/kingdom_come_deliverance_2_is_coming_in_2025/">revealed that Kingdom Come Deliverance II would be delayed to 2025</a> before the official announcement was made and that the game's Gamescom booth would have a medieval village design, which turned out to be the case, so there's a good chance they indeed have access to insider information.</p>



<p>Although Kingdom Come Deliverance was a solid role-playing game when it launched back in 2018, a remaster would improve the experience considerably if it addressed some of its most critical issues. Quality-of-life improvements, in particular, would make it a much more accessible game, improving its steep learning curve and interface to make it easier for those who only played its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">excellent sequel</a> to get into the game and experience the beginning of Henry of Skalitz's story for themselves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has canceled&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, its in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, and a number of employees are being laid off across the studio as well.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">first announced back in December 2023</a>, has been shut down so that the studio can deploy its resources to "accelerate the growth" of its "flagship&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise".</p>

<p>The cancellation will cost Starbreeze around SEK 255 million (roughly $27.2 million) in "non-cash impairment" form, and it'll also result in the laying off of around 44 employees. Both decisions will, according to Starbreeze, allow the studio to become "cash-flow positive" next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=_fFjrSfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=1g5K_QqN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze's live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>&nbsp;game&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>&nbsp;is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>It's all part of a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">corporate refocusing</a> on Starbreeze's part, with the studio looking to leverage its&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise and "the heisting genre" as a whole much more in the future.</p>

<p>According to Starbreeze, the new strategy will revolve around "deepening player engagement, broadening platform reach, and diversifying revenue streams", and it'll include expanding&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>"across platforms and experiences".</p>

<p>As part of this new strategy, Starbreeze says it will create "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre" beyond the studio's "core projects". These will include "spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and franchise expansion to new platforms".</p>

<p>Another pillar of the developer's new strategy is work-for-hire operations, through which Starbreeze will complete work on projects for other publishers and studios. That work could well cross over with&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>in future, as well, such as in the case of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, however, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that the price increase was unrelated to the introduction of the subscription model, although commercial exec Gustav Nisser admitted the studio "dropped the ball" with regards to the subscription's rollout.</p>

<p>The shift to a focus on<i>&nbsp;Payday&nbsp;</i>also follows a pretty dismal couple of years for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, the latest game in the series, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">plummeting sales</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departing executives</a>&nbsp;not exactly contributing to an optimistic overall outlook for the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn recently released native Steam Deck build delivers significant performance improvements over the original Proton Windows build, according to a new comparison video.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a>, the new build of the survival-horror game developed by Bloober Team runs much better than the original Proton Windows build in nearly every comparison.</p>



<p>While hitting a steady 60 FPS is something the Steam Deck obviously can't do, even with a native build, the performance improvement it brings makes the game often run above 30 FPS, even in demanding areas like the Apartment Complex, where the system struggles to even hit 30 FPS with the Proton Windows build.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cronos The New Dawn: NEW Steam Deck Native Build Performance Vs Proton Windows Version" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2k1FFgbBofc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While any game benefits greatly from a 60 frames per second framerate and higher, with its slower-paced survival-horror experience, Cronos: The New Dawn is more than enjoyable even at 30 FPS, as it relies mostly on atmosphere to deliver one of the finest games released by Bloober Team. You can learn more about it by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">checking out my review.</a></p>



<p>The release of native Steam Deck builds is a relatively recent happening, but one that is extremely welcome to extend the life of the system which essentially started the PC handheld craze of the past couple of years. <span>Besides the Cronos: The New Dawn build, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">B</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">aldur's Gate 3 native Steam Deck build is also now available for download</a>, introducing performance improvements in the city of Baldur's Gate in Act 3, one of the most demanding areas in the game.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Pocketpair's announcement that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would launch version 1.0 of Palworld in 2026</a>, industry veteran Yoshiki Okamoto, who has worked for a long time as a designer at CAPCOM on series like Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Mega Man, Dino Crisis, and more, shared his opinion on the situation with Nintendo's Pokémon in a video message <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIhdKKNRnI0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on his personal YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p><em>I personally believe Palworld crossed a line that should not be crossed, and I don't want the world to become a place where this kind of thing is acceptable. I don't want it to be like, it's okay because it sold well, or because it was fun, or because it has good reviews. If a settlement is reached with Nintendo, then I think Palworld will become a game that is officially fine to play. However, it is currently a game that's being sued, so it’s unacceptable. By playing the game, you are supporting it, so please do not buy it.</em></p>



<p>However, Okamoto's opinion was met with a mixed reception. Several fans pointed out that some of the games he worked on also featured very similar elements to games that were released before. </p>



<p>As a reminder, Nintendo notoriously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the developer in September 2024</a>, alleging infringement of patent rights, and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-says-game-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued in court</a> that game mods do not count as 'prior art'. The ongoing lawsuit forced Pocketpair to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make some changes to the game</a>, such as removing the ability to summon Pals with spheres, earlier this year.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Pocketpair announced a farming sim spin-off (<a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld: Palfarm</a>) just eleven days after Nintendo unveiled its own cozy farming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, currently in development at Koei Tecmo for a planned 2026 release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>Starbreeze has cancelled its Dungeons and Dragons project to focus on its flagship Payday franchise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">Codenamed Project Baxter</a>, it was revealed back in 2023 and was aiming for a 2026 release. Few details were available, but it was planned to have "the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, community engagement and a larger than life experience".</p>
<p>However, following a "strategic review", development has been discontinued as the board of directors and management have "concluded that resources are best deployed to accelerate the growth of" the Payday series.</p>

<p>As a result, the studio will incur a non-cash impairment of around SEK 255m (around £20m).</p>
<p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," said Adolf Kristjansson, CEO of Starbreeze, in a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p><p>The studio stated "part of the Baxter team will be redeployed across Starbreeze's projects, most prominently within Payday" and where "internal opportunities are limited, Starbreeze will provide active support for affected employees to transition to new roles across the industry". It estimates there will be a reduction in headcount of around 44 full-time employees and contractors.</p>
<p>Starbreeze boasted the Payday games have engaged over 50 million players globally, generating almost SEK 4bn in lifetime gross revenue.</p>
<p>"We are doubling down on what our players love - and what we do best - owning the heisting genre," said Kristjansson. "Payday is more than a game - it's a genre we created and continue to lead. By redeploying talent and capital, we can bring innovation to heisting gameplay faster, while also laying the foundation for the future expansion of the genre."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-acquires-publishing-rights-to-troubled-payday-3-says-move-will-accelerate-development-roadmap">Starbreeze acquired the publishing rights to its Payday 3 game</a> from Plaion, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">launched disastrously</a> in 2023. The acquisition would enable the studio to "significantly accelerate [its] content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole," said board member Thomas Lindgren at the time.</p>
