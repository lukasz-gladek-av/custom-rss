            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout London</a> launched late last month, but the huge, long in-development mod is so buggy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">Nic had to abandon his attempts to play it</a>. Its developers have already promised hotfixes, and now say a "huge" update is also on the way.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix," says <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1270453027953705024">the message shasred on the Team FOLON Discord server</a>. "This hotfix will address some crashes and include essential systems like 'Buffout 4,' which will be merged into the mod itself. We’ve also identified several other fixes that will provide immediate help. Additionally, we’ll be explaining certain features we added that might not have been as useful as we thought, so stay tuned for those details."
</p>
<p>"The future is bright! We’re already working on a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord floaty-patrol channel, as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems.
</p>
<p>"So, the plan is: hotfix first to stop and help with the crashes, then a big patch after."
</p>
<p>The devleopers also say they'll be doing a developer playthrough stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/teamfolon">their Twitch channel</a> on Thursday, August 8th, at 8pm BST (2pm CST), where they'll offer "behind-the-scenes info" on the development of the mod. If you're looking for help with bugs, they're also continuing to offer "1-on-1 troubleshooting" for players via Discord.
</p>
<p>Nic enjoyed the little of Fallout London he played, but was stymied by it sending him straight to desktop repeatedly over the course of a few hours. Hopefully those patches fix it up soon and we send him back in search of Big Dave.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There seems to be a wave of retro racers around recently, and each one seems to pick a particular target to shoot with its nostalgia gun, whether Wipeout or Lotus or Micro Machines or whatever else. 
</p>
<p>Maybe I'm forgetting some classic arcade racer, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victory-heat-rally">Victory Heat Rally</a> feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It's a 2.5D, "neo super scaler" arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

<p>As the trailer below notes, it now has a release window of this winter.

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594060/Victory_Heat_Rally/">Steam page</a> uses cliché phrases like "crank up", "banging beats" and "high octane energy", but screw it, I think it's justified. The trailer looks electric.
</p>
<p>You can play alone or with up to three friends, with championship, arcade and time trial modes. Players also select one of 12 drivers to play as, although I'm unsure whether there's any meaningful difference between the characters or if it's all just style. You can tune the cars to alter how they feel to drive, however, as well as customising how they look.
</p>
<p>"Super scaler" was a technology in Sega arcade games such as OutRun that could scale and rotate 3D sprites to create the illusion of 3D. The SNES equivalent, called Mode 7 and used in F-Zero among others, is perhaps better known.
</p>
<p>If you don't want to wait until the winter, SPGP Super Polygon Grand Prix released on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2459860/SPGP_Super_Polygon_Grand_Prix/">earlier this week</a>. It's in Early Access, and a lot less polished than Victory Heat Rally seems, </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games is dealing with an unforeseen technical malfunction that’s wiping the accounts of hundreds of thousands of players worldwide. On social platforms everywhere, players are expressing their dismay at this devastating issue that has caused some to have their accounts reset mid-raid. It has been stressed that this isn’t part of a pre-wipe event <strong>nor </strong>is it the arrival of the wipe itself, but it’s an unexpected bug that Battlestate might not recover from.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-well-that-s-awkward">Well, That’s Awkward</h2>



<p>Presently, players are finding it impossible to even boot Escape from Tarkov through Battlestate Games’ launcher. Those who were in the game were kicked out, and thousands are reporting their profiles being wiped. It’s unclear at the moment if <strong>every Tarkov player </strong>has been impacted by this issue.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear if this issue has impacted both PvE and PvP platforms, but it’s widely expected that it’s game-wide, which means both ecosystems will have been hit by this issue. That’s a <strong>monumental </strong>blow to PvE players, as one of the biggest selling points of that mode – which is stuck behind a paywall – was that you’d never <strong>need </strong>to undergo a regular wipe. Now, this latest malfunction means that you’ve been forced into one after what might be weeks of play.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As a result of a technical malfunction there was a loss of part of the game profiles data. It is not possible to restore profiles in a short period of time.</p><p>All players whose profiles have been affected will receive proportional in-game compensation in a short period of time.…</p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1821255670579990528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>At this point in the game’s lifecycle, many players are sitting at a high level with tens of millions of roubles in their pockets and countless kits in their stash. They’ll have acquired dozens of keys, keycards, and special items, and they’ll have completed stacks of quests. It was expected that Tarkov would wipe in the coming weeks, but this being a mistake on Battlestate Games’ part just puts a sour taste in the mouths of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Most players are now just urging Battlestate to hit the wipe button and move on with the planned update. As it stands, the game will revert to normal and then it’ll wipe <strong>again </strong>in a couple of weeks. For some players, this malfunction has wiped their all-time stats, including some that have played Escape from Tarkov for several years.</p>



<p>This isn’t a good look when Arena Breakout: Infinite enters early access in just a few days.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Battlestate Games to hopefully get the full scope of this issue.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-reveals-key-baldurs-gate-3-romance-stats-halsin-bear<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been one year since Baldur’s Gate 3 launched, and now, developer Larian Studios has revealed how players chose to navigate their journey through its Dungeons &amp; Dragons video game.</p><p>The studio unveiled a smorgasbord of stats in <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821186927779004770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a lengthy X/Twitter thread</u></a>. While it includes interesting data related to Baldur’s Gate 3’s soul-crushing permadeath Honour Mode and which characters fans favored over others, it also reveals that 1.9 million players were, at one point or another, turned into a wheel of cheese. </p><p>Another crucial stat update reveals that while everyone’s favorite dog, Scratch, was pet 120 million times, The Owlbear Cub and His Majesty the cat received only 41 million and 141,660 pet attempts, respectively. What matters most, though, is that we now know just how everyone chose to approach the game's romance options.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Over the last 12 months, you’ve smooched your companions a total of 75 Million times.</p><p>Please give them a break, their lips are losing pixels. <a href="https://t.co/6UWN45gri6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6UWN45gri6</a></p></div>— Baldur's Gate 3 (@baldursgate3) <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1821187589925122366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Larian’s posts include a nice selection of romance-related figures. Baldur’s Gate 3 companions have been kissed more than 75 million times in total, with Shadowheart leading the pack at a whopping 27 million kisses. Astarion is, unsurprisingly, in second at 15 million smooches, with poor Minthara in last with 169,937. We also have a look at some stats about Halsin, Larian’s infamous Druid character. Of the 658,000 players who had sex with Halsin, 70% chose to sleep with him in his human form, while the other 30% chose his grizzly bear form.</p><p>In all of Baldur’s Gate 3, Astarion proved to be the most-played as Origin being at 1.21 million characters created with him to start. That’s a lot of High Elf Rogues running around, but Larian does clarify that 93% of players did choose to create their own custom character when beginning an adventure. Meanwhile, while 141,660 players managed to complete Honour Mode, a staggering 1,223,305 playthroughs ended in a loss.</p><p>As for some of the more important story moments achievable in Baldur’s Gate 3, 3.3 million users managed to kill the Netherbrain, while another 1.8 million chose to betray the mind-flayer emperor. Interestingly, only 34 players who chose Lae’zel as their Origin character also chose to kill themselves at the end of the game.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Astarion has been your favourite Origin character avatar, shortly followed by the wizard of Waterdeep and, of course, God’s favourite princess.</p><p>However, over 93% of players chose to play as a custom avatar. Nice. <a href="https://t.co/rzyj3scKPx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rzyj3scKPx</a></p></div>— Baldur's Gate 3 (@baldursgate3) <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1821187431758229949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Baldur’s Gate 3 is a game of near-infinite possibilities, and that’s one of the biggest reasons players fell in love with it last summer. Despite so much to offer at launch, Larian has continued to deliver more content in post-launch updates, with many speculating that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-may-finally-add-everyones-favorite-bard-to-the-party"><u>Alfira may be added as a new companion</u></a> when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-delayed"><u>Patch 7 arrives soon</u></a>.</p><p>While we wait for Larian to expand on the already massive world of Baldur’s Gate 3, be sure to read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>10/10 review</u></a>. At the time of its launch in July 2023, we said, “With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

All told, <strong>this budget-friendly Capcom bundle comes with 41 games</strong>, which breaks down to roughly 75 cents per game.</p><p>Humble Bundles make it easy to add a bunch of great PC games to your Steam library for drastically reduced prices while also supporting a worthy cause. By default, proceeds from each bundle purchased are split between Humble, game publishers, and a charitable organization. You can adjust the ratio of your donation to allocate more or less to each entity. The Capcom Summer 2024 Humble Bundle supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Breakthrough TD.

This compilatio includes the first three games in the Ace Attorney series--Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations--and upgrades the experience with high-definition graphics. There's also <strong>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</strong>, which includes the spin-off games The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures and The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve. Neither game released in the west when on Nintendo DS, and these upgraded versions were given the same level of care as the Phoenix Wright trilogy.</p><p>Phoenix Wright fans will also likely enjoy <strong>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</strong>. Directed by Ace Attorney creator Shu Takumi, this brilliant puzzle-adventure game didn't garner nearly as large of an audience as it deserved when it first launched for Nintendo DS in 2010, but Capcom gave it a new lease on life last year. Ghost Trick holds an "Overwhelmingly Positive" user rating on Steam.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347032-greatace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347032-greatace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347032"></a><figcaption>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347032-greatace.jpg"></figure><p>If you like over-the-top action games loaded with flesh-eating zombies, Capcom's <strong>Dead Rising series</strong> is heavily represented in the bundle by four games. Finally, RPG fans can also check out <strong>Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen</strong>, which has become a cult classic since its release back in 2013.</p><hr><h2>More Humble Bundles</h2><p>The impressive Capcom bundle may be Humble's newest offer, but it's certainly not the only bundle that's worth checking out right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/good-news-chooms-cyberpunk-nexus-is-coming-to-demiplane<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> support is coming to the VTT Demiplane. R Talsorian Games has announced Cyberpunk Nexus for the platform, providing players with convenient compendiums and character options all to help them start their journey in Night City on the right foot.</p>
<h2>The Cyberpunk Nexus Announcement</h2>
<p>The Cyberpunk Nexus announcement was made by a <a href="https://x.com/DemiplaneRPG/status/1821229253188350161?t=EbPKc85AglPujTYgMDt9tw&amp;s=19">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) by the official R Talsorian Games account. The post simply states that Cyberpunk Red will have a new home on the platform this Fall. There is no mention of price or what content will be supported.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-red-martial-artist-artwork.jpg?itok=oXYhO5Q- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-red-martial-artist-artwork.jpg?itok=N8Of2kAF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This announcement is important given Demiplane's prominence in the tabletop space. The platform is known for putting all material for supported TTRPGs in one convenient spot. There's no need to keep multiple supplements tabbed; it's all in one space. Whether it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>World of Darkness</em></a>, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/demiplane-partners-with-darrington-press-to-launch-candela-obscura-nexus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>, you were covered.</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk Red</em> is the latest edition of the dark future sci-fi TTRPG created by Mike Pondsmith. This TTRPG full of cyborg ninjas, brain-melting hackers corporate espionage, and lethal car chases has received plenty of support since launch. These include the <em>Interface RED</em> volumes, the <em>Tales From The Red</em> anthology book, and a mission kit based on the Netflix anime <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</em></a>.</p>
<p>The responses to the Cyberpunk Nexus announcement did include one pertinent question. If someone already owns <em>Cyberpunk Red</em> material on Roll20. will they need to pay again for that content on Demiplane? This is an honest question since Roll20 officially <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired Demiplane</a> back in June.</p>
<p>The official Demiplane account's response was brief and diplomatic. They are still in talks with R Talsorian Games regarding how purchases will be handled across platforms. Given it's an issue of whether or not dedicated players will need to double dip, it is something both companies are taking seriously.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215375/fortnite-battle-pass-rewards-back-around-item-shop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games is making a major change to <em>Fortnite</em>’s<em> </em>battle passes that should remove some angst if you can’t buy or complete a pass before the end of a season.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s battle passes offer a bunch of exclusive in-game rewards that you can only obtain during an individual season, but that means you might miss out on rewards entirely if you can’t level up enough or don’t buy the pass before it expires. To help alleviate that pressure, Epic <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes">announced on Wednesday</a> that items from future battle passes might be available for purchase in <em>Fortnite</em>’s item shop at least 18 months after the pass expires.</p><p>Epic’s battle pass policy adjustment is intended in part to let people buy outfits featuring licensed crossovers, even if they miss a season’s battle pass, the company writes in its blog post. (Some of the game’s best skins, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man">Iron Man</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5">the Mandalorian</a>, have only been available to players who bought previous battle passes featuring those characters.)</p><p>Every type of item in a battle pass is eligible to show up in the shop, Epic says, including “Outfits, Back Blings, Pickaxes, Emotes, Instruments, Decals, Wraps, Loading Screens, Banner Icons, and more.” However, items from battle passes won’t be guaranteed to show up in the item shop after that 18-month window, so if you see something you want, you should probably get it while the pass is still available.</p><p>This change will kick in with the game’s next season, Epic spokesperson Stephanie Thoensen tells <em>The Verge</em>. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163374/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked-battle-pass-fallout-magneto">current season</a> ends on August 16th. The new season is <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1781230707559256172">rumored to be Marvel-themed</a> and could feature Doctor Doom, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209499/marvel-robert-downey-jr-doomsday-russo-bros-salaries">would make some sense</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-on-your-desk-jess-weatherbed.947298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24212190/work-home-desk-cthulhu-msi-logitech<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Jess Weatherbed, news writer for <em>The Verge</em>, started her professional career in a way she describes as “a bit strange for a journalist” — in prosthetics and wig making. However, she was no stranger to tech. For around 16 years, she’s been using drawing tablets to support her design hobbies, everything from digital illustration and animation to 3D sculpting. “I initially learned to build computers to support my nerdier gaming hobbies,” she says, “and my love of tech and gadgets has grown from there.”</p><p>We asked Jess to talk about her workspace.</p><p><strong>That’s quite a setup. Where in your home is it?</strong></p><p>This is technically our second bedroom or “guest room” — though it mostly serves as my permanent home office and gaming den. My partner and I purchased our first apartment a couple of years ago now. It’s super dinky, so there’s not much room for privacy! We wanted to keep our work areas completely separate to avoid distracting each other, so this is the best use of the space we have until we can move somewhere bigger. I’m also fully remote, so having everything set up in here gives me an extra space to frequent besides the bedroom or lounge.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Green gives the home office a restful but nicely gothic atmosphere.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><strong>That’s a lot of green.</strong></p><p>Would you believe me if I said my favorite color is actually orange? I really love green, though, and I’ve wanted a gloomy, gothic space since I was in my teens. I knew I would be spending a lot of time in here, and after years of renting, I just decided to go all in.&nbsp;</p><p>I had two main motivations. First, I wanted to see if I could put together a witch-themed setup that contrasts with the usual pastel palettes I see released for hardware that targets female gamers (which is lovely but isn’t at all my vibe).</p><p>The second was that I just find green to be a very calming color. I once <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/green-light-migraine-relief">read a study that green light can help reduce migraines</a>, and while I wasn’t aware of that at the time of decorating, it’s certainly correlated with my own experience as a chronic sufferer. I have a dimly lit space to hide in when needed, and with all the color-addressable lighting available these days — the ceiling lights being <a href="https://twinkly.com/en-gb/products/strings-multicolor?srsltid=AfmBOoq4hinjryybQU-smY33FrTQG0VYPbL0-GbKV8HRjqAWFr3vh6cj&amp;variant=42970659094750">Twinkly’s Strings</a> — I can switch it up if I want a brighter environment.</p><div><p>Twinkly has the best selection of holiday string lights in sizes ranging from 26 to 158 feet and with options that include just color, color and white, or just white. The lights are bright and colorful, and the effects you can find and create in the Twinkly app are very impressive. But the app is fiddly, and these Wi-Fi lights suffer from connectivity issues.</p></div><p>The entire apartment is, shall we say, “eclectically” decorated, so there’s a lot going on. It certainly isn’t for everyone, but I’m super happy with it. (And my partner has yet to veto any of my decorative choices, so it’s a win-win.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell us about your desk.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is the <a href="https://friskadesk.com/products/stockholm-height-adjustable-corner-desk">Friska Stockholm corner desk</a>, an electric sit-stand option I hoped would encourage me to stand more frequently during the day. Alas, I am a creature of bad habits. It does, however, give me plenty of space to create a sort of split workspace — I sit on the right when using my main two displays for work, while the left-hand “monitor” is actually a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HUION-Graphics-Drawing-Full-Laminated-Anti-Glare/dp/B099555ZBZ?tag=theverge02-20">Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K display drawing tablet</a>. If I want to focus on creative stuff, I can just swivel around.</p><p>If I can get around to sorting out the jungle of cables underneath, I’ll start looking for a compact electric treadmill that I can use to get some steps in to make full use of the desk’s sit / stand capabilities.</p><div><p>4K UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution tablet with a 23.8-inch screen.</p></div><p><strong>And your chair?</strong></p><p>The chair is a <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2Frazer-enki-pro">Razer Enki Pro</a>, which was an old review sample I retained a couple of years ago before joining <em>The Verge</em>. It’s taken a beating since then, having moved apartments and been dragged to various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party">LAN events</a>, but it’s holding up well aside from a few scratches. You can see I’ve started concealing them using stickers. The upholstery is still in good condition, though, and I can see this lasting me several years. I certainly wouldn’t advocate spending this much on a gaming-style chair unless you had specific comfort requirements, but I’m happy with it overall. Plus, it’s black and green!</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The green lighting is echoed by the mechanical keyboard.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><strong>Here’s the big one: tell us about the various tech devices you’re using.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>My main monitors are an <a href="https://us.msi.com/Monitor/Optix-G271/Specification">MSI Optix G271</a> and a hand-me-down <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.acer.com/en-ie/predator-xb1-gaming-monitor-xb271hk">Acer Predator XB271HK</a> 4K — both 27 inches. The PC itself is running an Intel i9-11900K, an MSI RTX 3080 GPU, and 64GB of DDR4 RAM. I’ll upgrade to DDR5 at some point, but for now, this is more than enough to handle both my gaming and creative hobbies.</p><p>The keyboard is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Optical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B09C12L49Z?tag=theverge02-20">Razer Huntsman V2</a>, which is… fine. I really like how plush the wrist rest is, and the built-in audio controllers at the top right feel nice and tactile. The mechanical keys are a tad clunky, though, so I’ll be looking to go the DIY kit route when this eventually bites the dust. The mouse is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20">Razer Basilisk V3</a>, which is one of the more ergonomic gaming mice I’ve used. I’d opt for a vertical mouse, but I really hate switching my gear around between work and gaming-optimized peripherals, and this hasn’t given me any reason to make the switch.&nbsp;</p><div><p>This wired gaming mouse from Razer is a favorite among gamers. It features 11 programable buttons,  optical mouse switches, and even an ergonomic thumb rest. You can cycle the scroll wheel between three different modes and, of course, customize the RGB to your heart’s content.</p></div><p>I’m still recovering from my “RGB in all of the things” phase, so if I’m being honest, I mostly just appreciate that I can synchronize the lighting effects across my Razer Synapse-supported gear (as janky as it is) without messing with third-party apps. Are they the best? Far from it, but they work for me and my black / green theming!</p><p>I frequently play<em> D&amp;D</em> online, so a lot of the other equipment supports both that and attending virtual meetings.

			<p>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has an official release date. The crafting game developed by Free Range Games and published by North Beach Games. This game is set in the Fourth Age of Middle Earth, the beloved fantasy world created by legendary J.R.R. Tolkien. For those who have been eagerly awaiting the release of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, this game will be releasing on August 27 for PC and Xbox Series X|S for a huge discounted price of $19.99.</p>
<p>Due to the release of the game on new platforms, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria will also be getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-qa-dev-talks-post-launch-roadmap-and-having-the-genres-best-combat/">the update</a> "The Golden Update," which includes crossplay across all platforms, as well as a Sandbox Mode. There will also be plenty of more content throughout the new update, as well as updates and quality-of-life improvements that have been implemented since the release of the game on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>These updates have been live on PC via the Epic Games Store since October 24, 2023. The updates have been live on PlayStation 5 since December 5, 2023.</p>
<p>The Sandbox Mode has been in beta via the EGS version of the game, and is now fully launched across all platforms for players. It allows players to have the full potential of the procedural generation system, with the game generated through a wide range of random seeds. Every playthrough has the potential to have significant difficulty changes, with layouts varying massively.</p>
<p>As this Sandbox Mode is highly unpredictable, it's recommended that people play this mode once they are familiar with Return to Moria or other survival games that are similar.</p>
<p>With the crossplay elements, players on any platform can now host a game, with players on Steam able to host 8-player sessions, with players from any platform being able to join.</p>
<p>Along with the Sandbox feature and the Crossplay feature, there are also new armors and weapons that have been added to the game. There are 14 new weapons and armor in total including a Wolf Skin Hat, Gondorian Shield, Khazad Halberd and much more. These items are only discoverable through the Sandbox Mode, but they can be transferred to the player's campaign as long as the Dwarf is equipped with the items as they transfer over.</p>
<p>One of the most important functions added in this update is the ability for players in single-player game modes to pause the game. In addition to this, players can also fine-tune their difficulty settings, which includes how aggressive enemies are, combat <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and more</a>.</p>

Now, a new WWE game mode, called Slam Deathmatch, along with several wrestling legends available as operators, has once again pulled me back into the <em>MW3</em> fray.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Season 5 of <em>Warzone </em>and <em>MW3</em> added new base weapons, a new battle pass that includes WWE superstar Rhea Ripley, two other famous wrestler skins available to purchase (Cody Rhodes and Rey Mysterio), and a temporary new game mode called Slam Deathmatch running as a cross promo with WWE SummerSlam (which aired on August 3). It’s that last bit (and Rhea Ripley) that got me to jump back into the shooter after months away, and boy, am I glad I did. Slam Deathmatch is absolutely bananas, and a great way to get a feel for the current (and ever-shifting) <em>CoD</em> gun meta.<br></p><p>Slam Deathmatch is simple: it’s regular Team Deathmatch on smaller-sized maps, but you down enemies like in <em>Warzone </em>rather than outright killing them, and your grenades are disabled. When you down a player, a WWE logo will appear over their head, and you can run over and long-press your right joystick to do a finishing move on them while a WWE announcer shouts in disbelief. These aren’t the same finishing moves as the traditional <em>CoD </em>ones, but wrestling-themed maneuvers that include bringing a folding chair down on someone’s neck or pulling off Cody Rhodes’ famous Cross Rhodes finisher. </p><p>The first time I pulled one of these moves off, I let out a shocked little laugh—especially because I was using the Farah operator skin, who is portrayed by <em>The Boys</em> actor Claudia Domit. The rest of the match was predictably chaotic, with players flipping and slamming each other all over the map and bullets flying everywhere (you can’t take damage while doing a finisher, but they can be interrupted by enemies), and voice comms full of players laughing and groaning like the crowd at a major wrestling event. The next match, I was able to do a Rhea Ripley finisher while using my Rhea Ripley skin, and yeah, it was as satisfying as you’d imagine.<br></p><p>Slam Deathmatch is a great reminder that <em>Call of Duty</em> can be fun sometimes. Your last chance to play it is today, so get to it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You press one button and you take on a series of bosses. It’s a simple premise that developer Midnight Munchies delivers on and then some. With just one button, you might think that the game would get boring quickly or lack depth—but it’s just the opposite. <em>One Btn Bosses</em> is an enthralling game that constantly adds new challenges to master.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196789,195410" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I already explained the premise and it truly doesn’t go much further than that. Each level gives you control of a moving object stuck on a track. The one button you use changes your direction of movement along the track (which can be shaped like a circle, square, a straight line, and more) so as to get out of the way of oncoming attacks from enemies. You also have the ability to attack, but with your singular input already taken by directional control, <em>One Btn Bosses</em> ties attacks to movement speed. The faster you move, the more projectiles you fire back at your opponent; switching directions lowers your speed, after which point it must be built up again. This creates a balancing act in the deceptively simple game. You have to avoid hazards but you also want to make quick work of enemies, which means you have to strategically choose exactly when to shift direction in order to maintain your highest speed as long as possible.</p><p>Staying true to its name, <em>One Btn Bosses</em> never gives you more than a single input, but each level still changes things up thanks to differences in enemy attack patterns. At the start you’ll face enemies who just shoot projectiles back at you, but over time they’ll start launching bombs with large areas of effect, missiles that home in on you, and special bullets that ricochet around a track—and that’s only a few of the tactics you can expect to encounter. It turns what could be a repetitive gameplay loop into a frantic fight for your life. Not long into the game, you’re faced with situations in which the screen is almost entirely filled with attacks you have to avoid with just one button at your disposal. But to give you a fighting chance, <em>One Btn Bosses</em> does offer up alternatives to your basic direction switch.<br></p><p>By collecting GP (Grind Points) after completing levels, you slowly unlock different abilities to equip that change what your button press does. One early skill you acquire can switch out your basic directional movement for a dash that lets you speed through attacks instead of having to turn around to avoid them. But new abilities don’t just alter how you move; they can also change how you attack, replacing your bullets with a laser or allowing you to bounce enemy attacks back. Midnight Munchies boasts that there are over 100 combinations of abilities to try out. However, the game’s levels feel tailored to the basic setup you start with. I spent a lot of time trying other skills, and really liked how the dash felt in certain levels, but I found myself returning to the default abilities often as they felt best suited for every challenge.</p><figure id="" data-id="d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-recommend-id="image://d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow ship runs along a track and avoids large pink hazards" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A yellow ship runs along a track and avoids large pink hazards" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Midnight Munchies / Outersloth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-recommend-id="image://d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow ship runs along a track and avoids large pink hazards" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>One Btn Bosses</em> has a short, four-hour campaign that’s mostly an extended tutorial to get you into the game’s headspace. There’s a cute—if basic and unimportant—plot about working your way up the cutthroat corporate ladder, but gameplay is king here. That’s why <em>One Btn Bosses</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-guess-i-actually-like-roguelikes-now-1845131675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-guess-i-actually-like-roguelikes-now-1845131675">roguelike</a></span> mode might be the best thing about it. Once unlocked in the first fifteen minutes or so, you can dive into roguelike levels at any time. As per genre conventions, you run through a series of levels and unlock random skills after each boss to use on the next level. While abilities don’t always seem that useful in the campaign, the roguelike mode makes using and mastering each new skill fun. <em>One Btn Bosses</em> is all about momentum and the roguelike mode perfectly distills that. Yet even when going through the campaign, the game’s tight level design never ceases to amaze.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/">Game Informer would be closing its doors</a> after 33 years in operation, a decision made by the site's parent company, GameStop. Shortly thereafter, a former staffer used the publication's official Twitter account to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-game-informer-staffer-offers-an-actual-farewell-be-well-play-well/1100-6525532/">offer a "genuine goodbye,"</a> but Game Informer's Twitter account was deleted within minutes of the post. Now, former editor-in-chief Matt Miller has taken to Twitter to share his own official goodbye message with readers and former colleagues alike.</p><p dir="ltr">"33 years is a long time," Miller stated. "When thinking about saying goodbye to Game Informer, I felt that a few days of consideration were warranted to get my thoughts in order. I’m glad I waited. The outpouring of affection, support, and appreciation the team has received in recent days is humbling, it has reminded me how much this long-running magazine has meant to so many."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MatthewRMiller/status/1821219698886713829" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I've never been big into posting social media, preferring to let our official channels speak for themselves.

"I still love games, and I hope to find a new way to stay connected to them through my work."</p><p dir="ltr">Game Informer first launched in August 1991, and was acquired by GameStop in 2000. According to the publication's displaced staff, employees were informed of GameStop's decision to shut down Game Informer the same day it was announced to the public. The magazine's writers, editors, and other staffers were reportedly given no warning, and were <a href="https://x.com/KyleMHilliard/status/1819403288980132298" rel="nofollow ">in the midst of working on the next issue</a> of Game Informer's print magazine--which will not be completed--when the announcement was made. <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/" rel="nofollow ">Game Informer's website</a> was also taken down almost immediately after the news broke, but parts of the site can still be accessed via online archival tools like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/gameinformer.com/" rel="nofollow ">Wayback Machine</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">368 issues of Game Informer were printed and published during its 33-year run.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Six characters will make up the playtest's roster: Ahri, Braum, Darius, Ekko, Illaoi, and Yasuo. Each will be unlocked from the start, but Riot says future playtests may require players to unlock additional fighters through missions or with credits. There will be four stages to choose from, as well as a battle pass for players to progress through that includes skins for Ahri and Yasua alongside additional rewards like currency, avatar emotes, stickers, and other customization options. Casual and private matches will be available with cross-play enabled for those playing in the same region. A tutorial, as well as a training mode, will also be playable. This playtest will not include an offline or local play option.</p><p dir="ltr">The Alpha Lab playtest will be the first good look at how 2XKO handles its in-game lobbies, and will see players creating customizable chibi avatars that can be used to run around a virtual arcade filled with 2XKO cabinets, similar to lobby systems seen in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/street-fighter-6/" data-ref-id="5000-558635">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"We think playing with friends and making new ones is an amazing part of the fighting game experience, so our lobbies are built to bring that vibe to an online space," Riot says.</p><p dir="ltr">None of the progress made towards the Alpha Lab playtest battle pass or currency earned will carry forward to future playtests, of which Riot says there will be more later this year. At the end of the playtest, players will receive a feedback survey the developer is encouraging every participant to fill out.</p><p dir="ltr">"Testing at this stage will give us time to incorporate feedback before launch," Riot says. "Basically, this is your chance to actually shape 2XKO with your notes."</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO is being planned for a 2025 launch, and it's looking to bring some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2xko-looks-to-bring-tag-based-fighting-games-into-a-new-era/1100-6525311/" data-ref-id="1100-6525311">major changes to the tag-based fighter formula</a>, including its support for up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-l-league-of-legends-fighting-game-lets-you-play-2v2-with-four-players/1100-6516321/" data-ref-id="1100-6516321">four players in its 2v2 matches</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-solstice-2024-start-date-rewards-and-everything-we-know/2900-5615/" data-ref-id="2900-5615">Solstice of Heroes</a> has kicked off for 2024, and with it comes Fortunate Star, a new weapon you can only earn during the summertime event. Fortunate Star is a new bow with perks that can make it very effective in PvE play, especially if you're using Void or Prismatic builds that take advantage of Void debuffs. Here's everything you need to know about Fortunate Star, from where to get it to what rolls you want to chase.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Fortunate_Star">How To Get Fortunate Star</a></li><li><a href="#Fortunate_Star_God_Rolls">Fortunate Star God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Fortunate_Star_PvE_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Fortunate_Star_PvP_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Fortunate_Star">How To Get Fortunate Star</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunate Star is specifically part of the Solstice loot pool, which means you won't get it from playing other activities. The quickest and easiest way to get one is by taking part in Bonfire Bash activities. You'll have a chance to get Fortunate Stars as you complete each run, alongside other Solstice weapons like Compass Rose, Something New, and Crowning Duologue.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also chances to get Fortunate Stars from Solstice packages, which you can earn from completing Solstice and Forge bounties as part of the event and from completing certain Triumphs on the Solstice event card. Generally, though, you're going to get tons of Fortunate Stars from Bonfire Bash, which should make chasing good rolls easy enough.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346529-20240806172120_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346529" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346529-20240806172120_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346529"></a><figcaption>Fortunate Star</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346529-20240806172120_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortunate_Star_God_Rolls">Fortunate Star God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fortunate_Star_PvE_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bowstring</strong>: Polymer Bowstring / Agile Bowstring  <ul><li dir="ltr">Polymer Bowstring: +5 Accuracy, +10 Charge Time, -36 Draw Time</li><li dir="ltr">Agile Bowstring: +15 Handling, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Arrow</strong>: Fiberglass Arrow Shaft / Compact Arrow Shaft  <ul><li dir="ltr">Fiberglass Arrow Shaft: +15 Accuracy, -5 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Compact Arrows Shaft: +10 Handling, +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Repulsor Brace  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Destabilizing Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows cause nearby targets to become Volatile.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Draw Time / Handling</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can get a couple of decent combinations with Fortunate Star, but the most useful one is going to be a Void-centric roll best utilized with Void and Prismatic builds. That means you want Destabilizing Rounds and Repulsor Brace, which give the one-two punch of turning enemies Volatile and then rewarding you with an overshield for killing them. Alongside a Void or Prismatic build that utilizes invisibility or Devour, you can get a lot of awesome synergy from this role.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, a combination like Successful Warmup or Archer's Tempo and Golden Tricorn will speed the Draw Time on Fortunate Star while boosting its damage. Coupled with a focus on Draw Time in the bowstring, arrows, and Masterwork, you can get the bow firing relatively quickly. A better focus might be the Handling stat, though, which you can boost up all the way to 100, making Fortunate Star very smooth to use with other weapons for a more rounded build.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fortunate_Star_PvP_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bowstring</strong>: Polymer Bowstring  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Accuracy, +10 Charge Time, -36 Draw Time</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Arrow</strong>: Fiberglass Arrow Shaft  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Accuracy, -5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Hip-Fire Grip / Archer's Tempo  <ul><li dir="ltr">Hip-Fire Grip: Increases accuracy, stability, and precision-hit targeting when firing from the hip.</li><li dir="ltr">Archer's Tempo: Precision hits decrease Draw Time by 25% for 3 seconds.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Archer's Gambit  <ul><li dir="ltr">Hip-fire precision hits grant a massive draw-speed bonus for a short period of time.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Draw Time</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Fortunate Star is best used in PvE with its Void synergy, but it has some decent PvP rolls as well. Combining Hip-Fire Grip and Archer's Gambit gives you some serious benefits if you can land hits when firing from the hip--you get a boost to accuracy and then a major boost to draw time, allowing you to fire fast and land hits quickly. Alternatively, Archer's Tempo can do the job without requiring you to fire from the hip exclusively, and can be great when paired with Precision Instrument to help you land headshots and win duels.</p><p dir="ltr">Generally, you want to focus on decreasing the draw time of Fortunate Star and increasing its accuracy with your bowstring, arrow, and Masterwork choices, as well, to make this as accurate a weapon as possible that you can fire as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>
Epic Games has announced it's ditching a long-standing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> promise that Battle Pass items will never be made available to buy at a later date - although it's implementing an 18-month wait period before items can appear in its in-game shop.
</p>
<p>
It's a rule Epic has been accused of breaking before, specifically when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-furious-summer-drift-style-being-sold">released a beachwear version of Fortnite's season 5 poster boy Drift</a> for purchase in 2019 - but the practice of releasing paid variants of previous Battle Pass characters has become commonplace in the years since.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Epic is ditching the rule entirely so that any item released as part of a Battle Pass in the future can be sold in the Fortnite Shop, provided 18 months have passed since the Battle Pass' release. "This change lets us continue investing in new and exciting Battle Pass rewards" the developer wrote in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes">blog post</a>, "while enabling players down the road to also enjoy the content, including Outfits based on popular licensed characters."

<p>
Epic notes there's "no guarantee" a Battle Pass item will come to the Fortnite Shop following these changes to its exclusivity rules, adding it'll let players know if it releases a future Battle Pass item that'll "never" appear in the shop.
</p>
<p>
An accompanying FAQ confirms the rule changes apply to all Battle Pass items, meaning Outfits, Back Blings, Pickaxes, Emotes, Instruments, Decals, Wraps, Loading Screens, Banner Icons, and more. Bonus Rewards and Quest Rewards, as well as items earned from mid-season Battle Pass quests, will also be eligible to purchase after 18 months - as will any item alt Styles, but the number available may vary each time the item comes to the shop.
</p>
<p>
Epic adds the changes will not impact the pricing of Fortnite's Battle Passes, which will continue to cost 950 V-Bucks and provide the opportunity to earn 1500 V-Bucks by levelling up.
</p>

In other news, developer Mediatonic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite">bean-based battle royale Fall Guys now exists within Fortnite</a>, some nine months after the UK studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-developer-hit-hard-by-epic-games-layoffs-but-studio-to-remain-open">severely impacted</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">job cuts at Epic Games</a> that ultimately affected 830 workers. Epic insists it currently doesn't "have anything to announce" when asked if it plans to move <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>' development solely into Fortnite.

Unlike previous <em>Call of Duty</em> games, players will b able run and jump in any direction in the upcoming game. “This innovation immediately allows the player to move like never before and seamlessly chain combat maneuvers together, like sliding, diving and a newly enhanced supine prone, all with a full 360 degrees range of motion,” Activision <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-worldwide-reveal-announcement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-worldwide-reveal-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back in June</a></span> about the new feature. </p><p>Omnimovement is shaping up to make<em> Black Ops 6</em> the fastest, twitchiest <em>Call of Duty </em>yet, but low gravity mods shows it can also turn shootouts into<em> Max Payne</em>-style bullet time showdowns on the moon. Diving in <em>Max Payne 3 </em>was one of the best parts, it was basically the third-person shooter equivalent of a roll dodge. <em>Helldivers 2</em> also has very flexible sprinting and diving mechanics, and there’s nothing more satisfying than spraying and praying while lunging through the air, even if it results in you getting killed. </p><p>And low gravity or not, that’s probably going to happen to me a whole lot in <em>Black Ops 6</em>. The first beta weekend starts August 30 for Game Pass subscribers and those who pre-order the game. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
