			<p>Once again, rumors have begun swirling about the next Xbox first-party game to be ported to PlayStation 5, and it might be one of the most iconic (albeit niche): Microsoft Flight Simulator.</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaker extas1s <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> it would be Forza Horizon 5. However, an earlier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1etc9z9/the_next_xbox_port_will_be_flight_sim_according/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from January had mentioned Microsoft Flight Simulator, and it was right about everything it shared at the time.</p>
<p><em>Xbox will probably announce its multiplatform plans late next month or right before the fiscal year ends. ID Software's next game is no longer an Xbox exclusive and will be multiplatform. Bethesda's next few games that were exclusive have also been pushed to be multiplatform instead.</em></p>
<p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator will be multiplatform, and a few other older 1st party games are also going to be multiplatform. Indiana Jones is a little weird cause he's modeled after Harrison Ford to the full extent but being voiced by Troy Baker. Most of the game is also 1st person, including whip combat.</em> <em>And Hideo Kojima is finally making a movie.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages turned out to be multiplatform, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a first-person game (except for rare instances during environmental interaction) with Harrison Ford's likeness and Troy Baker's voiceover. A few days after the leak, PlayStation also announced a partnership with Hideo Kojima on a new stealth IP called <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physint</a>, which will include the production of a game and a movie.</p>
<p>If the leaker is right about Microsoft Flight Simulator, too, the question then becomes whether the 'old' 2020 game would be ported or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new</a> installment that is slated to launch on November 19. This new entry features several new mission types, new aircraft types, more environmental features (snow and tornadoes), a full-fledged season system, improved physics, better performance with multithreading, and even the ability to step out of the plane and walk around the environments, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/flight-simulator-2024s-huge-ambition-means-you-can-now-exit-the-plane-walk-around-you-can-land-on-every-ship-and-it-looks-like-a-first-person-shooter-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> recently to PC Gamer.</p>
<p>Whether Microsoft Flight Simulator or Forza Horizon 5 gets to PlayStation 5 first, Xbox's multiplatform policy suggests both will eventually make it and if Sea of Thieves' success is anything to go by, they might thrive, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exoborne-gameplay-trailer-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Exoborne’s gameplay trailer is finally here, and it showcases a perfectly intense and high-octane extraction shooter experience that’s bursting at the seams with action-oriented sequences and futuristic combat elements. </p>



<p>In the short but punchy trailer, we get a glimpse at the upcoming first- and third-person shooter that fuses unpredictable weather patterns with high-tech exoskeletons to present an extraction shooter experience like no other.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-master-the-apocalypse">Master The Apocalypse</h2>



<p>Exoborne is a promising, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter set in a world torn apart. Players enter a series of environments armed to the teeth with technology, weapons, and abilities, seeking high-value rewards and loot, which they’ll then try to extract before the world around them becomes too much to bear.</p>



<p>It’s a PvPvE shooter, so it operates similarly to Escape from Tarkov and other extraction shooters, but it’s so much more intense and action-oriented.</p>



<p>Here’s the Exoborne gameplay trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Exoborne - Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehaixwsBHVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Players will be invited to explore expansive environments, making use of their traversal abilities to cut across the territory as efficiently as possible. They’ll be able to lean on vehicles, high-powered weapons, and a string of abilities including boost packs, grapple hooks, and deployable shields to ensure their survival.</p>



<p>Presently, the extraction shooter genre tends to lean towards slower-paced, realistic, and more ‘simulation-like’ elements than it does balls-to-the-wall action mechanics. Exoborne could be the disruptive title that shakes up the genre with reckless abandon.</p>

<p>Meta has finally confirmed that it’s shelving the GTA San Andreas VR project. After months of speculation that have unravelled more than three years after the team announced a VR remake of San Andreas, it has been put on indefinite hold as the company pivots to focus on other projects.</p>



<p>Despite the game having been in development for several years, it has been brought to a sudden and decisive stop by Meta, marking a disappointing confirmation for VR fans everywhere.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grove-street-home">‘Grove Street… Home’</h2>



<p>I don’t like VR games at the best of times, but I would have played the heck out of GTA San Andreas VR. Imagine it – hopping on a BMX and cycling down into Grove Street, walking around the Johnson house, and performing brutal drive-bys against the opps. It would have been a fantastic way to experience <strong>again </strong>one of the best games ever made.</p>



<p>In a statement posted to YouTube, the Meta Quest team confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>GTA: San Andreas is on hold indefinitely while we both focus on other projects. We look forward to working with our friends at Rockstar in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s it – it’s the end of the era. It was back in 2021 that the Meta Quest team announced it was working on San Andreas VR, but by today, no solid gameplay or even screenshots of the game have surfaced, suggesting they didn’t get too far with the project.</p>



<p>Would you have played a GTA San Andreas VR remake if it had surfaced?</p>

			<p>The horror game Slitterhead just received a new story trailer. Developed by Bokeh Game Studio (founded by former Silent Hill co-creator Keiichiro Toyama), Slitterhead is <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-gets-gameplay-trailer-pc-specs-and-november-8-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> to launch on November 8 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slitterhead - Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EENlMq23sE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's a detailed overview provided by Bokeh Game Studio, which is self-publishing Slitterhead:</p>
<p><em>Set in the cluttered streets of Kowlong, a city filled with darkness and chaos, this combat action-adventure game casts the player as "Hyoki," a being without memory or physical form. His sole motive is to eradicate the monstrous creatures known as "Slitterheads" that crawl through the city disguised as humans.</em></p>
<p><em>As players roam the vibrant, neon-lit cityscape, they must find allies among the humans known as "Rarities," infiltrate and track down dangerous organizations, and engage in battles harnessing the power of blood. As the suspenseful drama unfolds, delve into the mystery behind Hyoki's existence and the appearance of the Slitterheads.</em></p>
<p><em>The entity known as "Hyoki" finds himself wandering amidst the chaos of Kowlong, plagued by the enigmatic monsters known as "Slitterheads" that mimic humans. Though robbed of all memories, he has a single-minded purpose: to exterminate every last Slitterhead. Infiltrating the city, he embarks on a mission to hunt down those who have been hiding in human society.</em></p>
<p><em>Without a physical form, Hyoki's ability allows him to possess and control human bodies at will, turning those who wander the city into his pawns. With this power, he can pass through barriers, assume the identity of specific individuals, and infiltrate dangerous areas and organizations. He can also move through the city at high speed by quickly changing hosts.</em></p>
<p><em>While human bodies are fragile, Hyoki can burn their life force and turn blood into weapons to fight the ferocious Slitterheads. Even when critically wounded, he can continue to fight by efficiently switching hosts. By possessing "Rarities," special humans who share a high synchronization with Hyoki, he can unleash even more powerful attacks and activate various abilities. The cooperative relationship with these "Rarities" is the key to uncovering the deepest secrets in Kowlong.</em></p>

            <p>For years, our PC storage has wobbled and buckled beneath the tyranny of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-defend-modern-warfare-3s-larger-install-size-promising-to-shrink-it-before-launch">gigantic Call Of Duty installs</a>. Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.</p><!--more-->
<p>Step one for Activision is "decoupling" the free-to-play live service battle royale Call Of Duty: Warzone from other aspects of the Call Of Duty experience. Makes sense - the Venn diagram of audiences for COD campaigns and Warzone isn't a perfectly circular aiming reticule. "When you purchase an annual title, you will only download the files for that game by default," explains <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap">an Activision blog</a>. "On the free-to-play side, players can 'opt-in' to get Call of Duty: Warzone when they're downloading a new annual title or simply download it separately at any point in time."</p>
<p>Step two is "expanding our usage of texture streaming". This will allow the developers to "cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage". The trade-off is that "you may see older content that briefly appears at a lower quality until the streaming cache has fully loaded", but you can always pick the new "Optimised" high fidelity graphics quality setting to spruce up the textures faster. There will also be a "Minimal" graphics quality for people who don't have internet bandwidth to spare.</p>
<p>To "pave the way" for all this, Activision want you to download a Call Of Duty update right now, a couple of weeks before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-early-access-and-open-beta-dates-revealed">the Black Ops 6 beta</a> and a few months ahead of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-a-release-date-for-the-end-of-october-open-beta-on-the-way">Black Ops 6 release date</a>. This will "[reorganise] game files and [add] new tech to prep the way for the full player interface arriving in October". It's a big file, but the developers promise that "this initial download will not permanently add the stated file size to the storage space that Call of Duty takes up on your device". Once you've installed it, you can expect Call Of Duty to take up less space over time.</p>
<p>I've fallen away from Call Of Duty for many reasons, but having to shovel hundreds of gigabytes into my PC each time is definitely a prominent one. On the other hand, I'm not confident my internet connection could handle the increased streaming load. What's your mileage?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India isn’t the most wide-open region when it comes to video games. Historically, the nation’s government has banned plenty of games, including the likes of Fallout 3, PUBG Mobile, and Free Fire. It maintains an iron-fisted grip on the functionality of certain apps in the country, but all that hasn’t stopped the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, from taking a positive stance on gaming in general.</p>



<p>Speaking recently during the nation’s 78th Independence Day celebrations, the Prime Minister of India made a bold pledge about the future of gaming across the country.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-entire-world">‘To The Entire World’</h2>



<p>Narendra Modi hasn’t ever been the biggest advocate for the gaming industry, but in recent years, he’s drifted a little closer to the concept of it all. </p>



<p>In April, he was snapped playing video games and interacting with some of the biggest influencers and competitive gamers in India, and now, he has made ambitious statements about the future of gaming in the country:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>India has a very rich heritage. We can bring new talent to the world of gaming. I want every Indian child, youth, IT professionals, and AI professionals of India to lead the world of gaming — not just in playing, but also in taking our gaming products to the entire world. We can establish our dominance in the world of animation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>During his recent sit-down with influencers, Mr. Modi played Stumble Guys on mobile and Beat Saber through a VR headset. He also enjoyed Raji, an adventure game built in and propagated throughout India.</p>



<p>Many governments around the world are actively supporting the growth of gaming and esports, welcoming the revenue that this rapidly expanding industry brings. India could be the next power player looking to make an impact on the landscape.</p>

    <p><span>Welcome to Natlan, the sixth major nation of Teyvat.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.0 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [116 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn,” will launch on August 28, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. The update will add Natlan, the game’s sixth major nation. <span id="more-906322"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Players will be able to reach the sixth major nation of Teyvat and ally with the warriors of the region, including Kachina, Kinich, and Mualani, as well as the Saurians of Natlan. Set off to discover diverse tribes, landscapes, mysteries, and legends.</p><p>The road to Natlan will open with an unlocked Teleport Waypoint that is accessible to players, even beginners and intermediates, who have completed the Prologue of the Archon Quest in Mondstadt. Known as the Nation of Pyro, Natlan is located west of the Sumeru desert. The people of this nation are divided into six main tribes. The dragons of Natlan, more commonly called Saurians, are the result of a long evolution and have evolved to coexist with humans, and they have even become their faithful companions. With Version 5.0, players will be able to explore three of the six tribes, as well as encounter three types of Saurians who live together with the locals.</p><p>Mastering the abilities of the different Saurians can prove decisive in exploring the towering cliffs and flowing springs, and players can transform into a Saurian by indwelling them. The Tepetlisaurus are Saurians good at tunneling undergrounds and climbing cliffs, and they are the companions of choice for the Children of Echoes who call the canyons their home. The Yumkasaurus can pull themselves in the chosen direction and reach great heights with ease. They have taken up residence among the Scions of the Canopy, a tribe living suspended from the walls of steep cliffs. As for the Koholasaurus, they can move quickly on water and liquid Phlogiston, which explains why they are commonly seen with the People of the Springs near the sea.</p><p>Natlan, also known as the Nation of War, honors her warriors at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, where the Champion of each tribe is chosen through a tournament. This is where the main story unfolds, as the player, accompanied by local warriors Kachina, Kinich, and Mualani, travel to the Stadium. To begin Natlan’s Archon Quest, players need to reach Adventure Rank 28 and above, and have completed all of Liyue’s Archon Quests.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Natlan warriors are masters of skills and agility that reflect the lifestyle and traditions of their own tribe. Kachina, the four-star Geo polearm wielder from the Children of Echoes, is able to summon Turbo Twirly and ride on it to scale walls and cliffs, and also pound the ground to deal AOE DMG. She can be recruited for free by completing Act I of Natlan’s Archon Quest. Kinich, renowned for his hunting skills in the Scions of the Canopy, is a five-star Dendro warrior equipped with a claymore who wields the grappling hook to perfection, so as to swing and easily reach heights, or to link to enemies and perform powerful Loop Shots. His special companion, Ajaw, can also join the fray, unleashing his dragon breath against foes. Mualani, the watersports shop owner from People of the Springs, is a Hydro five-star catalyst wielder who can mount her reliable Sharky Surfboard and move at full speed on the water surface, liquid Phlogiston, and even on dry land. In combat, when Mualani is moving on her Sharky Surfboard and hits an enemy, she applies a mark and administers Sharky’s Bite, which inflicts more damage after several hits.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_906333"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Although Kachina, Mualani, and Kinich are all capable of locating regional specialties, they have different talents of restoring Stamina, accumulating Phlogiston, or increasing movement speed respectively, which can benefit all party members by interacting with certain harvestable items. However, to take full advantage of the powers and abilities of warriors and Saurians living in the Nation of Pyro, players will need to consume or utilize Phlogiston in different forms wisely. Through a mysterious ritual known as Phlogiston Engravings, the warriors of Natlan can further distinguish themselves in battle thanks to the Nightsoul’s Blessing.</p><p>In Version 5.0’s Event Wishes, Mualani and Kachina will debut in the first phase along with Kaedehara Kazuha’s rerun, and Kinich’s debut will come with the Raiden Shogun in the second half. In the meantime, the stories of Natlan’s three new characters will be available through the Tribal Chronicles, a new three-act quest for each tribe that replace the previous Story <a title="Platforms > Quest [113 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, to provide a comprehensive experience for players to gain a deeper understanding of the stories, people, and traditions. Players can visit each tribe’s “Obsidian Totem Pole” to start the Tribal Chronicles, as well as their Bounties and Supply Notices to earn Reputation EXP and valuable rewards.</p><p>As the fourth anniversary of <em>Genshin Impact</em> approaches, rewards, and bonuses will be offered to celebrate this event with fans and players during Version 5.0. The special daily login event returns with up to Intertwined Fate ×10 for players to claim, and players can check their in-game mail to receive Primogems ×1,600, two exclusive gadgets “Firstborn Firesprite” and “Kaboom Box,” as well as more bonuses. Furthermore, players can also invite a 5-star character from the Standard Wish lineup to their team for free. More updates on the Character Event Wish, Weapon Event Wish, and a new tool to redeem Artifacts with designated affixes will also arrive in the latest version.</p></blockquote><p>And here is a detailed explanation of Natlan:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ 1. Three Characters in Natlan</strong></p><p><strong>1.1 Mualani</strong></p><p>Mualani is a five-star Hydro catalyst wielder from People of the Springs. This shiny and hot-hearted girl is a watersports store owner and a fan of multiple water sports, such as swimming, surfing, and beach volleyball. Mualani primarily deals Hydro damage with on-field movement to stack layers.</p><ul><li><strong>Surf to Explore</strong> – Her Elemental Skill makes her mount on her Sharky Surfboard to move on land, water and liquid Phlogiston with a greater speed. In addition, Mualani can surf onto the Spiritways, a flowing Phlogiston track that she can take for a fast trip.</li><li><strong>Surf, Mark, and Bite</strong> – Her Elemental Skill also converts her Normal Attacks into Sharky’s Bite of powerful Hydro damage. By making contact with enemies, Mualani can mark her enemies and gain stacks. Max 3 stacks, Mualani can unleash a reinforced bite with significant damage.</li></ul><p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Mualani" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Btbl2DlhGXI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>1.2 Kinich</strong></p><p>Kinich is a five-star Dendro claymore wielder from Scions of the Canopy. He is a well-known hunter with a special Saurian company, Ajaw.</p><ul><li><strong>Grappling Hook</strong> – With his Elemental Skill, Kinich can use a grappling hook to reach higher places and swing foward consecutively by latching onto Coilgrass Sigils during exploration.</li><li><strong>Loop Shoot</strong> – When using his Elemental Skill in the presence of nearby enemies, Kinich links to the target and initiates loop shots. In this state, he gradually accumulates Nightsoul Points, which, upon reaching their maximum, allow him to unleash a powerful shot, dealing significant Dendro DMG.</li><li><strong>Stand with Dragonlord</strong> – Upon his Elemental Burst, the Saurian buddy of Kinich, Ajaw, will unleash dragonbreaths to deal AoE Dendro DMG.</li></ul><p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Kinich" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zxqfr4jyry0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>1.3 Kachina</strong></p><p>Kachina is a four-star Geo polearm wielder from Children of Echoes.</p><ul><li><strong>Turbo Twirly</strong> – Kachina is able to summon Turbo Twirly and ride it to climb walls and cliffs in daily exploration, and also unleash ground-slam attacks to deal AoE Geo DMG in combat.</li><li><strong>Free to Get in Archon Quest</strong> – By completing the first act of Natlan Archon Quest, you can invite Kachina into your team for free.</li></ul><p><strong>■ 2. Phlogiston and Nightsoul’s Blessing</strong></p><p><strong>2.1 Phlogiston</strong></p><p>In the Nation of Pyro, the Pyro power can be found as a unique resource known as Phlogiston. Phlogiston exists in different forms and can be utilized by the locals as a brand-new resource to in movement and combat. Once you indwell a Saurian, you may notice that skills are consuming a separate Phlogiston bar on the right side of your Saurian body. For Natlan characters, a Phlogiston bar also appears above their health bar. In addition, the constant flowing Phlogiston can form a pathway named Spiritways, where Koholasaurus or People of the Springs can use for fast travels.</p><p><strong>2.2 Nightsoul’s Blessing</strong></p><p>Nightsoul’s Blessing state is unique for characters in Natlan, which will usually increase their mobility and combat abilities. For them, the Elemental Skill is the most convenient way to enter this state, and a Nightsoul bar will show on the left side of the character.</p><p><strong>■ 3. The First Three Tribes in Natlan</strong></p><p><strong>3.1 Children of Echoes</strong></p><p>The Children of Echoes is located in the canyons of northeast Natlan, giving rise to expert miners and talented dancers. There is a large stage that serves as the heart of their entertainment, where locals proudly showcase their dancing skills and passion for the arts.</p><p><strong>3.2 Scions of the Canopy</strong></p><p>If you’re an extreme sports enthusiast or simply want to take in breathtaking views, visit the Scions of the Canopy, the tribe cantilevered over the steep cliffs with cables. People there are highly skilled at navigating through jungles and forests and reaching high places with ease. These abilities make them exceptionally suited for the role of a courier.</p><p><strong>3.3 People of the Springs</strong></p><p>As a laidback tribe known for its hot springs, People of the Springs offers a relaxing vibe with various watersports and music. It’s an ideal place for locals to conquer the waves and enjoy beach volleyball. With the guidance of local guides, more stories and mysteries will be unveiled around this seaside tribe.</p><p><strong>■ 4. Three Types of Saurians and Saurian Indwelling</strong></p><p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Baby Saurian" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgQNYVpVKKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>4.1 Saurian Indwelling</strong></p><p>Saurian Indwelling is a unique transformation mechanism in Natlan. We can roam the land of Natlan in Saurian’s forms by indwelling them or respective Spiritscounces. In Version 5.0, players can indwell three types of Saurians, Teptlisaurus, Yumkasaurus, and Koholasaurus to experience their unique skills.</p><p>Check the video showcase of Indwelling and Saurian’s abilities in media kit –</p><p><em>—Teptlisaurus</em></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Saurian Indwelling - Tepetlisaurus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3sO5WeTdts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>—Yumkasaurus</em></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Saurian Indwelling - Yumkasaurus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tE8VusI8ud8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>—Koholasaurus</em></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Saurian Indwelling - Koholasaurus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3MUK1UFxf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>4.2 Tepetlisaurus</strong></p><p>The Tepetlisaurus can be a good helper of the Children of Echoes, renowned for its mining prowess. This Saurian may aid the tribe in excavating valuable minerals and carving pathways through rugged canyons. When indwelling a Tepetlisaurus, you gain the ability to burrow underground, climb cliffs, and even access hidden tunnels that swiftly transport you to the other side of obstacles.</p><p><strong>4.3 Yumkasaurus</strong></p><p>Beloved by the extreme sports lovers among the Scions of the Canopy, Yumkasaurus demonstrates unparalleled agility in reaching higher terrain. Yumkasaurus possesses a unique organ that drags it into the air with ease. Additionally, when it consumes some Natlan fruits, it can unleash explosive projectiles, making it a reliable force in both combat and exploration.</p><p><strong>4.4 Koholasaurus</strong></p><p>Koholasaurus shares the hot springs and flowing waters of joy and relaxation with the People of the Springs.

Spoiler: there’s a lot of Doctor Doom.</p><p>As already shown, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24217825/fortnites-next-marvel-collab-will-be-nothing-less-than-fabulous">Absolute Doom battle pass</a> will feature various heroes and villains you can obtain like War Machine, Gwenpool, and, of course, Doctor Doom himself. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209499/marvel-robert-downey-jr-doomsday-russo-bros-salaries">Timely!</a>) But the battle royale island will also have Doom-themed locations you can visit like the town of Doomstadt and Castle Doom, where you can find Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets to use as weapons. Doom’s gauntlets aren’t the only Marvel-themed weapons available, though; you’ll also be able to find Captain America’s shield, which is making a return from an <em>Endgame</em>-themed mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515617/fortnite-avengers-endgame-limited-time-mode-thanos-infinity-stones-mythic-item">from 2019</a>.</p><p>This is actually <em>Fortnite’s</em> <em>second</em> Marvel-themed season; the previous, which launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man">in August 2020</a>, featured characters like Iron Man, Storm, and another version of Doctor Doom in its battle pass. If you didn’t get the outfits in that battle pass, Epic won’t offer them again, but thankfully, Epic is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215375/fortnite-battle-pass-rewards-back-around-item-shop">changing that policy</a> starting with the pass for Absolute Doom.</p><p>There are also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24218732/honey-wheres-my-fortnite-suit">more Disney crossovers coming to <em>Fortnite</em></a><em>, </em>including three Disney villains and characters from <em>The Incredibles</em>. Given that Disney recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">invested $1.5 billion into Epic Games</a>, I suspect we’ll see a bunch more Disney cameos on the battle royale island at some point — and there’s a whole Disney-themed universe inside <em>Fortnite </em>on the way as well<em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But, for the moment, we're stuck in limbo with Fortnite offline while Epic Games deploys the season update. This is standard procedure--we get at least a few hours of downtime before each new season. It's just a matter of time now.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite x Fall Guys Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Chapter 5 Season 4 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in a new Marvel season--its first since 2020--complete with a battle pass full of Marvel icons, new map locations based on the comic book titan's decades of lore, and lots of new weapons.</p><p>But when will that be? Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 4 AM and 7 AM PT / 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, August 16--though there have been some exceptions in the past, usually tied to when a patch takes longer to deploy than Epic anticipated. Still, if all things go smoothly, like they <em>usually</em> do, it'll be on in the early to late morning for US players, or a bit later in the day overseas.</p><p>However, because last season saw some technical difficulties during the patch deployment, <strong>this season's downtime has started earlier than usual</strong>. Thast could mean the new season also launches sooner too. If that's the case, Fortnite may be back online as early as 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.</p><p>Once the game does return, Season 4 will introduce a whole host of changes to the battle royale island, thanks to the Doctor Doom's arrival. Players should expect new bosses, plenty of new weapons, and more secrets to be discovered, both on launch day and throughout the season. Presumably, Chapter 5 Season 4 will also play host to Fortnitemares, the game's annual Halloween event. Last year, horror icon Michael Myers came to the game, and the year before, it saw Ash from Evil Dead debut. Should we expect another horror legend to arrive? It seems like a safe bet.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 on GameSpot.</p>

The date of the cease and desists arrival almost exactly coincides with H2M’s August 16 release date, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBEmMPxuRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced</u></a> last Friday. Its X account’s biography now only says “SHUTDOWN.”</p><p>“Today, our team members received a Cease &amp; Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project,” the team’s last post says. “We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/03/31/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-remastered---screen-2-1585677001593.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer revival mod H2M has been canceled.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The H2M team’s posts date as far back as July 2023 when they <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1675434407560368128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced the project</u></a>, noting that they had already been working on a Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer remastered mod for a while. At the time, the team said, “If Activision won’t do what the fans want, we the community will.” Although the Call of Duty publisher did remaster the original Modern Warfare 2 campaign and release it in 2020, it never went as far as to remaster its multiplayer component.</p><p>H2M aimed to fill the hole with not only upgraded visuals for maps, weapons, and characters fans have loved for more than a decade but also new content, too. It meant new gun camos and animations as well as a crate of new maps based on iconic Call of Duty locations and more. This blend of old and new driven from the perspective of fans had players excited enough to drive sales of Modern Warfare Remastered seeing as the game was needed to play H2M. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/393080/charts/#3m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>, the 2017 title saw a sharp increase in player count in the last few weeks and even managed to climb Steam’s top selling list (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-4-is-one-of-the-best-selling-steam-games-right-now-but-only-because-you-need-it-to-play-an-ambitious-modern-warfare-2-multiplayer-mod-launching-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a>).</p><p>Now, however, Modern Warfare Remastered’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/393080/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_Remastered_2017/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recent Steam reviews</u></a> read “Mostly Negative,” with many recent comments from players calling for Activision to reverse their cease and desist request. Call of Duty fans in general have taken to social media to express their sadness at H2M’s demise, with some prominent content creators asking for Activision to reconsider, too.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are begging that you guys reconsider this decision <a href="https://twitter.com/Activision?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Activision</a>.

Some of the most notable are Beamdog Studio's enhanced edition re-releases of classics like Planescape: Torment and Neverwinter Nights, and Owlcat's recent Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader--and thanks to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fbeamdog-owlcat-rpg-masters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-crpg-bundle-has-baldurs-gate-warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-and-5-more-games-for-35%2F1100-6525842%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new Humble Bundle deal</a>, you can grab PC versions of some of the best CRPGs from both studios for cheap.

Both games are often cited as two of the best 90s CRPGs--Planescape: Torment features incredible writing, dialog, and a unique dark fantasy setting unlike most other RPGs, while Icewind Dale focuses on combat and dungeon crawling. You also get a Humble Store coupon code for <strong>85% off Mythforce</strong>, which is a first-person co-op dungeon crawler inspired by hero shooters and classic 90s fantasy and cartoons. With the coupon, you can pick up Mythforce for just $5.25 (normally $30).</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $7, you get the aforementioned games as well as the enhanced edition remasters of <strong>Baldur's Gate I</strong> <strong>and II</strong>--which update the Bioware originals with new UI and graphics options, quality of life tweaks, and even controller support--and Owlcat's <strong>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Enhanced Plus Edition</strong>, which is based on the popular Pathfinder TTRPG rules and setting, and mixes classic CRPG gameplay with city building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351014"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The $10 tier adds two more games: <strong>Neverwinter Nights: Complete Adventures Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</strong>. And if you pay $15, you get the DLC season passes for Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, for $35, you get all of the previous content plus Owlcat's latest game, <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</strong>. As the name implies, the game is set in the grim sci-fi universe of Warhammer 40,000, but rather than yet another Space Marine-focused adventure, it pulls inspiration from the lesser-known Rogue Trader TTRPG where players explore 40K's violent universe as the leader of a ragtag band of mercenaries.</p><p dir="ltr">The full $35 bundle equates to a $346 value, but whichever tier you opt for, you'll be adding some of the best CRPGs to your Steam library.

Like all Humble Bundle deals, a portion of all sales goes to charity--in this case, the Girls Make Game Scholarship Fund.</p><p dir="ltr">This bundle contains hundreds of hours worth of RPG content, but fans of classic computer-style RPGs still have plenty more to look forward to.

            <title><![CDATA[Madden NFL 25 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/madden-nfl-25-review-in-progress.954663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If football is a game of inches, then Madden typically manages to perfectly recapture that feeling in the minutiae of its year-to-year iterations. Every August, fans sit around and obsessively try to figure out what has changed, if the under-the-hood adjustments actually matter, if the new systems do what EA says they do, and if things truly feel any better. <em>Usually</em>, that is. Not this year. I haven’t played enough of Madden NFL 25 to render a final verdict just yet, but I can already tell that things feel very different than they do in Madden NFL 24 – and I don’t need to bring out the chains to see that good progress has been made. </p><p>EA has been hyping up Madden 25’s updated looks, and honestly, that’s where its improvements are most immediately clear. The menus are much cleaner – your options are big, clearly delineated, and easy to understand, and, miraculously, largely lag-free. This may not seem like a big deal, but if you played Madden 24 at launch, it feels like mana from heaven. It truly is the little things. My wife, who specializes in UX design and has watched me play entirely too much Madden 24 over the last year, walked by while I was playing this year’s iteration and casually remarked that “this looks like an actual menu designed by an actual person.” Hallelujah, brothers and sisters. They heard us.</p><p>All right, Will. Yeah, new menus. Big whoop. Tell us about something more substantial than that. Well, dear reader, the major modes benefit from this new focus on presentation, too, and I feel like a lot of what’s good here can be traced directly back to the improvements we saw in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">College Football 25</a>. In Franchise mode, you can finally create female coaches, and there are more customization options than ever before in terms of heads and apparel. There are still only ten head options for women compared to forty for men, but it’s cool that they’ve been added at all.</p><p>Superstar also benefits from this new coat of paint, despite ditching the pretense of an opening storyline (and based on what I’ve seen, voice acting) entirely, which is a shame. The upside is that once you complete the Combine, things get better. The draft actually looks and feels like the NFL draft. When the almighty Joe Throw got drafted by the Falcons 8th overall, Roger Goodell, the most hated man in football, came out and hugged him before presenting him with a Falcons jersey and posing for a picture — just like in real life. Did Joe look like some hideous golem animated by black magic compared to the mute, wax figure of Madden 25’s Roger Goodell? Yes. Does that matter? Not really. It still looks a hell of a lot better than what we had, and I appreciated all of the additional customization options I was given when recreating Joe Throw in Madden 25 — another thing this year’s Madden feels like it owes in part to College Football 25.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The draft actually looks and feels like the NFL draft this year.</p></div><p>Once I was in the Falcons facility, I walked around with head coach Raheem Morris and we discussed my goals for the preseason. Again, it’s a little weird to see everyone’s mouths move and have no sound come out, but graphically? Way better than last year, and I appreciated the moment-to-moment visual updates, whether I was chatting with my teammates in the locker room or out on the field. No longer are we trapped in hotel rooms.</p><p>Speaking of the field, there’s some neat stuff to see here, too. Things just look better all around, whether it’s character models, animations before, during, and after plays, or the new and improved touchdown graphics that pull up the scoring player’s photo. Again, it’s the little things.</p><p>Not everything’s a home run here, however; I hate the new play arts, at least the ones we see in the playbook. They’re harder to parse than the ones in Madden 24 and, conveniently, look just like the ones in College Football 25. They can’t all be zingers, I guess, but man, these can’t be replaced fast enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are also a lot of big changes, like the new kickoff rules, which feel… really weird. I don’t think I like them, but that’s an NFL problem, not necessarily a Madden problem. Either way, it will take a while to get used to. Other things are more positive. I love being able to choose coverage shells rather than just appearing in base align, and I’m a big fan of being able to shift both sides of my O-line independently of one another… yet another feature we first saw in College Football 25. It might just be me, but Madden 25 even feels closer to College Football 25 in terms of speed – maybe I’m crazy, but if that actually proves to be a thing as I play more, I like the direction things are headed.</p><p>I also like that there are more mini-games to play, and that there are finally mini-games for O-linemen you can use to Focus Train them in Franchise mode. I don’t particularly <em>enjoy </em>these mini-games, admittedly, but at least they’re there and I can use them – and overall the mini-games here are hands down an improvement over Madden 24. Getting messages from my GM when I’m playing as a coach in my Franchise is also a nice touch, and I’m a big fan of the new commentary teams, particularly Kate Scott and Brock Huard. (Say it with me: it’s the little things.) </p><p>I have a lot of Madden NFL 25 left to play before I’m ready to give it a score. I have a Franchise to run, more Superstars to guide to Lombardi glory, my yearly slog in the EA Money Machine that is Ultimate Team, and so on. But I find myself… optimistic? Is that even a thing you’re allowed to be about Madden? Maybe I’m totally off base, and I’ll notice more issues the more I play. Football’s a game of inches, after all, and the smallest mistakes can lead to disaster. But right now, man, those little things? They’re feelin’ pretty good.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Modern Warfare 3 portion of the Esports World Cup is heating up, and earlier today, a round of Challengers-level teams proved that they’re worth more than some CDL competitors. First up was Gentle Mates, which forcefully ejected G2 Esports (Minnesota Rokkr) from the event with a 3-2 win in the elimination round.</p>



<p>Then, Stallions (FC Black) booted Team Heretics out of the competition with a crushing blow. In that series, it came down to the wire on every map, with the opening Hardpoint being almost too close to call at 250 – 248.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shaping-up">Shaping Up</h2>



<p>Modern Warfare 3 isn’t performing all that well at the Esports World Cup, given how many fans of the Call of Duty League have labelled it a ‘fake event’. As an example, the elimination match between Team Falcons and Lore Gaming secured an average peak viewer count floating around 4,500.</p>



<p>Plenty have claimed it’s just to secure a bag, and in many ways, that’s true. There are stacks of cash on the line, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Even teams leaving the tournament without a single win go away with $20,000 in their pockets.</p>



<p>Following the first round of elimination matches, the first four teams to be ejected from the tournament have bowed out:</p>



<ul>
<li>OMiT</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Heretics</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>Tomorrow, we’ll see teams starting to flesh out the playoff roster, and the expectation is that it’ll be populated entirely by CDL squads. Only eight can make it that far, and presently, it looks like it’ll be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Cloud9</li>



<li>OpTic Gaming</li>



<li>100 Thieves</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Boston Breach</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s easy to believe in the underdog spirit in the Call of Duty world, so we could still see the likes of Gentle Mates, Stallions, or Lore Gaming make it into the playoffs.</p>



<p>Who do you have winning the MW3 category at the Esports World Cup?</p>

<p>You can now play the original <em>Diablo</em> (and its expansion, <em>Hellfire</em>) in virtually any web browser on any computer with generally excellent performance and operating-as-expected controls. It's all thanks to an open source project published on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb">Diabloweb</a> that's now being <a href="https://x.com/iequalshane/status/1823357647673868408">circulated</a> by game developers on X.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> in the project's GitHub repository, the project's developer (d07RiV) notes that it is based on <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX">DevilutionX</a>, another open source project that did a lot of legwork to make <em>Diablo</em> run well on modern operating systems.</p>
<p>"I've modified the code to remove all dependencies and exposed the minimal required interface with JS, allowing the game to be compiled into WebAssembly," writes d07RiV. "Event handling (especially in the menus) had to be modified significantly to fit the JS model."
</p><p>It's pretty easy to set up; you just <a href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/">visit the website</a>, upload a file, and get going.</p>
<p>You have to upload a file because the project doesn't include the <em>Diablo</em> game files—you'll have to provide those in the form of the DIABDAT.MPQ file in the <em>Diablo</em> install directory.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>There are three above-board ways to source this MPQ file. First, you can, of course, own a physical copy of the original game. Alternatively, you can purchase the game <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo">on GOG</a> and install it, then pull the file from the installation directory.</p>
<p>There's also a shareware release of <em>Diablo,</em> and you can pull the SPAWN.MPQ file from that, and it works just fine. That's not the full game, though, so that's more for if you just want to try it.</p>

<p>I played the game for about half an hour using the MPQ from the GOG version without any issues on Firefox on a Mac. (There's no Mac version of the GOG installer, though, so I had to run the installer in a virtual Windows machine to get at the file.) The game is obviously primitive compared to more recent entries in the series (or even <em>Diablo II</em>), but it is an addictive blast to play regardless.</p>

<p>Here at Ars, we're always on the lookout for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">hints</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">actions</a> that suggest the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">long</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/half-life-2-episode-3-may-not-see-release-until-2010/">long wait</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/valves-newell-explains-continuing-silence-on-next-half-life/"><em>Half-Life 3</em></a> may eventually come to an end. So when users across the Internet started making note of the mysterious and intriguingly named <a href="https://blackmesa.com/">BlackMesa.com</a> recently, our ears perked up for signs of a new promotional <a href="https://arstechnica.com/technopaedia/2008/05/alternate-reality-game/">alternate reality game</a> (ARG).
</p><p>Alas, this seems like yet another false alarm. BlackMesa.com is simply the website for Black Mesa, which <a href="https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades">confirmed in a public statement</a> that it is "actually a real company in the Boston area... working hard to assure and secure vaccine and other biological manufacturing production."</p>

<p>— PеQu (@ImPeQu) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1821916164357771630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The BlackMesa.com domain name dates back to at least 2006, when the address was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061014211724/http://www.blackmesa.com/">filled with search engine optimization ads by an outfit called MDNH, Inc</a>. But in 2022, a page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331041630/http://www.blackmesa.com/">advertising the domain's availability for purchase</a> was suddenly replaced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220911192743/https://www.blackmesa.com/">a mysterious logo</a> that bears a striking resemblance to <a>the fictional Black Mesa logo</a> in the games. And then there's the hard-to-read cipher at the bottom, the kind of thing that an ARG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/the-only-thing-more-intricate-than-mr-robots-plot-its-real-world-puzzle/">might use to hide important information in plain sight</a>.
</p><p>The site stayed like that, to little wider notice or suspicion, until August 8, when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1eo3ddx/black_mesa_now_has_its_own_website_featuring_a/">Valve fans</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1eoagpo/what_we_know_so_far_valve_leaks_black_mesa_web/">social media</a> began to <a href="https://twitter.com/HL_Alyx_NoVR/status/1821870694927606026">"[wake] up to a Black Mesa website"</a> that had suddenly been updated with a new header declaring, "Science requires process. Our insight defends it." Others on social media were <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886779693166989">quick to note the old cipher text</a> as a well as <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886790598369404">a new, obfuscated JavaScript countdown function</a> with <a href="https://x.com/ImPeQu/status/1821930270586499121">the internal name "Lambda Incident"</a>. That countdown seemed to be pointing toward <em>something</em> happening on September 30, which seems like as good a time as any to announce <em>Half-Life 3</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1821916164357771630">right</a>?</p>

<p>The Valve faithful hoping this was a new version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/why-complaints-about-valves-portal-2-arg-miss-the-point/">the old <em>Portal 2</em> Potato ARG</a> had their hopes quickly dashed, though. Internet sleuths soon found a digital paper trail for Charles Fracchia, a research scientist who is <a href="https://fas.org/expert/charles-fracchia/">listed</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/%3Ca%20href=">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.isac.bio/charles">elsewhere</a> as the founder of "Black Mesa, a stealth company developing technologies that create provable assurance for advanced manufacturing workflows" since back in 2022. And by last Friday, the Black Mesa team <a href="https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades">put up a blog post</a> quashing any game-related rumors that might be circulating.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"As much as we would be honored to be part of any Valve game—we do not work in this sector at all," the blog post reads. "We are not secretly working on <em>Half-Life 3</em>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1ek5yw9/valve_is_currently_developing_a_new_game/">Project White Sands</a> (whatever that is/may be) or any other Valve title—we're just nerds working to secure the global bioeconomy." </p>
<p>The team went on to thank the Half-Life community that had sent in "a ton of messages of support and curiosity" about the company, as well as "thousands of fake inquiries" that "made us laugh." As for that old ciphertext? Turns out solving it <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886785795887461">simply unlocked a recruitment message</a> seeking "engineers, cybersecurity professionals, and biologists" for the company. "KingPotatoVII please reach out, we've been trying to send you some swag for cracking the cipher a while back," the Black Mesa team wrote with a smiley face emoji.</p>

<p>Despite the revelation of the <em>real</em> Black Mesa corporation, some hangers-on haven't quite given up hope that this is all still just an extremely subtle bit of stealth marketing. "What if [actual scientist Charles Fraschia] is such a huge fan of <em>Half-Life</em>, like us, and decided to use his image/likeness to do this ARG for the game?" one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ent51e/what_if_this_charles_fracchia_guy_is_an_actual/">wrote last week</a>. "Maybe he reached out and absolutely went full madlad with Valve to make this a magnum opus of an ARG. ... Could be simply someone is heavy trolling us, and to be honest I’m not even mad because this is fun af!"</p>
<p>Keep hope alive, Valve faithful! <em>Half-Life 3</em> is obviously just around the corner, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/half-life-3-is-not-in-the-works-says-valve-voice-actor/">no matter what anyone says</a>! The truth is out there for those with eyes to see it!

            <p>
Call of Duty has become an absolute hard drive hog in recent years, with 2023's entry managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">consume over 200GB of storage</a> in some cases. That all might be about to change, however, as Activision has announced major changes to the way it'll be handing installs with this year's Black Ops 6, promising "smaller and more customised downloads" as a result.
</p>
<p>
Activision shared the news in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap">post on its Call of Duty blog</a>, explaining its optimisation work will begin with a revamp of "the experience formerly known as Call of Duty HQ". This revamp is set to roll out over the course of several updates ahead of Black Ops 6's October launch, and will promises to introduce a streamlined interface, direct access to games, more control over downloads, and expanded texture streaming technology to reduce file sizes.
</p>
<p>
A first update to reorganise game content arrives on 21st August. Then, following Black Ops 6's open beta on 30th August, a new user interface and other "remaining updates" are scheduled for mid-October. After these "larger initial updates", Activision says future Call of Duty downloads will decrease in size and existing files will take up less space on players' device.

<p>
Key to these plans is the decision to decouple Call of Duty: Warzone from other titles, meaning it'll no longer be installed by default. Instead, whenever players purchase an annual Call of Duty title, they'll only be required to install its files - but they can "opt in" to a Warzone install during that process, or download it separately at a future point.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, players will have new options where Call of Duty's expanded texture streaming tech is concerned. Activision says its new capabilities mean it can "cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage". And once the tech is introduced, players can choose between Optimised streaming, which supplies high-fidelity graphical quality at the expense of higher internet bandwidth usage, or minimal streaming, which reduces graphical quality and bandwidth requirements.
</p>
<p>
Activision says the first update players will need to download as part of these changes is a "big one", but will ultimately see Call of Duty's footprint decrease due to its file optimisations. The publisher also notes this initial update will arrive for PlayStation 5 players across four separate downloads "due to differences in file organisation". There's more detail in Activision's blog, but the takeaway is a simple one. "As a result of these updates," the company writes, "Black Ops 6 will be a smaller download at launch than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">certain tiers of Game Pass</a> on 25th October. And if you're curious about this year's Zombies mode, developer Treyarch has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-shows-off-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-terminus-island-zombies-map-in-new-trailer">sharing initial details</a> over the last few weeks.

            <p>Life sim contender Inzoi is hoping to knock The Sims from its perch when it launches (supposedly) later this year. There will soon be an opportunity to judge whether that feat is likely. Krafton have announced that they're releasing a time-limited trial of Inzoi's character creator next week on August 20th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Inzoi: Character Studio will launch Tuesday, August 20th at 5am BST/9pm PT <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">via Steam</a> and will be available to play with until the same time on Monday, August 26th.
</p>
<p>Here's a trailer for the character creator:

<p>Yes, the characters are called zois.
</p>
<p>I like a good character creator, although I admit several MMOs have rendered me somewhat immune to the charms of Inzoi's particular art style in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-desert-closed-beta">the years since Black Desert Online</a>. I have other reasons to be interested in Inzoi though, including its driveable cars, editable city, and planned mod support at launch. If the character creator is the first thing I can play with, I'll take it.
</p>
<p>There's definitely space for a Sims competitor, both in my heart and in the marketplace at large. The Sims 4 is getting long in the tooth, long enough that EA are apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">working on their own sorta successor, Project Rene</a>. Life By You, Paradox's swing at the genre, ended in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">11th hour cancellation</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paralives">Paralives</a> is promising and ambitious, but who knows if its small indie team can deliver or hit its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paralives-heats-up-the-race-to-be-the-next-sims-with-early-access-release-in-2025-confirms-no-paid-dlc">2025 Early Access release target</a>.
</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">plenty more screenshots of the Inzoi character creator over on that Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, the project is not coming anytime soon, as Meta has officially confirmed that it has been put "on hold indefinitely." </p><p>A Meta spokesperson confirmed to IGN via email that the game has been put "on hold indefinitely." Additionally, the official Meta Quest VR YouTube account responded after users commented on a trailer for an upcoming Meta Quest game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAmNSjF9Big&amp;lc=UgwielXvTo--EHoQY7x4AaABAg.A77ZzS0z8DOA7A-RrmuyA-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behemoth</a>, developed by Skydance Games. "GTA: San Andreas is on hold indefinitely while we both focus on other projects," Meta Quest VR's official YouTube account confirmed in the comments. "We look forward to working with our friends at Rockstar in the future."</p><p>GTA San Andreas VR was announced during Facebook Connect in October 2021. No gameplay footage or a release window was shown during the event. In <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/games-at-connect-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post highlighting games presented at the event</a>, Meta described GTA San Andreas VR as "a project many years in the making." </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/249154303-932851327587816-8092379224022713379-n-1723752133658.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A VR version of GTA San Andreas was announced at Facebook Connect in October 2021. | Image Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure></output><p>GTA San Andreas VR would not be the first time that Meta has provided a VR remake to a game, as the company previously worked with Armature Studio and Capcom to bring <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-vr-review">the original Resident Evil 4</a> to Meta Quest headsets. Additionally, GTA San Andreas VR would have been the second VR project Rockstar Games has worked on following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/10/la-noire-the-vr-case-files-review">L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files</a>, which was initially released in 2017 for the HTC Vive, before making its way onto Oculurs Rift headsets and PSVR in 2018 and 2019, respectively.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was originally released in 2004 for the PS2. Set in the early 1990s in the fictional southern California city of San Andreas, players control Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns to his old neighborhood to investigate the murder of his mother.</p><p>GTA San Andreas' indefinite delay comes as Meta is losing billions of dollars in the VR gaming market. In a new report published by <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-reality-check-inside-the-45-billion-cash-burn-at-reality-labs-125717347.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAuYXNhbmEuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJ2-yLyT2kZsC1i38JfWfcZ2-TdM8wR_rQdpb7__4JAEvWSHiteqb-wF46QOWhBhTHJA6fFQpkfjXanbXUUddfTBtiL-SY1N0quuVVAcgN3GZbV94zikYLiiuvryFSGXEZ-p6_iLQwWkIqhTYQsN2srNURy0sZQq9Fxxw4VdIO3q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Finance earlier this month</a>, the outlet said that the Reality Labs division was burning through money, with $16 billion in losses accrued from the VR-centric division in 2023 alone. </p><p>IGN has reached out to Take-Two Interactive for comment.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

Now available to preorder for $35 at Amazon ahead of its September 17 release date, this arcane cookbook contains over 60 recipes as well as accompanying details, illustrations, and photographs. It sounds like a lovely book, and if it's as awesome as the first Elder Scrolls cookbook, it could be quite popular. It also includes a travelogue with background details about the origin of each dish, exclusive illustrations, and original photography.</p><p>The hardcover book is a sequel to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Official-Cookbook/dp/1683833988?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>wildly </em>popular 2019 Elder Scrolls cookbook</a>. Volume I wasn't just "popular for a gaming cookbook" either; it has more customer reviews on Amazon than possibly any other gaming book. It has garnered over 13,000 Amazon reviews with a 4.9/5-star average. Absurd. If you spend some time looking at gaming books on Amazon--art books, encyclopedias, cookbooks, etc.--you will quickly notice that the vast majority of titles come nowhere close to those numbers.

		<p>Vertigo Games is returning to their first big VR hit, announcing Arizona Sunshine Remake for Meta Quest 2 and 3, PSVR 2 and PC VR. The remake is coming out on 17th October, with pre-orders now live and a discounted upgrade price for owners of the original game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arizona Sunshine Remake | Reveal Trailer | Meta Quest 2+3, PS VR2, Steam VR [ESRB]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Svid78o9GJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the biggest games from the early days of virtual reality gaming, Arizona Sunshine is now the better part of a decade old, and in danger of being left behind on current VR platforms. Sure, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">a sequel that launched late last year</a>, but the original game was predominantly a PC VR game for early headsets, and then with ports to the original PSVR and Meta Quest.</p>
<p>The remake will be able to take advantage of the current crop of headsets, being built from the ground-up with an enhanced graphics engine to better utilise Quest 2 and 3, bring the game to PSVR 2 for the first time, and raise the limit of what PC VR can accomplish. There’s also improved VR combat and weapons, and a new mutilation and gore system.</p>


<p>Arizona Sunshine Remake will feature everything that was made for the first game, so there’s all the original DLC and updates bundled in – Dead Man DLC, The Damned DLC, Old Mine update, Trailer Park Update and the Undead Valley Update – and full support for four-player co-op in campaign and the horde mode.</p>
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/27/arizona-sunshine-playstation-vr-review/">Arizona Sunshine review,</a> Jim said, “If you’re serious about PlayStation VR and love first person shooters, Arizona Sunshine is a no-brainer. Mowing down mobs of the undead is immensely satisfying with a great spread of weapons and plenty of opportunities to have some fun. The campaign is well-paced, supplying small but welcome diversions to break up the action with little morsels of story here and there. At £33, some players will naturally want more bang for their buck, but the quality of content on offer here is fantastic. With the bar set even higher than before, it will be interesting to watch how developers try to emulate and improve upon Arizona Sunshine.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-helps-new-players-start<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in June, Wizards of the Coast announced the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-set-helps-bring-new-and-old-players-together" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Foundations</a>. It is a set designed to invite new players into the ubiquitous card game and bring back older cards beloved by series veterans. To that end, the publisher has announced new details on their upcoming Magic: The Gathering Foundations Beginner Box.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamingtrend.com/news/peak-inside-the-foundations-beginner-box-for-magic-the-gathering/">Gaming Trend</a>, the <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box will feature two Jumpstart half decks. This is to help teach new players the basics of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and give them some hands-on experience with building a deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-cat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=Z8zkinxN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-cat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=_dzjyja5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The two half decks previewed in one of the <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box are themed around cats and vampires. The cat deck is mono white. The vampire deck is mono black. Alongside these two 20-card decks is a step-by-step guide booklet which will walk players through their first five turns.</p>
<p>Once this guided play tutorial is done, the box will provide players the means to express themselves. Alongside the two half decks are eight Jumpstart packets. Players can open two packets each, mix and match different themes, and build a full 40-card deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-vampire-card-artwork.jpg?itok=TDyBU1Vr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-vampire-card-artwork.jpg?itok=xVRcYwvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box will contain the following:</p>
<ul><li>Two themed 20-card half decks</li>
<li>A tutorial guide booklet</li>
<li>Eight Jumpstart packets</li>
<li>Two playmats designed to show new players a standard game's layout</li>
<li>Two spindown dice to track life totals</li>
<li>A rules reference booklet</li>
</ul><p>There is some grounds for speculation on what other themes will be explored in other beginner boxes. Magic: The Gathering has been around for 30 years and has a rich history of creatures, characters, and settings. All of which can hook players in if presented in approachable package.</p>
<p><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will be available worldwide November 15.</p>

            <p>I am forever looking for a game to replace Transport Tycoon (or OpenTTD) in my affections. I know there are several railway management sims kicking around Steam, but I haven't found the one that does it for me yet. Could it be Railroad Corporation 2? It's a train tycoon game in which you lay tracks through the early 20th century, and it's launching in Early Access on September 9th.

<p>If you've ever played any of these games, you know what do. You build a choo-choo empire as you lay tracks, buy trains, hire staff, and seek to effeciently transport goods between various towns and trade depots. Railroad Corporation 2 then adds an extra wrinkle with its turn-of-the-century setting, in which you must continue to upgrade your stock to stay ahead of your competition as electrification revolutionises the railway.
</p>
<p>Expansion means more than just laying more tracks in front of your moving train, but also growing the cities you're ferrying goods between by building factories, hospitals, banks, and power plants to supply your infrastructure.
</p>
<p>There's not a lot of detail about its planned Early Access journey on its Steam page, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677970/view/6892282513992386794">the announcement</a> does say it'll be polished and expanded "over the course of the year". At launch it'll include four campaign missions, and online multiplayer with up to four players in either co-op or versus modes.
</p>
<p>I confess, the first Railroad Corporation passed me by in 2019, but it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/797400/Railroad_Corporation/">respectable rating from user reviews on Steam</a>. Hopefully the sequel doesn't need bricking up in a tunnel like a naughty engine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-plucky-squire">The Plucky Squire</a> stars a 2D sword-slashing protagonist <em>so</em> plucky he busts out of his storybook confines and into the fully 3D world of a kid's bedroom. You'll then spend your time hopping between these various planes on a grand, cartoon adventure.
</p>
<p>It now has a release date: September 17th.

<p>Plucky Squire is from Jonathan Biddle, one of the makers of 2018's Sword Of Ditto, a game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-swords-of-ditto-review">many splendid ideas but mixed execution</a>. Sounds like the perfect person to get a second swing at something. This time, Biddle has co-founded new studio All Possible Futures with former Game Freak artist James Turner and they're partnered again with Ditto publisher Devolver Digital.
</p>
<p>Plucky Squire also made it onto our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">most anticipated games of 2024</a>. 
</p>
<p>I think you can look at the trailer above and go, cor, yeah, that'll be anticipated because of the art, the animation, the energy and all that, but no. I think it's because it's coherent. A 2D guy who pops into a 3D world? Seen it, done it. A <em>storybook</em> guy who pops into the world external to the book? That's ludonarrative cohesion, bud, and we games journalists can't get enough of it. We'll slash some Zelda enemies with a sword until we're dusty skeletons if it's hung inside some sort of clever-clever context.
</p>
<p>What's that? You think I'm <em>already</em> a dusty skeleton? No argument here. I hope The Plucky Squire is as joyful to play as it is to look at when it launches in a month's time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
