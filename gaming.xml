            <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-writers-new-dark-fantasy-vania-also-features-vampires-plus-screaming-spiders">first wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> in January, I worried I might have spotlighted a dud. Or at least, something fairly routine. Mandragora sure does look like a lot of dark fantasy side-scrollers - gritty yet plump and colourful, like they stuck a bike pump in Castlevania, or took a chisel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trine">Trine</a>. It sure does have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> classes and skilltrees. It sure does have crafting, with hundreds of items to acquire. </p>
<p>I confess, I covered it in large part because they have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> writer Brian Mitsoda on the ticket. But then I read the comments on that piece, weeks later, and there were a few lost souls raving about playing the demo for hours. Mandragora launches today. I've now spent an hour or two with a full build myself, and yeah, this feels like the good stuff.</p><!--more-->

<p>The key opening draw is that for all the emphasis in certain trailers on systems and craftables, Mandragora seems very story-led. It takes place in an apocalyptic world where a sepulchral King Priest holds sway over the Crimson City, promising to keep the nightspawn at bay. The King Priest looks a bit like Judge Claude Frollo from Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame, and shares Frollo's enthusiasm for torturing witches.</p>
<p>You play a Crimson City inquisitor who intervenes to mercy-kill one of said tortured witches, saturating yourself with a mysterious power in the process. Seeking to save face, the King Priest anoints you as one of god's chosen, and sends you forth to track down another witch. Meanwhile, a voice starts whispering in your head. </p>
<p>The opening tutorial sections are filled with sturdily voiced NPC chit-chats that thicken the setting like delicious fistfuls of cornstarch. The character portraits twitch and glare like possessed oil paintings - some of the commenters on my last piece found them off-putting, but for me, they're the best thing about Mandragora's visual direction so far. Hurrying through the Crimson City, you bandy words with some fellow inquisitors and pick up the rudiments of dodge-rolling. Then it's off to the woods to rescue a blacksmith and bother some massive wolves.</p>
<p>As an action-RPG, Mandragora appears to have plenty going on, striking a balance between the lean feel of classic Castlevania and the unlocks fusillade of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.  You've got a primary weapon and an auxiliary such as a spell or shield, a jump, a ledge-grab and a spread of gear slots. The combat goes heavy on stamina management and evasion, with the promise of stirring abilities and passives together into bespoke methods of monster-murderment.</p>
<p>The animations and controls are a bit halting, but it all seems engrossing enough. Still, I'm more interested in the gently labyrinthine levels, which are woven around Dark Soulsy altars where you can fast travel and level up, and are nicely abundant in secretive high platforms and concealed entrances.</p>
<p>Again, though, what grabs me upfront is the centrality of the story and writing. Even at its gamiest, Mandragora appears to be going for a certain consistency. There's a tutorial beat early on where you smash some crates and the merchant who owns those crates cusses you out, only to realise that you're an Inquisitor and beg for forgiveness. I like a game that knows how to turn an everyday Crash Bandicootism into characterisation. I'll hopefully have more thoughts down the road (Mandragora is an estimated 40+ hours in length). In the meantime, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">here's the Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But today’s mini <em>Mario Kart</em> Direct confirmed for me that I’m most interested in the Free Roam mode. It’s the <em>Burnout Paradise</em> sequel I’ve been waiting for since 2008.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,197298,197284" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502">the Switch 2 Direct</a></span> earlier this month first announced that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200?_gl=1*y9caif*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDQ4OTc2NjckbzQkZzEkdDE3NDQ4OTk1NDckajU3JGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200?_gl=1*y9caif*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDQ4OTc2NjckbzQkZzEkdDE3NDQ4OTk1NDckajU3JGwwJGgw">the launch title <em>Mario Kart World</em> will let you drive between the race tracks</a></span> and hinted at an explorable world, I found an immediate greater interest beyond that of “MORE <em>MARIO KART</em>!” The idea of just aimlessly driving around a Nintendo-created world sounds completely brilliant.</p><p>Today’s Direct assured me that my suspicions were correct—that there was no way the developer would be able to resist packing the world with secrets, bonus items, missions to complete, and collectibles to find. And honestly, I find that even more enticing that shaving microseconds off of my best times on my favorite tracks. (OK, admittedly, I’ve not actually lost too many hours in that particular pursuit since an obsession with the N64's Koopa Troopa Beach level.) It reminds me of another gaming obsession: smashing every barrier and smashable billboard in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>.</p><p>Not playing driving games properly is a bit of a habit. And the best driving games are the ones that positively encourage it, like <em>BP</em>, and also the wonderful <em>Forza Horizon</em> games. Sure, there are races and cups and what-have-you, but what if I just drive over there? There might be a windmill! There might be yellow fencing I’ve yet to knock over.</p><p>I return to <em>Burnout Paradise</em> with a concerning frequency, almost never replaying all the races, my enthusiasm focused on smashing my way around Paradise City. It’s a passion strong enough to get past the game’s interminable opening screens and the contemptible babble of Worst Character In All Of Fiction, DJ Atomika. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, albeit without all the barriers to break, is giving me that same drive (sorry) to aimlessly explore.</p><p>The footage shows <em>so</em> much stuff to find out there! All those pads to jump off, blocks to bop, blue P switches to trigger, and then coins and who knows what else. It’s going to be just so much fun to veer away from the races and uncover the secrets. Or just pootle about, nudging at the edges, seeing if I can break the boundaries, and approach the kart racer like a third-person action game.</p><p>It’d be nice if it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">didn’t cost such an absurd amount of money</a></span>, although I’ve been fortunate enough to pre-order the bundled version (the magic of being a foreigner to your shores). I really hate that. I don’t care for any of the half-assed arguments about “worth” and “value”—I just hate that it means the game and all the joy it looks like it could offer will be cut off from so many more people.</p><p>Privileged as I am, I’m now far more hyped for this than I was before, my hopes of an open-world game beyond the racing seemingly validated. And then the racing on top of that, too! It’s fun to be <em>this</em> pumped for the ninth entry in an ongoing franchise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, among the many different scenes was a sneakily silly reference to an infamous moment in Mario history, and it all revolves around a little blue penguin.</p><p dir="ltr">During the Free Roam section of the presentation--at around the 12:04 mark--we see the Penguin racer approaching a cliff and driving off of it, plummeting to the water below. The kart lands safely in the waves, and the little guy cheerfully drives away. This is a far more fortunate fate than old-school Mario fans anticipated back in 1996, when the baby penguin debuted in the Cool, Cool Mountain stage of Super Mario 64.</p>

            <p>
Back when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> was getting properly big, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-princes-carlton-sues-fortnite-for-copying-his-legendary-dance">Carlton from the Fresh Prince famously tried to sue Epic Games</a> for the use of his dance in the game. (You could also buy the Carlton dance in Destiny, I remember, which I absolutely did, but I suppose Fortnite had just become the biggest game on the planet at the time.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Carlton - real name Alfonso Ribeiro - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-dance-litigation-crumbles-as-alfonso-ribeiro-refused-carlton-dance-copyright">was ultimately unsuccessful, as were a handful of other similar cases</a>. But whether because of the bad publicity or actual legal concerns, Fortnite pretty quickly cleaned up its act. Today it's home to countless dance emotes, music tracks and other bits and pieces, all agreed legally and above board.
</p>
<p>
But now, six years on from Carlton vs Fortnite, we have the maker of the Charli XCX Apple dance vs Roblox. The former has alleged that the latter sold their dance without permission, raking in roughly $123k (£93k) in sales. Has no one learned anything over the past half decade?
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, Apple dance creator and copyright holder Kelly Heyer began legal action this week. Heyer originally posted the dance on TikTok last summer, and it was correctly licensed by Fortnite and added to that game last December. 
</p>
<p>
Roblox, according to Heyer, added the emote last August after contacting her to gain permission, but before the permission was actually granted. 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement," Heyer's attorney Miki Anzai said. "Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."
</p>
<p>
Charli XCX herself, by the way, does not seem to be getting involved. The artist has used the dance on tour, but was not part of its creation. 
</p>
<p>
"As the Apple Dance emote comprises solely of the Apple Dance choreography, completely separate and distinct from the Charli XCX song, the sole 'artist' for purposes of the emote is Ms. Heyer," the TikTok creator's lawsuit reads.
</p>
<p>
Responding to the lawsuit, a Roblox spokesperson said the game took "the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform". 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox is confident in its position and the propriety of its dealings in this matter and looks forward to responding in court."
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">parents who were "not comfortable" about their children's safety shouldn't let them play Roblox</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Imperfect Words Of Parasite Eve]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/parasite-eve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-imperfect-words-of-parasite-eve.1166931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parasite-eve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There used to be words to describe this, but they were imperfect. They were abstract ideas, loosely gathered, that served as a way through. Before the words I needed became the words wielded as blades in headlines and discourse, they were something beautiful but weird and alarming. They were <em>Parasite Eve</em>.</p><p>I bought <em>Parasite Eve</em> in September 1998 at a new-and-used video game store in Whitehorse, Yukon. I can’t recall the name of it anymore, but like all things in a small town, I can still picture it through the memory of all the landmarks that led me there: up the street from the SAAN store and the mall that isn’t really a mall, around the corner from the record store that isn’t there anymore, and across the road from the store that sold Hummel figurines of blank-faced children casting forlorn glances at an unseen God and discount copies of the King James Bible.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Parasite Eve</em> was given prominence on the shelf by the pedigree of its publisher Squaresoft (now Square Enix) and was displayed in conversation with its brethren. <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, released by Squaresoft in January of 1997, was the catalyst for sculpting Playstation devotees from children raised by parents who called all video games “Nintendos”. While <em>FF7</em> remained an insistent pleasure, catalogued by my well-worn and dog-eared copy of the official Prima strategy guide, I was hungry for something more as its secrets and mysteries waned.&nbsp;</p><p>A <em>Parasite Eve</em> ad in Electronic Gaming Monthly lingered in my mind: Portraits of two women’s faces, crafted by polygons, with the tagline “the worst foe lies within”. The ad claimed <em>Parasite Eve</em> was “the cinematic RPG” and promised the game would come with a collectors CD containing playable demos of <em>Xenogears, Bushido Blade 2, Brave Fencer Musashi</em>, and, notably<em>, Final Fantasy VIII</em>. I knew little about what <em>Parasite Eve</em> was going to be, but in my mind it was going to be everything, with a free demo of <em>FF8 </em>to boot. I can always be tantalized with the promise of a free taste of my lasting desires.&nbsp;</p><p>Every lunch break from work, I would walk up to the video game store and ask if <em>Parasite Eve </em>was out yet, until the day that it was, and then its secrets were mine to take home and unravel. When I bought it, the guy warned me that it was a Girl Game. “Just wanted to make sure you know”, he said. I said I wanted it mostly for the <em>FF8</em> demo, and left quickly with my lies in tow. I finished the rest of the workday, sped home, burrowed into the basement where the good TV sat alone in the dark, snapped the first disc into the flimsy Playstation spindle, and went to the Opera.&nbsp;</p><p>RPGs were still a new sensation for me, and while their meandering opening minutes are familiar to me now, at the time it felt like a challenge. In the opening of <em>FF7</em>, Cloud Strife leaps from the roof of a moving train to fight a whole mess of nameless Shinra guys, but in <em>Parasite Eve</em>, protagonist Aya Brea opens her story tepidly, reluctantly taking a dud on a pity date to opening night at Carnegie Hall.&nbsp;</p><p>My desire to keep going wavered at this moment, the clerk claiming this was a Girl Game taunting my heart. I was already struggling to weave the tender threads of my identity into some perfect tapestry of masculinity; I was afraid of being perceived by anyone, including myself, as anything other than status quo. I had questions about myself that had no clear answer: No words to describe how I felt at odds with my body, how I desired a change that I could not name or seek out. All this worry, all the careful upkeep of a lie, piled on and ran slipshod through the hallways of my anxious mind when Eve, <em>Parasite Eve</em>’s antagonist, emerged on stage piloting the body of a struggling New York actress and set the theatre on fire.</p><p>I had to know more. The ad in EGM had promised a cinematic RPG and here it was coming true, seamlessly moving between otherworldly cutscenes and action I was able to control. Given free rein of Aya Brea’s movement, albeit with the clunky tank controls <em>Resident Evil </em>was just beginning to popularize. Aya rushed the stage, and for the first time in a video game I questioned the outfit choices of my avatar. I wondered how she could run in the heels she wore with her black cocktail dress, where she had stashed the gun she pulled on Eve. I wanted to know where Aya kept her secret things, and how she managed to pull it all together with ease.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I wanted words to describe the secrets of my body. A framework to develop a skeleton upon which to lay sinew and skin, to run blood that felt like my own through my veins. Cloud’s brief dalliance with crossing the boundaries of gender at the Honey Bee Inn in <em>FF7</em> had opened a window, but the door remained closed.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to stumble upon change in the wild and have it happen to me without having to ask. I wanted there to be words I never had to seek out. I wanted it to be easy, because I always wanted it to be easy. I wanted Cloud to point through the screen and demand my attention as he recited the words that could describe a body severed from its heart. I wanted words like ‘transgender” and “dysphoria” to materialize, even though I didn’t know they were real.&nbsp;</p><p>On <em>Parasite Eve</em>’s stage, as Aya has her gun trained on the fire-conjuring opera singer, Eve monologues about the cells in the body, how they call out in desperate communication. Then I’m controlling the action; I let Aya shoot Eve in the chest for very little damage. Eve laughs, and Aya wonders what is changing in her. “My Body!…It’s…! It’s getting hot!”&nbsp;</p><p>As Aya’s latent Parasite Energy came alive in her, my mind cried out with desire for questions it never knew were real. Eve says, “Just what I thought”, but gives no explanation why.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Parasite Eve</em> plays with formula. Engage in combat and the game becomes a blend of <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Aya moves freely within the environment, able to sidestep attacks and wait for her action meter to build. She is like me, waiting to be ready. Throughout the game, Aya has a gun, then a club, then another, bigger gun. She has armour and stats and levels up. You can freely move about the battlefield, stopping only to select commands to attack, use items, or take control of Aya’s Parasite Energy. There are early shades of what would become the active battle mechanics of the overwrought remakes of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, but here it’s pared down, with no party to control or broader magic system. It’s streamlined, beautiful in its simplicity. It’s a game that puts you into its world so completely that you might never return.&nbsp;</p><p>After Aya defeats her on the stage, Eve flees into the basement of Carnegie Hall like the Phantom lurking below the world. You can choose to jump down and give chase, or you can choose to forget it. I have only ever jumped down immediately. When you land, a mysterious child awaits you, and Aya gives chase into the stone hallways of the basement. A rat mutates before her eyes, its monstrous transformation triggered by changing cells in its body. It becomes a grotesque version of its former self, and then in death it becomes nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>In dressing rooms, bodies lay charred and dying on the floor, one of whom mutters the name “Melissa” as it succumbs. A diary in another room tells me that Melissa is the body that Eve has grown inside of, taken over and turned into something more. Something evil, but something aware of who they are. Melissa writes in her diary about the life she wants for herself and how she would make a deal with the devil to have it, even just for a moment.&nbsp;</p><p>The words in Melissa’s diary are familiar desires for desperate change. She knows there is something in her, something dangerous maybe, that she cannot find words to describe. Her desires have a name she doesn’t know for a change she cannot imagine. I remember my own hands clasped in desperate prayer for whatever God or devil might change me, and the fear that whatever I was hiding in my body might destroy everything I know. How afraid I was to admit I was willing to take the risk.&nbsp;</p><p>When Aya eventually finds Eve once more, she tells her of the mitochondria in the body she can manipulate and control, how she can turn anyone and anything into whatever she sees fit. Anyone save Aya, with whom she shares a secret bond, and is immune to the transformations happening around them. Aya fights more rats, a mutated parrot, and Eve again. Out of combat, the game returns the tank controls and clunky movement to my hands and I bid Aya to move. As she runs, I can hear the click-clack of her steps on the floor, and I worry about her feet in those heels.</p><p>The monstrous change Eve brings about in the lives she destroys should be terrifying, but it lights a fire of possibility in my chest all the same. I never tell anyone I want to know how it feels to be made so wholly new. In the game it’s grotesque, but that’s just pixels telling a story. I wonder how it would feel for my own bones to grow and reform into the beautiful vision of a body hidden in my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the Carnegie Hall incident, Aya dons her civilian attire: blue jeans, white shirt, leather jacket. Effortlessly cool but no less alluring. I move Aya through New York City as Eve turns people into goop and animals into monsters. We fight at the zoo, at the natural history museum. We battle on a carriage pulled at breakneck speed by a horse on fire. With each encounter, Eve begs Aya to join with her, become one with her. The body is hot, and desperate, and yearning. Aya defies Eve’s call, but questions herself all the same. Someone different from her peers, seeking to understand who she is becoming without hiding from the power challenging her perception of the truth of her body.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of representation has changed in the years since I searched for words and phrases in places they would never appear. I built ideas out of imperfect texts, and found sanctuary where none was slated to be built. Now, when the words appear, they are focused, honed like a blade. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has a trans bartender who street races with a truck emblazoned with a trans flag. The ghost in <em>Paper Mario</em> is canonically trans. There are flags and phrases hidden among the digital bric-a-brac of the world. This is all a net positive, but building a name for myself from grotesque and beautiful hints made transness an idea that never really needed the right words in order to build an altar to limitless potential. I need the answer of transness less than I needed the possibility of the questions it begged me to ask, of who I was and what I could build of myself by challenging an easy narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There were no words to describe who I really wanted to be, but there were hints and allegations, and they were alive in <em>Parasite Eve</em>. I played it all without ever once turning the Playstation off, and when it was over I played it again, searching for the secrets that might yet reveal themselves to me.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs"><h3>Gamurs Websites Aren’t Just Laying Off Workers, Entire Sites Are Being Mothballed</h3></a><p>'Entire websites, like the Escapist and Twinfinite, are just sitting basically dormant'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo"><h3>The Pitt&nbsp;Isn’t&nbsp;Just Another Anxiety-Inducing Medical Drama</h3></a><p>In between instilling an appreciation for medical personnel, it’ll have you fujoshiing out</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-out-now-with-enhanced-combatmovement-and-free-friends-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> CI Games <a href="https://x.com/CIGamesOfficial/status/1912876320360439961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that there will be a small delay to the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0 on Steam due to a technical issue. The Epic Games Store, Windows Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X versions are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Today, CI Games launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen 2.0</a>, a 'definitive' update to the Soulslike game that seeks to address several of the community's requests. Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates. The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.</em></p>
<p>As the executive mentioned, the game now includes fully shared co-op progression and a Free Friend's Pass. There's now free access to the character creator and the entire tutorial area of the base game. Following the completion of the tutorial, players can experience the entire adventure in online co-operative multiplayer when playing with a friend who owns the base game. Character progress and loot are saved between sessions, though only the host retains world progression.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen 2.0, both co-op players save all mainline story progress when on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough, having killed a similar number of main bosses (within one). Defeated bosses and lit beacons persist in both worlds; both players can revive each other and collect 100% vigor and all loot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen 2.0 Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WOqW5SRwYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are also other improvements to be found in Lords of the Fallen 2.0. The character creator now includes improved facial options, skin textures, and body shapes for both male and female models. The User Interface has been overhauled to be cleaner and easier to navigate, and a new guidebook has been added so players may reference previous tutorial prompts at any time.</p>
<p>The combat system now has more accurate weapon handling and refined lock-on mechanics. Mobility has been improved, featuring quicker evasion moves and more responsive controls. A dedicated jump button improves the platforming experience. Weapon audio was enhanced, amplifying every swing, parry, and block. A brand-new Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic now highlights the path forward through Mournstead. Lastly, new grievous strike button prompts have been added.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a free update for existing users. Any potential newcomers can now get the game at discounted pricing:</p>
<p>● PlayStation Spring Sale (April 9th – April 23rd):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 72% off at $19.60<br>
○ Deluxe Upgrade Pack (from Standard to Deluxe): 72% off at $5.60<br>
● Xbox Spring Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 70% off at $20.99, also included in Game Pass<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 70% off at $23.99<br>
● Steam Custom Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10<br>
● Epic Games Store Savings (April 10th – April 24th):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10</p>
<p>The game didn't score highly <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, but perhaps he'll be willing to give it another chance with the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0.</p>

Despite all this secrecy, one thing Marvel has finally lifted the curtain on in this second trailer is <em>Ozark </em>actor Julia Garner as the Silver Surfer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,197298,197284" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Garner’s version of the Silver Surfer is Shalla-Bal, who is known in the comics as the second Silver Surfer alongside her lover Norrin Radd, the male surfer most typically associated with the title. It’s unclear if Norrin will show up in <em>First Steps</em>, or if the Marvel Cinematic Universe is playing with the character’s backstory. Either way, the Silver Surfer is the “herald” of Galactus, who marks Earth for destruction before the big guy shows up to do his thing. We see her confronting the Fantastic Four, and her arrival sends the public into a frenzy. Everyone is looking to the heroes for answers and reassurance, and Mister Fantastic straight-up tells them that shit looks bleak. All of this is happening as the Fantastic Four is expecting a new addition, as Sue Storm is pregnant, and an incoming apocalypse is not an ideal situation to bring a baby into.</p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p>All four members of the Fantastic Four are confirmed to star in the upcoming <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, as each actor was featured in Marvel’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474">obnoxiously long casting reveal last month</a></span>.

Amid all the new tricks and modes, Nintendo also confirmed a slew of new and returning tracks and racers for Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the course side, there were several new courses shown off as part of the roamable world. From the streets of Crown City to the water of Salty Salty Speedway, there are plenty of places to explore and shortcuts to discover. Mechanics like wall-riding and grinding seem like they'll add quite a bit for players to uncover. Here's what we spotted in today's Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Confirmed Courses Shown in Today's Direct</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario Bros.

Mario Kart World looks to be making some deep pulls from Mario's history. The usual suspects of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi are joined by the likes of Spike, Conkdor, Penguin, and more. Here's everyone we spotted in a kart during today's Mario Kart World Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World Confirmed Racers From Today's Direct</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario</li><li>Luigi</li><li>Peach</li><li>Daisy</li><li>Rosalina</li><li>Pauline</li><li>Yoshi</li><li>Toad</li><li>Koopa Troopa</li><li>Baby Mario</li><li>Baby Luigi</li><li>Baby Peach</li><li>Baby Daisy</li><li>Baby Rosalina</li><li>Wario</li><li>Waluigi</li><li>Bowser</li><li>Goomba</li><li>Spike</li><li>Cow</li><li>Lakitu</li><li>Toadette</li><li>Bowser Jr.</li><li>Birdo</li><li>King Boo</li><li>Shy Guy</li><li>Donkey Kong</li><li>Nabbit</li><li>Pirahna Plant</li><li>Hammer Bro</li><li>Monty Mole</li><li>Sidestepper</li><li>Cheep Cheep</li><li>Dry Bones</li><li>Wiggler</li><li>Cataquack</li><li>Pianta</li><li>Rocky Wrench</li><li>Conkdor</li><li>Chargin' Chuck</li><li>Penguin</li><li>Stingby</li><li>Swoop</li><li>Dolphin</li><li>Para-Biddybud</li><li>Pokey</li><li>Coin Coffer</li><li>Peepa</li><li>Snowman</li><li>Fish Bone</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite a line-up so far, and will probably only expand as we learn more about this game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo shared with us a Mario Kart World Direct and it revealed much more about the launch title for the Nintendo Switch, including new details on characters, courses, races, secrets, and so much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This roundup has gathered everything you need to know about this Mario Kart World Direct and we hope it will help with the wait until this much-anticipated game launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Courses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World will feature a ton of new and old courses on its interconnected map, and we were introduced to a few of them today, including Mario Bros. Circuit, Crown City, Salty Salty Speedway, Starview Peak, Boo Cinema, Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What should be most exciting for returning Mario Kart players is that the older courses have been "reimagined to feel at-home within this vast, new world, offering fresh experiences on classics." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Characters and New Techniques</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering up to 24 racers can compete in one race, Mario Kart World will need a lot of characters to ensure everyone doesn't play the same one. While there are sure to be more added and revealed, this Direct featured such characters as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina, Rosalina, Koopa, Rocky Wrench, Conkdor, Goomba, Spike, Cow, King Boo, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Birdo, Bowser Jr., Lakitu, Toad, Wario, Pauline, Toadette, Shy Guy, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, Hammer Bro, Monty Mole, Dry Bones, Wiggler, Cataquack, Pianta, Sidestepper, and Cheep Cheep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving with these characters will be even more fun this time around as there are new techniques to utilize. Charge Jump gives racers a chance to dodge enemy attacks, reach higher places and rails that can be grinded on, and even jump towards a wall to ride on it for a short time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting new additions is Rewind, as it will let players try again to reach a hidden path or take a turn better or whatever! However, it is important to note that rivals will still move normally if you rewind so you could find yourself in even more trouble if you aren't careful.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Races - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two main modes in Mario Kart World - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix will be the mode fans are used to as players will need to compete in multiple races to win the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Flower Cup, and more. However, this time around players will drive from course to course instead of exiting out to a menu, which should make for a much more seamless experience thanks to Mario Kart World's more open structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to conquer all of the Grand Prix Cups, a certain "colorful course" may appear which sure sounds like Rainbow Road. It won't be easy though, as there will be new obstacles like cars that shoot bullet bills and Hammer Bros. that throw their namesake hammers!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knockout Tour is a battle-royale-esque mode where you have to race from one side of Mario Kart World's map to the other. The only catch is you have to be in a certain place at each checkpoint or you will be knocked out of the race. The winner will be the last driver standing in the Golden Rally, Ice Rally, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Free Roam</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode, players will be able to drive wherever they'd like without the worry of trying to be in first place. As you explore, you will discover things like P Switches (hundreds of them!) that will activate blue coins you'll need to collect and start missions. These missions will be challenges that will improve your skills outside of races.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be hidden coins like Peach Medallions, hidden panels, and much more. Oh, and there is a photo mode in Free Roam that will be available to always capture that perfect moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visiting Yoshi's restaurant will also be a joy as you can pick up "Dash Food" that will give you a boost of speed and an outfit inspired by your meal! Some examples shown were a cheeseburger, sushi, skewers, chips, roasted meat, pizza, ice cream, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playing Mario Kart World with Friends</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Mario Kart World with friends will undoubtedly be one of the best ways to play this racing game, and Nintendo is giving players a ton of options in how they can do that. Such options include having four players play on one system, local wireless play with up to eight players (two systems of four), and up to 24 players from around the world playing in Online Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big feature in Mario Kart World is allowing players to free roam with their friends in between races. Players will be able to see where their friends are on the map and fast travel to them for some fun. You can then battle or race with custom rules or just explore the map with them. Photo Mode will also be available for friends!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GameChat will also be an integral part of Mario Kart World as players will be able to talk to their friends and even see their reactions live on video for those who have a comptabile camera. If all players are on a single system, the camera can even detect up to four faces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Modes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the modes we mentioned above, players will be able to jump into Time Trials, where there will also be an option to go online and race against ghost data of others around the world. VS Mode is next and it offers a ton of customization, including the option to compete with up to four different teams of racers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle Mode is back as well, and it includes such coompetitions as Coin Runners and Balloon Battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Items</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there will be familiar items returning to Mario Kart like Bullet Bill and Lightning, there will also be some new additions like the Coin Shell that can knock rivals off course and provide a trail of coins for players to collect. There will also be an Ice Flower to freeze enemies, Hammers to attack enemies and block their paths, a Mega Mushroom that will grow players to monstrous heights, a Feather that will let players jump to avoid attacks, and even a Kamek item that will call in the classic character to transform players into something mysterious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Support Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World is aiming to be a game for players of all skill levels, and to reach that goal Nintendo is including some support features to help like Smart Steering, Tilt Controls (Joy-Con 2 wheel compatible!), Auto-Use Item, Auto-Accelerate, and the ability to adjust both the Vertical and Horizontal Camera.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview of Mario Kart World,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">how Nintendo is justifying its $80 price tag,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">our big Nintendo Switch 2 interview with Nintendo's Bill Trinen</a> to learn more about the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

<p>Earlier this month, Nintendo let Ars Technica and other outlets have access to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">a small hands-on slice of <em>Mario Kart World</em></a> ahead of its planned June 5 launch. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq4uCJDwO9U">a short livestreamed video presentation</a> gave a bit of extra information about how exactly the full version of the free-roaming Nintendo Switch 2 launch game will work in practice.</p>
<p>As the name implies, <em>Mario Kart World</em> sets itself apart from previous games via a "vast interconnected world" that you can roam freely between the actual race courses. That open space between races will feature "hundreds of P-switches," Nintendo said, each of which activates a small mission to "hone your driving abilities." Free-roaming racers will also be able to find hidden medallions and question-mark panels, as well as "drive-thru" food items that can be used to unlock new outfits.</p>

<p>While cruising around the Mario Kart "world," players will stumble onto new courses "inspired by their surrounding region," as well as "nostalgic courses for past titles... reimagined and spread throughout the world." When playing in Grand Prix mode, the drive between these courses will be integrated into the usual four-course cups themselves; after racing Mario Kart Circuit in the Mushroom cup, for instance, the second race&nbsp;"will have you covering the distance from Mario Bros. Circuit to Crown City," Nintendo said.</p>
<p>The game's other main race mode, Knockout Tour, slowly whittles 24 racers down to just four via checkpoints spaced throughout the course. These "extended rallies" will take racers across the game world, with one track seamlessly flowing into another on a preset path.</p>

<p>Players who prefer a more traditional three-lap race on a single course can do so via the game's VS Mode races. The traditional battle mode will also return, with a Balloon Battle mode focused on hitting other players with weapons and a Coin Runners mode focused on getting more money than your opponents.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/power-and-peril-how-diablo-and-darkest-dungeon-designers-define-the-rpg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>For Sigman and the Darkest Dungeon team, it was important to establish an overarching design philosophy that was set in place. That said, the details within that framework may change or evolve significantly during development.</p>
<p>“In this age of early access and easily updatable games, balance is a living thing,” Sigman said. “It’s highly iterative throughout the game’s public life. We will update balance based upon community feedback, analytics, evolving metas, and also reflections on our own design philosophies and approaches.”</p>

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The problem, of course, is that every change to an existing game is a double-edged sword. With each update, you risk breaking the very elements you’re trying to fix.</p>
<p>Speaking to that ongoing balancing act, Sigman admits, “It’s not without its challenges. We’ve found that many players eagerly await such updates, but a subset gets really angry when developers change balance elements.”</p>
<p>Getting one of your favorite heroes or abilities nerfed can absolutely sink a game or destroy a strategy you’ve relied on for success. The team relies on a number of strictly mathematical tools to help isolate and solve balance problems, but on some level, it’s an artistic and philosophical question.</p>
<p>“A good example is how to address ‘exploits’ in a game,” Sigman said. “Some games try to hurriedly stamp out all possible exploits. With a single-player game, I think you have more leeway to let some exploits stand. It’s nice to let players get away with some stuff. If you kick sand over every exploit that appears, you remove some of the fun.”</p>
<p>As with so many aspects of game design, perfecting the balance between adversity and empowerment comes down to a simple question.</p>
<p>“One amazing piece of wisdom from Sid Meier, my personal favorite designer, is to remember to ask yourself, ‘Who is having the fun here? The designer or the player?’ It should be the player,” Sigman told us.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of approach that players love to hear. Even if a decision is made to make a game more difficult, particularly in an existing game, it should be done to make the play experience more enjoyable. If it begins to feel like devs are making balance changes just to scale down players’ power, it can begin to feel like you’re being punished for having fun.</p>
<p>The fine balance between power and challenge is a hard one to strike, but what players ultimately want is to have a good time. Sometimes that means feeling like a world-destroying demigod, and sometimes it means squeaking through a bloody boss encounter with a single hit point. Most often, though, you're looking for a happy medium: a worthy challenge overcome through power and skill.</p>

The aforementioned harvesting mechanic at the heart of the enemy AI systems allows for multiple evolutions. Enemies don't just get stronger, they can also learn new attack patterns and mutate into new character models. The pair showed off how basic enemies have two tiers of evolution, meaning players who can't knock down every enemy will face an entirely new kind of monster that could turn the tide in a fight.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-need-to-define-what-it-means-to-be-safe-as-gamers-around-the-world-a-code-of-ethics-in-gaming" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to define what it means to be safe as [players] around the world:' a code of ethics in gaming</a></p><p>Image via Bloober Team.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair explained that gunplay and traversal in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">isn't just an updated version of what Bloober made in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Player movement and shooting is meant to mimic what is often referred to as the "tank controls" of survival horror games from the late '90s and early 2000s. These games limited player movement, slowed down aiming, and used restrictive camera angles to make it harder to spot enemies at a distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though novel for their time, advancements in video game combat as a whole make "tank controls" a less appealing experience for most modern players. To recreate that sensation without relying on decades-old restrictions, Bloober made two key design decisions. The more subtle one was to mandate that guns not fire with a simple trigger press. They need to be charged up, giving enemies time to close the gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The more surprising choice—one that greatly diverges from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—was to not give players a "dodge" button. Players instead are given a resource-dependent flamethrower burst that can push enemies away or eliminate dead bodies used for power-ups. The resource-juggling is familiar to survival horror, but denying players a dodge button goes against recent trends. None of this, the pair said, could be done without Bloober increasing headcount and seeking out developers with specific skills.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-a-vicious-cycle-translator-unions-call-out-keywords-for-lowballing-contract-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">'A vicious cycle:' Translator unions call out Keywords for lowballing contract workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We bolster a team [with] specific people," said Zieba, noting that Bloober hired a dedicated "gunsmith" whose sole job would be making the charge-heavy guns.

"It's easier to get better specialists who love survival horror like us," he said. Zieba said the studio at large still operates in a "hybrid" mode.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features more than 100 notes to collect and read, and it's worth searching for each one. Compulsion Games knocked it out of the park regarding storytelling in South of Midnight, and these notes are no exception.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll notice more notes to grab in this chapter than in any previous chapter. So if you were going to try and find them yourself, it's best to be vigilant about searching an area before you move on.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you want to make sure you don't miss any of the 15 notes in Chapter 7. Here's where to grab each one.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 had 11 notes to find, Chapter 6 had 10, and now Chapter 7 has 15. And that's not even the most you'll see in a single chapter. But that's still to come.</p>

<p><strong>The Lost Boy</strong> - At the start of the chapter, follow the path until you hear Hazel point out the old sawmill, which will happen just before you're about to jump across a river. Jump across, and turn left to find a climbing path that leads you up and around the rock wall to an area blocked by the bramble and vines. You'll find the note on a box next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lost Liquor</strong> - You'll find this note after the first combat encounter of the chapter. Once you've cleared it, look to the right and you'll likely be able to spy a health filament behind some branches. You'll find the note resting on some boxes just ahead of the branches, and since you're there, you might as well grab the filament.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lieutenant Laurent</strong> - When you reach the memory object showing a clip of Hazel's mother, look to your right. You'll find the note on an old dresser at the entrance to a path with a box and a Floof knot to jump to.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Babblin' Boy</strong> - After finding the last note and crossing the river, turn left to find a path blocked by some branches you can push out of the way. Behind them, you'll find the note on a box next to a metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Baby Faced Laurent</strong> - From the last note, follow the path, and you'll have to cross the river again, using echoes of a bridge to do so. Once you've passed the echo bridge, turn left, and you'll find this note on a box next to another metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Lil' Drunkards</strong> - After finding the last note, follow the path and jump over two big bramble vines. You'll see this note in a hollow dead tree that should be directly in front of you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>End of Prohibition -&nbsp;</strong>After clearing the combat encounter that ends with you using Crouton to clear the Stigma, you'll head under a large tree as you follow the path to leave. This note is to the right of the path, underneath the tree.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Boy out of Time</strong> - You'll find this note almost immediately after you find the last one. Once you walk beyond the tree, you'll see a building to your right. The note is resting on a structure just on the porch of the building.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Heart of Lace</strong> - After the cutscene with Laurent at the Juke Joint, head back into the shop and go up the stairs. You'll find this note on a box next to Laurent and Lacey's picture.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> - Once you reach Milltown after using the grapple, head straight down the path, and you'll find this note inside the house on the right, on a table next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Mother's Last Words</strong> - Inside the same house you find the last note in, this note is on a bedframe at the back of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Everything Helps</strong> - When you enter Milltown, you'll be able to see a broken-down well to your left. Turn left past the well, and then look to your right to see a building that's missing a wall. Walk into the building to find this note on a box on your right, just ahead of a combat encounter.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Father's Job</strong> - After clearing the combat arena just beyond the last note you found, and watching the first of Laurent's memories, this one will be waiting for you in a building to the right of a big crane, next to two giant saws crossed over each other and making an 'X'.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Penny Saved</strong> - You'll find this one on the second floor of the sawmill, which you reach after finding all four of Laurent's memories. When you make it to the second floor, you'll use your grapple to cross a big gap around the outside of he mill. Once you're back inside, look to your left to see some wood you can push out of the way. Push that, then another bundle of wood, and you'll see this note resting on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Maintaining Productivity</strong> - This last note can be found in the office, just beyond where you found the previous note. You'll also find a Floof knot in this office, right next to the note on a desk.</p>
<p>And that's where you can find all 15 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 7. If you've followed these guides so far, you'll have found 53 out of the 103. Only 50 more to go.</p>

			<p>Nintendo streamed its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/">Mario Kart World Direct</a> this morning, which included a more detailed look at gameplay in Mario Kart World, and some of the new features players can expect.</p>
<p>The presentation was only 15 minutes long, and was a back-to-back dive into different aspects of Mario Kart World, like some of the new courses, characters, tricks, items and game modes for players in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>We know plenty of the big news about Mario Kart World, like the fact that the new open-world setting means we can drive anywhere and spend time freely roaming around the world and the tracks. The direct also showed for the first time that there are plenty of challenges and hidden items to find while doing so, like blue-coin P challenges to discover, hidden coins and hidden panels.</p>
<p>You can also use photo mode whenever you want while in free roam, and if you're playing with friends online, or even locally, you don't necessarily jump into a race or Grand Prix to play together. You can instead just drive around the world, enjoy the views, and create your own fun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The direct showcased eight of the courses we'll all be racing on, with some returning tracks players will recognize and some brand new. Rest assured there is more than what was shown, but the ones we got to look at were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li>
<li>Crown City</li>
<li>Salty Salty Speedway</li>
<li>Starview Peak</li>
<li>Boo Cinema</li>
<li>Toad's Factory</li>
<li>Peach Beach</li>
<li>Wario Shipyard</li>
</ul>
<p>We also got a not-so-slight-hint that to unlock Mario Kart World's version of the infamous Rainbow Road, you'll have to complete and win each of the Grand Prix's in the game. Regarding the characters you can race as, we once again didn't get a look at the full roster, but we did get a closer look at four of the new racers, which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Cow</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Lakitu</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of new items, six items were highlighted in the direct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Feather</li>
<li>Ice Flower</li>
<li>Coin Shell</li>
<li>Mega Mushroom</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the six shown, being able to use Kamek's magic looks like it will be the most interesting one, and the one with the potential to really shake things up in the race, as you transform your competing racers into various things. The rest seem like your bog-standard hazards and boosts, though when combined with the increased number of road hazards that'll just appear in each track, which we also got a look at, these races are shaping up to be some of the most hectic in the entire series.</p>
<p>Nintendo also confirmed that the racing wheel for the Joy-Con controllers is back with the Joy-Con 2 Wheel, purpose-built for the new Joy-Con 2 controllers, and racers new to the series will have similar features included in Mario Kart 8, like smart steering at their disposal, should they need it.</p>
<p>The last two new features shown in the direct that seem to bring a good deal of change to the game were two new tricks, Rewind and Charge Jump. The latter is kind of like an ollie on a skateboard, where you'll just jump straight up to help you avoid obstacles, but also jump onto grind rails to reach new areas, and find new paths on each track.</p>
<p>Rewind does exactly what it sounds like it does, and rewinds what you've just done in-game so you can try again. But you're not rewinding the entire race when you use it, you're only rewinding the actions you've taken. Which means if you rewind while in 1st place because you want to try grinding a rail again, you can put yourself in 2nd just to try and get that sick clip.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a solid showcase of what's to come in Mario Kart World, but whether it did as Nintendo of America president <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Doug Bowser</a> hoped it would, and convince players that Mario Kart World is worth its $80 price tag, is to be determined.</p>
<p>If you want to check out more about Mario Kart World, you can read what we thought when we went <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the game at a recent Nintendo Switch 2 event</a>.</p>

These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In&nbsp;this article,&nbsp;we'll have a detailed look at a brand new force for Cygnar, the Gravediggers, with their first releases, the Gravediggers Command Starter and Battlegroup Box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=JJvrSvU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=Wf9h_BqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When the Trenchers go to war, they don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>From The Skies!</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction for Warmachine, and can trace their history back to the early days of Warmachine in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original Warmachine and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>

<p>There's a roadmap of releases planned for them, but they begin with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which features a perfect 30-point army to jump straight into games with them, and follows those starter forces from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-review-sneaky-villainy" rel="nofollow">Shadows and Scum</a> and provides players with one of each unit type. Releasing alongside the Command Starter is the Gravediggers Battlegroup Box, which features a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks to expand your Command Starter, or start playing at lower model count games. Both of these sets feature crates and items that make use of their Airdrop rules, and we'll go into details of both sets and their rules below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=1CYBU9rU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=eeKNW4CU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The contents of the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Command Starter Set.</figcaption></figure><h2>Watch Out For Buck</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Starter Set is a great introduction to how the Gravediggers like to play, which is sneaky and devastating. This box is led by&nbsp;Captain Buck Hasker, who has Prowl, which gives him stealth if he has concealment, protecting him from attacks more than 5 inches away. He also passes this on to his Warjack, which means that every unit in this box has Prowl. Buck likes to leap from concealment and chain attacks with Killing Spree, which lets him make an additional attack if he removes an enemy model in melee. His close combat weapon, Fang, which stops the use of Tough, makes doing that a lot easier. His feat allows him to place 3 mine tokens within his control range, which deal damage and knock down any enemies coming within 3 inches of them. This is great for protecting him while he gets some wet work done, effectively locking him into an area with his target.</p>

<p>Buck's Warjack, Plugger, is an absolute beast of a heavy Warjack. Operating like Buck, moving to engage its target, and if destroyed, making a full advance back into hiding. Plugger comes with Stealth (not Prowl), which means he doesn't have to be in concealment to gain the benefits of Stealth. Plugger comes armed with dual trench rippers and a metal storm cannon to get the job done.</p>

Ramjaw uses a backpack-fed minigun to knock infantry troops back. The Rowdies give each other overlapping buffs while they're still on the field. Killing Spree, Reposition, and Precision Fire are all granted to each other, and they all come with Smoke Bombs as standard to make them difficult to target, which is helpful as they're all fairly short ranged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-7.jpg?itok=G_NBBYdS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-7.jpg?itok=755D-BVF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Plugger is an absolute monster in combat, and their airdrops make the whole army super adaptable.</figcaption></figure><p>This box also comes with an Ammo Crate and Medical Crate miniature, which can be taken as command cards and allows you to drop the crate within 1 inch of the activating unit. The Ammo Crate lets a nearby friendly unit gain Magical to its attacks and by dealing 1 damage to the crate, boost the range or power of their ranged attack by 2. The Medical Crate allows nearby friendly units to deal one damage to the crate, to either remove a damage from a model with Tough that is disabled nearby, or remove D3+2 damage from a living model, or return a Grunt to a unit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-4.jpg?itok=B-NYXsbw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-4.jpg?itok=JyKS4YZj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The contents of the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Battle Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>Like Father, Like Daughter</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box works a little differently to the Command Starter in that it includes a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks, and doesn't make a clean 30-point force. It can create a 30-point force, but the Warjacks have a variety of weapon options, so you'll have to do some planning before you build them. The set is great if you want to play a 30-point game with a smaller number of units, or perfect if you want to expand beyond the Command Starter.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box includes&nbsp;Captain Cynthia 'Cyn' Rosko, who is the daughter of the famous&nbsp;Allister Caine we covered in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set review</a>. Rosko has inherited her father's affinity to magic and comes armed with the Witch Hammer rocket launcher, which allows her to ignore cloud effects and stealth to strike her target if she aims. Her feat grants all models in her battleground and control range to make an additional ranged or melee attack that turn, which can mean an absolutely insane gunline attack for 1 turn.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=nOAnYbm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=VwTkrKuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko can set up an insane gunline with her feat.</figcaption></figure><p>Both of the Warjacks in this set, the Valient (Heavy Warjack) and the Patriot (Light Warjack), come with build options for their heads and weapons. The head options give different abilities, which for the Valiant, means choosing between being faster and able to charge without spending a focus point, moving after being hit with an attack, a free move if it didn't run during the turn, and free move and attack if a friendly unit is taken out nearby. The Patriot also has 4 weapon options for each arm, which vary in point costs and types. Personally I'm a fan of the Volley Gun/Shield and Heavy Mortar loadout to rain down fire on anyone threatening the rest of the Gravediggers as they close the distance on their enemies.</p>

<p>The Patriot also has 4 head options, an arc node that allows casters to channel through it, the ability to move after taking out an enemy, a&nbsp;free move if it didn't run during the turn, or can bodyguard a nearby friendly unit. As with the Valiant, the Patriot comes with 4 weapon options for each arm, and how you want to use your Warjacks will determine how you arm them, including getting the best use of the rest of your force's buffs and your Warcaster's feat. Personally I'm a fan of the Sniper Cannon and Blaster/Shield combo to lay down fire at rage and boost your Warjack's armor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=XWnFyP9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=NDRu67Bk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko loves to set up a gunline, and the heavy weapons crate just reinforces it.</figcaption></figure><p>Also in the Gravediggers Battle Box is a heavy weapons crate which works with the Heavy Airdrop Command Card. This card allows you to drop a Blocker or a Skirmisher Warjack onto the battlefield, or a Heavy Weapons Crate, which the Valiant Warjack can interact with to gain a Heavy Flamethrower, Howitzer, or Rocket Pod. It also gains +1 armor for the rest of the game, and a bonus focus point for the turn it interacts with the crate. This adaptability is one of the Gravedigger's greatest strengths, and your opponent will never be sure if you're about to get another Warjack, or your Valient is about to gain an extra weapon and go to town on their forces.</p>



<p>I'm so glad that the release of the Gravediggers coincided with me getting back into <em>Warmachine,</em> as they feel like a faction perfectly suited to my style of play. I love that they're a hard as nails combat force, but they're also super sneaky and insanely adaptable to the changing battlefield. These 2 boxes offer a dual style of entry. The clean Command Starter, with its fixed armaments and full roster of unit types, or the smaller Battle Box that still shows what the Gravediggers are all about, and has customization options for the Warjacks' loadouts. Their paratrooper/special forces feel sits well with me, and their theme is captured extremely well in their mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with previous <em>Warmachine</em> releases, these set are just miniatures, as the rules and stats are all available for free on the <em>Warmachine</em> app and you will have to add a couple of accessories (dice, measuring tool, and tokens) to get playing, but once you have those, getting started with the Gravediggers is easy.</p>

The publisher held a <em>Mario Kart World</em> direct presentation on April 17th debuting 15 minutes of gameplay which showcased many of the game’s new features.</p><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> will feature a bunch of new courses to race through. There’s Mario Bros Circuit, the desert roadtrip-looking course Nintendo’s shown off in every <em>Mario Kart World</em> video; an urban course called Crown City; Salty Salty Speedway, which is one of <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s water levels; and many more including returning classics like Peach Beach and Wario Shipyard. Nintendo also hinted that once you complete all the Grand Prix cups a “certain colorful course” will appear which can’t be anything other than the iconic Rainbow Road.</p><p>There are lots of new items, features, and settings to make the most out of your race to the finish. The new feather item lets you jump to avoid attacks. The new rewind feature lets you rewind time so you can hit that missed trick or jump to find secret areas. Speaking of secret areas, in the game’s free roam mode you can find all kinds of hidden secrets like P-switches and panels that unlock overworld missions to complete. Nintendo’s gone all out to make <em>Mario Kart World</em> the standout game for the Switch 2 — now if only the US could pre-order the dang thing.</p><p>You can watch the full event below:</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">initial excitement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2</a> has cooled. Consumers have been left reeling from the price of the console, announced at $450, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">which has the potential to balloon in the United States</a> due to the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">ruinous tariff policy</a>. (Trump has decreed a 90-day pause on the tariffs which ostensibly gives Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">more time to ship to the US as many units as it can</a>.)</p></div><p>The games too will be more expensive, with some titles, including <em>Mario Kart World</em>, blowing past the $70 price point <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">to retail at $80</a>. That is, if you can even get the console to play it. US consumers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">cannot yet pre-order the Switch 2</a> (once again, thanks to the tariffs) which has also impeded Canada from pre-orders as well.

            <p>Harken to the tolling of the village bell! See the blazing of the watchfires on the parapet! CD Projekt have issued a warning about Witcher 4 beta scams. Apparently, people have been receiving invites to playtest the new Witcher, even though CD Projekt have previously said that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't release before 2027</a>. If you sign up to anything right now, the only thing you'll be beta-testing is how fast you can change all your usernames and passwords.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - this is a scam!" shrieks a <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1912514283847504311">social media post</a>, like a cleric at the chapel door ushering the peasants inside. "We've been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down. That said, if you receive any invites to or stumble upon news of one, we kindly ask you to report the scam using the tools available to you in your email client or the social media platform you are using."</p>
<p>"Remember: professional monster slayers don't fall for scams," the post adds, just in case that immersion-breaking mention of email clients had sabotaged your day with the knowledge that you are not, in fact, a greying leathery Lothario with a silver sword. "They see right through them and slay them!"</p>
<p>Not to rap you on the nose with a rolled-up lore bible, CD Projekt, but I think that characterisation does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-explain-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer-geralt-could-have-said-this-about-ciri-as-well">The Witcher's emotive branching storytelling</a> a disservice. If this were a quest from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, Geralt would probably trace the scammers to their lair and discover that they are actually small orphan children who were cruelly disfigured and cast out by the villagers on account of having hairy toes, or something. He would have to decide between butchering them or butchering the villagers or blowing up Megaton. Then he would partake in some sex with a witch (I 'ardly knew 'er, etc) and play a rousing round of Triple Triad. I confess, my memories of The Witcher 3 are a little rusty.</p>
<p>"Should we ever organize any beta tests in the future, you will hear about it first, as always, via our official social media and websites," CD Projekt conclude. While you wait, you can re-read Ed Thorn's (RPS in peace) frenzied demands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-needs-a-double-jumping-horse-like-elden-ring-or-im-out">for a double-jumping horse</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though it’s been steeped in some controversy along the way, the kart racer looks like a pretty substantial leap forward after a decade of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. Nintendo held a dedicated Direct showcase for the game this morning, and if you want to watch the 15-minute presentation you can do so below. For everyone who just wants some of the highlights, here are some of the new things we learned during showcase.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-recommend-id="image://9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-recommend-id="image://9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Direct started with a showcase of different courses, including new tracks and reimaginings of old ones. Some of the courses Nintendo spotlighted were the metropolis Crown City, the Venice-esque Salty Salty Speedway, the icy trails of Starview Peak, and a drive-in theater called Boo Cinema. Some of the old tracks from previous games that will be reimagined for World include Toad’s Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-recommend-id="image://1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-recommend-id="image://1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two main racing modes in <em>Mario Kart World </em>are the classic Grand Prix seen in previous games that takes you and 23 other players through multiple courses to see who comes out on top, and a new mode called Knockout Tour. These are lengthy, multi-track races that gradually pick off players as they go on. Racers will drive through different checkpoints that will gradually eliminate players in the lower positions. It’s kind of like <em>Mario Kart</em> battle royale.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-recommend-id="image://0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-recommend-id="image://0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo showed off new usable items that will help give you an edge in a race. Some new ones include: The Coin shell that puts coins on the track for you (or your enemies) to grab, the Ice Flower that freezes your enemies, Hammers, thrown in a classic Hammer Bros. arc, to smash and block your opponents where they land, Mega Mushrooms that make you big enough to run over your enemies, Feathers that give you more air time and let you find alternate routes, and Kamek, which seems like a bit of a wild card item that can have different effects.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-recommend-id="image://f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-recommend-id="image://f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo announced a few features and playstyles that will help the game be more accessible. The big one is smart steering that keeps you from driving off the side of the track, as well as motion controls for people who want to steer using the Joy-Con controllers’ support for that functionality.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-recommend-id="image://cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi dragging a pizza around behind him in a striped shirt and bowtie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi dragging a pizza around behind him in a striped shirt and bowtie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-recommend-id="image://cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi dragging a pizza around behind him in a striped shirt and bowtie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We already knew that <em>Mario Kart World</em> would include new outfits for multiple characters, but we now have a little more insight into how you unlock them. Throughout the open world, you’ll find different meals that will unlock new threads based on the food you take to go. For example, if you eat sushi, you’ll unlock traditional Japanese clothing. Once you chow down, you’ll be able to access these costumes in the character select screen.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-recommend-id="image://76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of wall riding in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of wall riding in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-recommend-id="image://76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of wall riding in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> adds a few new maneuvers to give you more options while racing. You can jump to avoid incoming obstacles, drive on walls, and rewind to get a second shot at jumping to an alternate route. However, your rivals will continue to drive normally while you rewind, so it has its drawbacks.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-recommend-id="image://d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shy Guy riding around in Free Roam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shy Guy riding around in Free Roam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-recommend-id="image://d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shy Guy riding around in Free Roam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the 24-player races are the big central draw of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the game is including modes that let you race with friends or play in solitude. Time Trials are returning, and will include ghost data from other players for you to compete against as you try to get a new personal best time. VS Race lets you customize a race’s ruleset, and supports up to four teams so several players can group up together for a collective score. Battle modes Coin Runners and Balloon Battle are also returning, letting you duke it out with other racers. Free Roam is exactly what it sounds like, and lets you drive around the game’s open world to explore, solve puzzles, and find collectibles. While you race and explore the world, you’ll be able to use a photo mode to take cool screenshots of all your sick tricks and neat discoveries.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-recommend-id="image://01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-recommend-id="image://01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of the appeal of Free Roam is getting to zone out and ride around without the pressures of racing, and you can play it with friends and drive around the open world together. Using the Switch 2's chat button will allow you to voice chat as you ride around, and you can take photos together with the photo mode. And whether you’re Free Roaming with friends or alone, it seems the world is packed with things to discover, including P Switches that start challenges, as well as special hidden coins, panels to activate (for some as of yet unknown purpose), and more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
