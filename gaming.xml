		<p>While the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has been the runaway winner of the generation, running laps around Xbox for the last few years, it’s been a pretty bumpy ride. Some of that has been out of Sony’s hands – the chip shortages and the general economy, for example – but you do have to wonder about some of the choices they’ve made along the way, where even someone with the most basic grasp of the video game market could have told them they aren’t making the best decisions.</p>
<p>Outside of the PS5, Sony’s other hardware plans haven’t panned out, for various reasons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> is a great headset, but with gamers feeling the financial squeeze, it’s just priced too high to be appealing. That wouldn’t be so bad if there were great reasons to save up for one, but outside a handful of exclusives – literally, you can count them on one hand’s fingers – there’s been no sign of first party support, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the PC adapter</a> released last month feels like they’re ready to give up on it.</p>



<p>Then there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/playstation-portal-review/">PlayStation Portal</a>, a truly wonderful idea that should let you stream PlayStation games anywhere you want for £200, and grab some of that juicy Switch market in the process. Except it’s not quite that simple, because even when playing within a good home network, we’ve seen the remote play stumble and interrupt gameplay, so how is it going to handle hotel or cafe Wi-Fi? A lot of this could be improved if you could just stream from PlayStation Plus, hooking up to Sony’s optimised streaming servers, and being able to tap into the full PS Plus library.</p>
<p>Sure the Portal sold out as soon as it went on sale, but that’s pretty much inevitable with tech these days.&nbsp;There are plenty of units available now, but is anyone buying them?</p>

<p>But the bigger problems seem to be on the game development side, where Sony’s decision to chase after the live service big bucks has stumbled, staggered, lurched forward and picked up a big of momentum, and then fallen flat on its face.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog’s full The Last of Us multiplayer spin-off was in development for years, having split off from The Last of Us Part II, and grown and grown in scope and ambition… but then someone pointed out they would <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">need a full team to support the game as a live service</a> and Naughty Dog did not have the staff to do that. So they cancelled it.</p>
<p>Just… how? How did it get that far before someone did a headcount at Naughty Dog? Before someone pointed out just how many people have to work at Epic and Bungie to support their games? To make it worse, the game had been teased and mentioned for years since the launch of The Last of Us Part 2, it wasn’t a secret, so fans were really let down. And let’s be honest, those fans basically just wanted a revamped Factions mode from TLOU with prettier graphics, TLOU 2’s enhanced gameplay and maybe a bit better progression to keep them hooked.</p>

<p>But then came Helldivers 2, the sequel that no one asked for but that turned out to be exactly the game everyone wanted. A deservedly massive hit with Sony selling the PC version across the globe, including in regions where you could not make a Sony account… and then they<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/"> told PC players</a> they would need a Sony account to continue playing, were forced to backtrack on that demand, but have still cut off unsupported regions. The game is still great, though, and shows exactly how finding a small niche and going big with it can be a major success.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, which is basically the opposite of that. It’s an excellent, colourful, multiplayer hero shooter that cost money to play. Going up against the biggest game in the world, an excellent, colourful, multiplayer hero shooter called Overwatch which is now free. Oh, and there’s also just Fortnite, Warframe, Valorant, that Marvel hero shooter that’s about to come along. They’re all free to play, and the only time you can really beat free is if you’re first.</p>

<p>Having a price tag worked for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> because it’s in a market where paying up front is still common, but Concord turned up to the party much too late, and you have to wonder why was it made and supported more and more and more strongly by Sony over the last few years? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Taking it offline and reworking it</a>, presumably into an F2P model,</p>
<p>While all that has been going on, Destiny 2 has been coming to its natural end. The expansion, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">The Final Shape,</a> was the perfect conclusion to a story that has been running for ten years. A story that has had fans gripped with mysteries and lore which have taken a decade to pay off, The Final Shape ends with massive battle ripped from Avengers Endgame and a beautiful cut scene that will have had a lot of year one players crying.</p>
<p>Then they announced the game would continue and many people really did not care. Why would they, after investing ten years in that story, building and building to epic and most importantly, satisfying conclusion, players are finding it hard to be engaged with what appears to be a story tacked on to the end of the game just so they have something to sell. And at the same time, Bungie are barrelling down the path of trying to make a big budget PvPvE extraction shooter reboot of the early 90s FPS <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/bungie-announce-some-kind-of-marathon-remake/">Marathon</a> – a game that by it’s very nature will speak to a very different audience than Destiny’s PvE fans.</p>

<p>Sony’s live service ambitions are feeling on shaky ground, but what’s even more confusing is that they’re not making use of what they already have. Why not bring back Killzone, for example? Now I’m not pretending that it’s no work at all, but they could bring back Killzone’s multiplayer, revive classic maps and modes, release it as F2P on PC and PS5 and make money off Battle Passes and cosmetic DLC. We’re seeing the arena shooter still has some clout,</p>
<p>Oh, and one other word: SOCOM.</p>
<p>At the very least, this week has given us a reminder of just what made PlayStation so good in the first place. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot is a pure delight</a>, it’s playful and fun, and it’s a single player game – something that Sony built the whole PS4 generation on. Now, we’re not going to tell Sony to never do live service or multiplayer, and there are success stories, but it’s pretty clear that they’ve made some poor decisions along the way, gone too big and tried to go too quickly, when smaller and steadier would have been safer and worked better in the long term.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-pc-update-to-remove-iconic-licensed-song.974082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-pc-update-licensed-song<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>update is scheduled to arrive next week, and it's set to remove one of the game's most iconic licensed songs, replacing it with an original composition.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Remedy reveals that David Bowie's famous song "Space Oddity" will be removed from the PC versions of the original&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>on September 10th. That'll hold across the Steam, Epic, and GOG versions of the game.</p>
<p>"Space Oddity" will be replaced by "a new original song by Petri Alanko" by the name of "Strange Moons". As a reminder, Petri Alanko is a composer who's worked with Remedy on a number of projects, including&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/control"><em>Control</em></a>, and, of course, last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/alan-wake-2">horror sequel</a>&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-david-bowie-removal.jpg?itok=BQcFJjGw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-david-bowie-removal.jpg?itok=2GRm6qcd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David Bowie's iconic "Space Oddity" is being removed from&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>next week.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this removal only applies to the original PC version of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em>; it doesn't affect 2021's&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, which presumably still holds the rights to use the song for a while yet.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're playing the original&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>on Xbox 360, then you'll still be able to hear "Space Oddity" there, too. After all, it's not like Remedy or Warner can physically remove the rights to the song from your Xbox 360 disc, right?</p>
<p>Video games regularly run into problems due to the expiry of music licensing agreements, including&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<p>Back in 2017, it was announced that the digital and physical versions of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-to-be-pulled-from-stores-due-to-music-licensing-issues">would be pulled from stores</a> around the world due to music rights issues. The game subsequently <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1055512227623530496" rel="noopener" target="_blank">returned to stores in 2018</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-4-music-rights.jpg?itok=89cxyhpe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-4-music-rights.jpg?itok=qvhJhlcN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 4&nbsp;</em>have also run into music rights issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2018, it was also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 4&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updated-grand-theft-auto-iv-losing-lot-of-music-due-to-license-agreements-expiring">lose a number of its music tracks</a> due to expiring license agreements. Many of those songs were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-iv-may-be-bringing-back-removed-songs">subsequently restored in a later update</a>, although that update brought some woes of its own.</p>
<p>Again, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, you won't need to worry about "Space Oddity"; it'll still play over the game's closing credits. However, if you're playing the original game on PC, you'll hear Alanko's composition instead.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-shattered-space-save/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-year-later-will-shattered-space-save-starfield.974079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-shattered-space-save/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been a year to the day since Starfield was released on Xbox and PC, taking the world by storm but landing a relatively mixed reception after a few days in the open. It was in development for a staggering amount of time, and when it finally hit the market, it wavered in its ability to live up to the hype.</p>



<p>The game is now one year old, and the first major expansion for the title – Shattered Space – will be released at the end of the month. With that in mind, it’s a critical time to take a look at the game’s performance and determine if anyone is still playing Starfield.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lost-in-the-stars">Lost In The Stars</h2>



<p>At first blush, Starfield looks impressive. It offers a vast universe bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore, along with an immersive, lengthy story, plenty of side quests, factions, and intuitive, innovative ship-crafting mechanics. One of the key selling points of Starfield was that the story unravels in a way that <strong>technically </strong>gives it infinite replay value.</p>



<p>But once you start digging, you find a plethora of copied and pasted content, baseless side missions, forgettable factions and bosses, and a gameplay ‘reset loop’ that quickly becomes stale and repetitive.</p>



<p>In the months that followed Starfield’s release, Bethesda Game Studios became slow to release any new content for the game. Even minor updates were spread out across a gap-laden cadence, and it has taken an entire year for the team to ship Shattered Space, an expansion that was marketed before Starfield was released.</p>



<p>With that being said, is there much of a market ready to receive Shattered Space, or has everyone long since moved on?</p>



<h2 id="h-mixed-numbers">Mixed Numbers</h2>



<p>Using Steam as a representative example of Starfield’s player count, it looks as though the game isn’t faring too badly. It had 7,311 players in the game at the time of writing, which isn’t awful for a single-player game a year after it was released.</p>



<p>But Baldur’s Gate 3, which was released a month before Starfield, has 68,586.</p>



<p>Elden Ring, which was boosted by the June release of Shadow of the Erdtree, has 57,600.</p>



<p>Fallout 4, which was released in 2014 by Bethesda Game Studios, has 16,180 players exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland – <strong>ten years</strong> after launch. </p>



<p>It’s important to stress that <strong>many </strong>players will still be locked in on Xbox Series X|S, but it’s near impossible to get those numbers.</p>



<p>One of the biggest boons in the Bethesda world is the extent of modding opportunities that bleed into the tech titan’s games. On Nexus Mods, Fallout 4 has 61,700 mods, and Skyrim has almost 100,000. Even 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas has 35,000 mods.</p>



<p>Starfield has just 496 mods available a year down the line, despite BGS pushing out official mod support several months ago. Even Fallout 76, which doesn’t <strong>officially </strong>support mods, has more than 2,000 files on Nexus Mods. I get that it’s tough to code mods for Starfield, but that’s another issue.</p>



<p>If we look at the sentiment around streaming, we can see that, at the time of publishing, Starfield had just <strong>62 live viewers </strong>on Twitch. That’s down from an all-time high of 522,021. By comparison, Fallout 4 had around 2,000 live viewers. If we look at some space-faring competitors to Starfield, we can see that they’re all doing better than Bethesda’s title:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elite: Dangerous – 184</li>



<li>No Man’s Sky – 517</li>



<li>Star Citizen – 4,705</li>
</ul>



<p>According to Google, the search volume for Starfield bottomed out at the start of 2024 and has never picked back up again.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-dlc-outlook">The DLC Outlook</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shattered Space <strong>could </strong>do something to revive Starfield, but I doubt it’ll be anything major. In recent trailers, Bethesda Game Studios made it more of a priority to showcase the arrival of an in-game vehicle than it did the impending release of Shattered Space. Players were excited for a faster way to get across the game’s many planets – but Shattered Space isn’t turning heads.</p>



<p>Historically, Bethesda Game Studios’ DLC game has been sublime, especially in Skyrim and Fallout 3, way back in the day. Fallout 4 had some solid expansions, and Fallout 76 has been getting better for almost six years. But I’m just not feeling the same level of excitement from the community for Starfield’s Shattered Space expansion.</p>



<p>Those other games had expansions released <strong>faster </strong>than this, so perhaps that’s a problem. </p>



<p>I’m willing to give Shattered Space a run, even if I completed Starfield <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-one-month-later/">and then never looked back</a>. I can’t imagine it’ll do much to bring many players back into the fold, but it should be entertaining for a few hours at least, and given that I bought the Constellation Edition, I want to get the most from my money.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-next-update-wipe-night/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare%E2%80%99s-major-update-is-so-big-a-%E2%80%98wipe-will-be-100-necessary%E2%80%99.974076/</guid>

<p>At Gamescom, I sat down with the team at MADFINGER to learn about the next evolution for Gray Zone Warfare. The team has been preparing a super-sized content update that has just been revealed in full, at the heart of which sits the ‘day/night’ mechanics. This long-awaited feature plunges Lamang into darkness, altering the game state in many ways.</p>



<p>That’s only scratching the surface of this update, though. MADFINGER’s Rick Lagnese advised me that a wipe is ‘100% necessary’ because of all the new features and mechanics being implemented, which means that once you’ve installed the update, you’ll find your account reset.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-am-the-night">I Am The Night</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare emerged earlier this year to considerable success, hitting more than 800,000 sales in just a few days. It won players over with gorgeous visuals and an open-world approach to the extraction shooter formula, despite the team being adamant that it’s not <strong>strictly </strong>an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>There’s plenty in the GZW pipeline, I’ve come to learn. As I sat down with the guys at Gamescom, I was presented with exclusive live footage of the new update, checking out how darkness impacted the world of Lamang. To survive at night, you’ll need to have your wits about you and plenty of equipment: night-vision goggles, flashlights, tracer rounds, and other tactical devices like lasers.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>very </strong>realistic. In designing the night cycle, the team has gone so far as to replicate the Southeast Asian sky, matching up constellations you’d see in the real world in the game. They’ve also tweaked how the AI behaves at night, with soldiers sleeping, taking reduced patrols, and using their own aids like flashlights when needed.</p>



<p>Oh, and the squad is adding a series of night-only quests that’ll force you into that less comfortable environment.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-better">Getting Better</h2>



<p>MADFINGER has boosted the world of Lamang in this update, deploying more points of interest that add a little backstory to the region, and the in-game economy has been ‘rebalanced’.</p>



<p>This means rewards, prices, loot, AI equipment, vendor stocks, and progression have all been addressed. This overhaul is why ‘a wipe will be 100% necessary’, Rick Lagnese said. With this update comes high-value loot, boosted loot density, and various other elements like stash cases, faction chat in the wider world, streamer mode, and even an emote system.</p>



<p>Movement mechanics have been tweaked or added, such as prone leaning and diagonal sprinting, and the team has worked tirelessly to address some of the biggest issues in Gray Zone Warfare:</p>



<ul>
<li>AI being overpowered</li>



<li>‘Deafening’ helicopters</li>



<li>Long helicopter wait times</li>



<li>Rubber-banding</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, all this is just a taste of what’s coming in the next Gray Zone Warfare update. If you’ve not yet picked the game up, consider investing in it on PC – you won’t regret it.</p>

			<p>Even though Rockstar Games only released a single Grand Theft Auto VI to date, there's a lot of information floating around regarding the next entry in the series, and most of it can now be checked out in a very convenient way thanks to the hard work of a dedicated fan.</p>
<p>The GTA VI Document version 1.5 was released online earlier this week, providing an in-depth look at the game, the very first trailer released last year, all the leaks that have occurred so far, and more. You can check out the latest version of the document by going <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usHpd-r-dllDIlMj6rBWxCCLwy4SgRyM/view">here.</a></p>
<p>It has been some time since we have heard anything about Grand Theft Auto VI from Rockstar Games, but the lack of information definitely hasn't impacted the excitement surrounding the game, which is only getting bigger as we get closer to the late 2025 release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/">confirmed</a> by Take-Two a few months back. It's not just players who are excited about the game's release but also the video game industry, as GTA VI is expected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, whose performance on the market can have a huge impact on the entire industry.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is now in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Peter Molyneux, a veteran game developer responsible for games such as Fable, Dungeon Keeper, and Theme Park, spoke out about what he thinks people can expect from the games industry over the next few years and what developments will be made to keep it alive. The main answer was AI. When<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-will-games-be-in-25-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> asked by Eurogamer</a> where he thinks the world of video games will be in two years time, he mentioned that AI will most likely be heavily used at this point.</p>
<p>"AI is going to be a real game changer. There will come a time where AI will be used to create huge parts of a game - AI-generated characters, animations, dialogue, VO, there is so much that AI will be able to tackle." While this is a genuine possibility, it spells danger for those who are in the games industry at present, as it would leave their jobs dangling in the balance. What will happen to those responsible for animating characters when AI takes over? His statement continues with, "You will be able to, for example, create a game from one single prompt such as 'make a battle royale set on a pirate ship,' and your AI will go and do that for you."</p>
<p>With how controversial Peter Molyneux has been in the past, these responses don't surprise many people. In addition to adding AI into the game industry mix, he also went on to explain his thoughts on how Hollywood will perceive video games and says that Hollywood is "going to continue to be fascinated with games and keep on coming for more game stories and narrative." We've seen the Fallout TV show, The Last of US TV show, the Super Mario Movie, and recently announced the Minecraft movie.</p>
<p>While Peter Molyneux commented on AI during this interview with Eurogamer, he wasn't the only veteran games developer to comment, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/">Shinji Mikami,</a> founder of Tango Gameworks, also explained how AI will make a difference in the game industry. Looking into the far future, Mikami mentioned "there's not a whole lot that can be changed as far as backgrounds, but animations and stuff like that could all be, in 25 years, completely AI-generated. And so the importance of the creation of backgrounds and actual animations, I feel that there's going to be a much bigger gap than there is now. That's one of the things that is a bit daunting."</p>
<p>AI has accelerated from janky-looking art prompts on Dall-E to fully-fledged videos and imagery that borders reality. For the most part, it is still easy to clock out what is AI and what isn't, but who knows how fast AI will continue to evolve?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber and Focus'&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is out now, and if you've already picked it up and played all the way through to the credits sequence, you may notice a rather lovely and unexpected tribute nestled there.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fa0og5/john_totalbiscuit_bain_homage_in_the_w40k_space/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Tiucaner</a>, the credits feature an "In Memoriam" section, which pays tribute to John "TotalBiscuit" Bain. The section also seemingly features several other staffers who died during the game's production, including casting and voice director Roman Palmov and technical writer Andrey Kozyrev, among others.</p>
<p>Just in case you need a reminder, TotalBiscuit, also known as The Cynical Brit, was a very well-known figure within the gaming industry. He's perhaps best known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cynicalbrit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his YouTube channel</a>, where he drew attention to lesser-known indie games, and the Co-Optional Podcast, on which he served as one of the hosts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit-tribute-tyranid.jpg?itok=nwofBWvU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit-tribute-tyranid.jpg?itok=ZShGyXnd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>features a touching TotalBiscuit tribute in its credits.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, in 2014, Bain was diagnosed with cancer, undergoing treatment that would ultimately prove unsuccessful. In 2015, Bain's cancer was sadly deemed inoperable, and he was given around two to three years to live.</p>
<p>That prediction sadly proved to be correct; Bain passed away in 2018. He had, at that point, already retired from content creation on YouTube, although he was still hosting the Co-Optional podcast alongside his wife Genna.</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s mention of Bain in the credits reminds us that he's no longer with us, of course, but it also gives us a chance to honor and celebrate his legacy, which includes a 2011 video shining a spotlight on the original&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>. You can check that out here.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you might expect, the followup to 2011's third-person hack-and-shooter hybrid <i>Space Marine</i>.</p>
<p>It returns to the story of Captain Demetrian Titus, although he's a captain no longer; stripped of his rank after being accused of heresy, Titus must prove his worth to the Empire by putting a stop to a Tyranid invasion on an Imperial planet.</p>
<p>Saber and Focus have promised that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>will feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">no microtransactions</a>; although the game will have a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap">post-launch roadmap</a> that adds new features, all gameplay additions, including new modes and features, will be free for all players.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003330" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/9n9pczwhvp2l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Calm down, it’s OK, this guide will detail the best guns you should use to slay your enemies in Space Marine 2.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-recommend-id="image://51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-recommend-id="image://51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h31123"><a id=""></a><strong>Plasma Incinerator</strong></h3><p>The Plasma Incinerator is arguably one of the best guns to use in the game. Even though its firepower isn’t the highest, you can charge it up to do a significant amount of damage. Its overall stats balance it out to be an ideal rifle, and since it doesn’t have a magazine, you don’t have to reload it.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-recommend-id="image://cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-recommend-id="image://cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h31124"><a id=""></a><strong>Heavy Bolt Rifle</strong></h3><p>The Heavy Bolt Rifle is a light machine gun. Its firepower is surprisingly low for its heft, but it makes up for it in speed and range, which is ideal when you find yourself fighting large hordes (which happens a lot). Out of all the weapons you can carry, this one has the largest magazine size too.</p><figure id="" data-id="c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-recommend-id="image://c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-recommend-id="image://c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h31125"><a id=""></a><strong>Melta Rifle</strong></h3><p>The Melta Rifle is one of the strongest weapons to use in the game. It has the highest firepower, and can kill anything within two rounds. This weapon is essentially a shotgun flamethrower that’ll melt anything you shoot at. But the catch is the Melta Rifle has horrible range and reload speed, so you’ll need to be mindful of that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-recommend-id="image://c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-recommend-id="image://c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h31126"><a id=""></a><strong>Plasma Pistol</strong></h3><p>The Plasma Pistol is a miniature version of the Plasma Incinerator. It has the second-highest firepower out of all the pistols, and can be charged up to inflict a lot of damage at once. This pistol perfectly pairs up with the Melta Rifle, if you’re looking for a one-two combo.</p><figure id="" data-id="85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-recommend-id="image://85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1162" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-recommend-id="image://85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1162" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h31127"><a id=""></a><strong>Heavy Bolt Pistol</strong></h3><p>The Heavy Bolt Pistol is a great weapon. It has the highest firepower of all the secondary weapons, and an incredibly high reload rate. If you find yourself surrounded, this is a perfect fallback weapon to use.

It can be used for light or heavy attacks, and it is great for any situation you find yourself in, and it looks like…a sword! Out of all the melee weapons in the game, it’s the most well-rounded one. Except for the sides. They’re very sharp.</p><figure id="" data-id="b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-recommend-id="image://b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-recommend-id="image://b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h31129"><a id=""></a><strong>Thunder Hammer</strong></h3><p>Nothing screams <em>40K</em> like a giant hammer swinging at your enemies. The Thunder Hammer is extremely satisfying to use, and packs a serious punch. It’s great for clearing out hordes, but the downside is how long it takes to swing. When using this, be prepared to take a hit or two.</p><hr><p>These are some of our favorite weapons to use while playing <em>Warhammer 40:000 Space Marine 2</em>.

                <p>It's fair to say that Concord is one of the biggest flops in recent gaming history, with the hero shooter shutting down after just two weeks of existence. However, despite that, it seems that the game will live on through a side story in Prime Video's video-game-themed TV show Secret Level, which releases on December 10.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced back in August during Gamescom, Secret Level is an anthology series that will feature animated short stories set in the world of various games and gaming franchises, including God of War, The Outer Worlds 2, and Warhammer 40K. Concord was announced as one of the 15 franchises involved in the project, and a source <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" rel="nofollow ">told IGN</a> that the game will remain a part of Secret Level.</p><p dir="ltr">Secret Level will also feature new stories in franchises that haven't seen a fresh entry in some time, such as Mega Man and Unreal Tournament. A brief moment in the trailer led us to think that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/were-thinking-its-keanu-reeves-in-secret-level-upcoming-armored-core-episode/1100-6526013/">Keanu Reeves might star</a> in the Armored Core episode, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. The John Wick star was recently revealed as the voice of Shadow in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-adds-keanu-reeves-as-voice-of-shadow/1100-6522667/">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Concord remains unclear, with one of the developers of the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-dev-thanks-fans-for-their-support-but-admits-none-of-us-know-whats-next/1100-6526291/">outright stating</a> that "none of us know what's next." Prior to the game's shutdown on September 6, reports suggested that players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-players-are-repeatedly-killing-their-characters-to-get-a-platinum-trophy/1100-6526260/">killing themselves in the game on purpose</a> to try to gain the platinum trophy before the curtain fell.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lous-lagoon-preview-new-cozy-obsession</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lou%E2%80%99s-lagoon-preview-%E2%80%93-a-new-cozy-obsession.974010/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lous-lagoon-preview-new-cozy-obsession<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes low stakes vibing with a sense of progression is all you want out of a game. To chill yet effect change all the same. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is the next up and coming game to let you do just that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is obviously its own game, but it’s also got quite the interesting mixture. Part <em>Animal Crossing</em>, part <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, part flying game, and add in a dash of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> -- yes, really – and you’ve got <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your uncle has disappeared and you’ve turned up to figure out what happened to him and to rebuild his delivery business at the same time. Set in an archipelago of islands full of mystery, you’ll be building up and connecting people from all around.</p>
<p>The throughline of the game is the mystery of what happened to your uncle, but the meat of the game will be rebuilding, repairing, and improving the various islands and the inhabitants you meet along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collecting resources is very <em>No Man’s Sky</em>-like in that you’re “vacuuming” things up with your Swirler 2000, like wood debris and metal parts, to then use to craft things later. Also, what else are islands but a planet analogue with the sea and air between standing in for space? Alright, reaching a bit here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those resources can then be used to repair or build structures, repair stairs to reach new places on an island ,and pretty much anything and everything in-between. You can even craft your own decorations and furniture. There's cooking and a science station, too.</p>
<p>The most unique thing you can repair and upgrade, however, is your plane that's unlocked after you repair it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the plane isn’t simply a quick travel system, as you will be actively flying it around the archipelago of Lou’s Lagoon. The brief time I had with it showed a simple control set that will be difficult to master if you’re wanting to challenge yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timed challenges can be found throughout the sky that see you flying through rings. You’ll need some serious practice to complete some of them, let alone set a good time.</p>
<p>With all of those tools in hand, that’s more or less the basis of the game. You go around collecting resources, doing quests for people you meet along the way, find and upgrading more things along the way so you can explore even more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m always a sucker for a game where I can collect some sort of resource or do a quest to then upgrade some sort of town or building. That tangible result of my effort that has a permanent physical affect on the game world is never not satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is full of things like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a game of exploration, growth, and connection set in a beautiful backdrop. There's a mystery to uncover and plenty of secrets within many of the islands to find as well. You can go where you want, when you want, at your own pace -- comfort gaming you can curl up with any day.</p>
<p>I think this game will speak to anyone looking for their next cozy game fix. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> smartly mashes together a few systems with its unique island hopping world to make for a compelling game.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Lou’s Lagoon<em> was previewed at PAX West 2024.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/street-fighter-6-sales-top-4-million-around-the-world.974007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone around the world, around fifteen months after the game was initially released.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1831814865297489924" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has sold more than four million units globally, which presumably counts across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The studio says that updates and new stuff for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>will continue, as "more content" and "more events" are on the way for the game. Given that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-3-million">crossed the three million threshold back in January</a>, that means it's shifted another million units in the last eight or nine months, which isn't too bad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=VZAO-jhP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=chYcewUM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has broken another big sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-sales-2-million">sold two million copies</a> within its first month or so on sale, while&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>had sold around 2.47 million copies by the time of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sells-247-million-copies-drives-capcoms-overwhelming-financial-results">Capcom's September 2023 financial results</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's difficult to compare fighting franchise sales directly; fighting games are a fairly niche genre in the grand scheme of things, and each franchise within the genre arguably has its own audience as well, although there will naturally be some crossover.</p>
<p>Still, four million sales for the latest entry in a pretty major series well over a year after its initial release suggests that there's still a market for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which Capcom will no doubt be happy about. Those might not be&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million"><em>Resident Evil Village</em>-level sales</a>, but hey - there's still time!</p>

<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>may already be well over a year old, but the game's not resting on its laurels. It's still getting regular DLC injections;&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>legend Terry Bogard is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/4616839976807963593" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the game's latest addition</a>, and other DLC fighters include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-akuma-release-date">Akuma</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-street-fighter-6-dlc-character-ed-gets-release-date-and-gameplay-reveal">Ed</a>, and new character <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-reveals-release-date-gameplay-trailer-for-disturbing-new-character-aki">A.K.I.</a>, to name but a few.</p>

But it was more than just an elaborate tech demo, and established the <em>Astro</em> franchise, previously a VR-exclusive, as a budding Sony first-party A-lister. Leading up to the release of the third game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, Team Asobi even added a countdown timer to the mission room in <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>for the September 6 launch. </p><p>That’s where players were able to wait ahead of actually being able to play <em>Astro Bot</em> and watch all of the little guys count down like it was New Year’s Eve 1999. It was a neat little easter egg that’s in keeping with the franchise’s dedication to celebrating PlayStation’s past and taking time to add little touches that make the whole thing feel extra special. </p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is out now on PlayStation 5 and I’m not alone in thinking it’s a strong frontrunner for GOTY and also one of the best 3D platformers ever. It’s full of whimsical little touches and dazzling set pieces, with levels that revolve around clever mechanics and make full use of the DualSense controller, from the haptic triggers to the speaker. It all gives playing the game the same tactile satisfaction of playing with toys in real life. </p><p>But the seeds of many of those ideas, including blowing onto the touch pad to to create wind gusts in the game, were there in <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, a short game not enough people played despite it being free with each of the over 60 million PS5s that have been sold so far. It only takes three hours to beat and will give you a nice taste of what to expect in <em>Astro Bot</em>. Plus, it will give you a point of reference to see how far the franchise has come in just four years, and a new appreciation for all of the novel ways the new game iterates on what Team Asobi experimented with before. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sheer level of joy the game produces makes it impossible to compare it to anything other than Mario's very best adventure. Astro is no longer a vector through which to reference PlayStation icons; he is a PlayStation icon." -- <em>Jordan Middler</em> [<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/astro-bot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>VG247 -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot only cares about fun, and I genuinely can't think of a single moment it made me wish something had been handled differently, tweaked to be easier, or expanded upon. It's just perfect." -- <em>Tom Orry</em> [<a href="https://www.vg247.com/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Eurogamer -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot is a really, really good 3D platformer. As is often the case with the blockbuster genres of yesteryear, it's always nice when someone busts another one of these out, particularly when they put in so much effort to make it satisfying, curious, lavish and pleasantly odd." -- <em>Christian Donlan</em> [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Inverse -- 10/10</h2><p>"More than anything, my time with Astro Bot is dominated by one word: surprise. There were moments that had my jaw on the floor, moments I cackled with glee, and even one or two where may have shed a tear. Astro Bot is everything that I love about video games — the potential they have to cause wonder and excitement, self-reflection, and, most importantly, fun." -- <em>Hayes Madsen</em> [<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot doesn't just deliver on the promise and potential displayed in PS5 pack-in demo Astro's Playroom, but soars above and beyond to serve up a near-perfect platformer to rival--and possibly surpass--the best of Super Mario's Mushroom Kingdom romps." -- <em>Matt Cabral</em> [<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/astro-bot-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 9/10</h2><p>"Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don't need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you'd expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it." --<em> Simon Cardy</em> [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Polygon -- No score</h2><p>"Sony has been reaching for something like Astro Bot since PlayStation launched 30 years ago in the age of Mario and Sonic. It has cycled through mascots like Crash, Jak, and Sackboy in its quest for a breezy family game that could hold its own with Nintendo’s best as well as mesh with Sony's cooler, tech-centric brand. Sony ended up settling for edgier cinematic action heroes instead, but deep in the consoles' soul, it felt like something was missing. Astro Bot--a dazzling, joyful game--is a celebration of all the failed attempts and quizzical detours Sony made on that quest. And it might also be the game to fill that hole at last." -- <em>Oli Welsh</em> [<a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/447564/astro-bot-review" rel="nofollow ">Full review</a>]</p>

<p><em>OMUT </em>is mechanically simple, lean and mean with the one goal of killing you as much as possible. It’s difficult, punishing, frustrating, tantalizing, alluring, cathartic, and glory-inducing all in one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll get into the combat and how it plays in the moment, but the best aspect of <em>OMUT </em>is that it’s a punishing game where you are going to die a whole lot that also respects your time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting a boss fight after a failure is instantaneous at the click of a button, which makes it easy to just try again, again, again, and again.</p>
<h2>OMUT Is A Boss Rush Demanding Perfection</h2>
<p><em>OMUT</em>’s nothing but bosses, 20 or so all told, so the name of the game is just figuring out their patterns and quirks. If you mow down the bosses perfectly, you could finish the game in probably 30 or so minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that I played for about 30 minutes and did not kill either of the two bosses I tried in my preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failure is immediate and fatal in <em>OMUT</em>, meaning that only perfection will see you succeed. If all goes well, you can probably clear out a boss in that one perfect attempt in about a minute or so.</p>
<p>If you can do that with any regularity for the first time, I’ll crown you the god gamer now myself. OMUT is hard as nails with little margin for error. There's a lot of dying, trial and error, and close calls until you get that one perfect run.</p>

Making a deal with this guy gives the kid his powers to come back to life and fight again.</figcaption></figure><p>From what I played, and I understand there may be upgrades and changes later in the game, I was equipped simply with a shotgun with three shells. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The shells replenish automatically quickly but there is a slight delay, so you’ll often find yourself in moments where you don’t have a shot ready when you need it. That means shots need to be strategic and thoughtful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movement in <em>OMUT </em>is like a 2D sidescroller action game, where you can just shoot and dash. The dash does give you some invulnerability, which you’ll need to time correctly to avoid death. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Shooting and dodging is really all you need to do to win but that’s like saying all you need to do to hit a bullseye is just pull back on the bowstring.</p>
<h2>OMUT's Boss Fights Are Simple But Exacting</h2>
<p>The first boss I fought was a floating demonic ball that was constantly trying to fall to the ground. In later stages of the fight, it would start shooting things out I would have to avoid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I hit it with a blast of the shotgun, I’d send it back up into the air. If it hit me or the ground at any point, it was game over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Juggling this guy with my measly three shotgun shells was a tall task. The projectiles the boss would send could knock my shells out of the air (or I could block them with a shot), which added another wrinkle to the sporadic movements the boss would make already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add onto that the increase in speed, and the fight had significant ramp ups to account for each step of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told it was either 12 or 16 shots to beat the boss and that at one point I was just one hit away from victory. I knew it at the time too and that didn’t make it any easier to step away when I had to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one thing I’ll hold onto is that when I ran into the PR person later that day, he said I was the closest to beating the boss of anyone that demoed the game that day. I knew I'd see him at an event later in the day and hoped <em>OMUT </em>would be there so I could get some more shots in at the boss, but it was never to be. I am happy to live in my own reality believing I got further than anyone else.</p>

<p>The second boss I saw was somehow more frustrating. A large fat naked? man just running at you left and right. Sometimes he changed up the speed, jumped at you, shoots out a projectile, or leaps forward.</p>
<p>This is the fight where you learn where the i-frames are in the dash. The boss has plenty of good animations and clues as to what’s coming next, you just have to be ready to react, so death never felt cheap.</p>
<p>I didn’t have as much time on this one, as I got so close on that first boss I was determined to beat it, but I was no less challenged or engaged with the mechanics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>OMUT Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>OMUT </em>is cleverly designed in a very meticulous way. The fewer mechanics and systems to engage with, the more glaring a potential problem will be, which thankfully <em>OMUT </em>had none in my brief time with the game.</p>
<p>With 18 or so bosses still left for me to see at some point in the future, I can’t wait to try all of their wackiness out. There’s no way I’m not seeing at least 1,000 deaths along the way.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>Season 4 is finally upon us, and it's bringing all kinds of goodies to the gloomy multiplayer dungeon-crawler, including a reworked map, a new boss, and plenty more.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2016590/view/4593196713079675998" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post announcing the new season's arrival</a>, developer and publisher Ironmace first notes that all characters have been reset for the start of this season, which is a fairly standard practice for Early Access games.</p>
<p>As for new features, the first one you're getting is a reworked version of the Ruins map, which also serves as a gateway to two more layers: the Crypt and the Inferno. As you've probably guessed, this season therefore also marks the return of three-layer dungeons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-4-ruins-map.jpg?itok=I3ZSSQq2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-4-ruins-map.jpg?itok=_iUNZXS6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>Season 4 has tons of new stuff for you to discover.</figcaption></figure><p>Other major highlights for this season include a new Spectral Knight boss for you and your friends to take on, as well as a new Dungeon Express system that lets you safely extract loot between dungeon layers.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to encounter new unique monsters, new models for several weapons and items, and more, so even if you think you know&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>inside out, you might want to head back in for this update.</p>
<p>The experience should now be easier on newer players, too; a new Tome of Knowledge has been added "to help with basic game information", and all classes have had their Starting Gear improved as well.</p>

<p>If you're interested in everything that's been added to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>as part of its fourth season, then you can check out the update's <a href="https://www.darkanddarker.com/news/74" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>is a multiplayer PvPvE dungeon-crawler in which your goal is to gather treasure, defeat monsters, and stay one step ahead of other groups of players, who'll be looking to take your treasure from you.</p>
<p>The game is one of several of its kind that have popped up in recent years. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-release-date"><em>Dungeonborne</em></a>&nbsp;and, of course,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, although the developers of that one have seemingly been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free">doing their best to alienate their community</a> of late.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only widescreen. No ultrawide for the moment, sadly. As and when they add support for ultrawide monitors, perhaps they should call it "ultramarinewide". Ha ha! Ha. Anyway, here's what's coming in the first round of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> patches.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saber Interactive's well-regarded battle-bludgeoner isn't fully on sale yet - the public release date is Monday 9th September, but certain Warhammerers have gotten early access by means of the blasphemous Chaotic rite of Preordering, may the God-Emperor shrive their souls. The Steam reactions so far seem broadly positive, but there are a few sore spots, including the absence of ultrawide support, which Saber have said they're <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update">working to add</a>.</p>
<p>There are also reports of crashing, for which publishers Focus have <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833">outlined some possible workarounds</a>. If you're experiencing crashes in general, consider deactivating any overlay software you're using such as Riva Tuner, Afterburner or NVIDIA's equivalent. If you're finding that the game crashes during the first cinematic, the publishers recommend updating to the latest version of Windows, verifying that the game is running on the correct GPU, and updating your GPU driver. And if you're running into an infinite loading bug when playing in multiplayer Operations, try restarting the game - it could be a networking issue, or it could be to do with getting kicked from your squad. </p>
<p>Personally, I think infinite loading bugs are appropriate to a game with infinitely loading bugs (Tyranid swarms). Ha ha! Ha. Anyway, here's what to do if your controller is refusing to work with the game: switch off Steam Input (Right click on game &gt; Properties &gt; Controller &gt; Disable Steam Input) and try plugging in your controller via USB.</p>
<p>If none of these bodges jump-start your Adeptus Astartes, you'll have to wait for some game updates, unfortunately. "We aim to fix all these issues in our first patches," Focus promise.</p>
<p>Crashes and the omission of ultrawide aren't the only bones Spice Margerine aficionadoes have to pick with Spruce Maureen 2. As passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2s-epic-games-client-on-steam-is-for-crossplay-confirms-publisher">Eurogamer</a>, there's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1f9ule0/space_marine_2_is_sitting_at_55_on_steam_due_to/">a stink on Reddit</a> about the "stealth installation of Epic Online Services" when you accept the game's EULA. </p>
<p>The installation of Epic's client is, in fact, mentioned in the EULA, and "was implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores", as Focus explain. "However, please be aware linking your Steam and Epic accounts is not required to enjoy the game. These features are entirely optional and will not affect your gameplay experience in any way."</p>
<p>Ugh, I need a final ghastly Warhammer pun to finish off this post. Something to do with Steam Tanks, maybe? The game tanking on Steam? Please go read Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a> while I consult the scriptorium and try to figure out the Warhammer 40K equivalent for a "review bomb".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
