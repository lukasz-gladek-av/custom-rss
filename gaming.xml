                <p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Heihachi_Mishima" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a> as the next DLC character for Tekken 8 and revealed that, for the first time in the series' history, a new chapter in the story mode will be added to the game. The extra story content will delve deeper into the ongoing feud between the Mishima and Kazama families.</p><p>The announcement was made during Evo 2024, at which Tekken 8 was a major attraction for players wanting to compete in high-level battles and viewers who want to see the best of the best duke it out in the fighting game. Heihachi is a fan-favorite character and one of the main antagonists of the Tekken series. His arrival follows <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Eddy_Gordo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, a DLC character that is already available, and <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Lidia_Sobieska" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who will be available widely from July 25. Heihachi is expected to be available in Fall 2024.</p><p>The story expansion, which builds on the ongoing 'The Dark Awakens' storyline, will be free, but publisher Bandai Namco has not yet confirmed when it will be available.</p><p>The other notable Tekken-related announcement is a collaboration with Nike, which includes in-game gear and the Nike Air Foamposite One Kazuya Mishima sneakers. A trailer that debuted during the Tekken finals at Evo 2024 showcased a variety of the game's characters sporting Nike sneakers and the iconic branding integrated into the stages.</p><p>The shoes, meanwhile, got a surprise drop and were available to purchase to Evo attendees via the SNKRS app. Bandai Namco indicated it would provide further details on the Nike x Tekken collaboration in the future.</p><p>Evo 2024 in Las Vegas officially became the largest in its history, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2024-is-officially-the-largest-esports-competition-ever/1100-6524526/" data-ref-id="1100-6524526">largest competitive tournament in esports history</a>. Over 10,224 players across 63 countries signed up for at least one of Evo's eight big tournaments and, alongside Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6, Mortal Kombat 1, Guilty Gear Strive, and King of Fighters XV were a few other big draws. The throwback game for 2024 was Street Fighter III: Third Strike. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-reputation-system-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher 3 PC players unite as modder 'Freak' has released an interesting new mod that restores the reputation concept in The Witcher 3.</p>
<p>Developer CD Projekt Red cut the reputation concept from the game when it was released back in 2015, but this new mod aims to restore that feature. When using the mod, player choices and behavior correspond to reputation points in different regions. The mod includes five reputation levels, including hated, disliked, neutral, liked, and respected. Each level corresponds to Geralt's reputation points range in the region. According to the modder, the different reputation levels will influence the corresponding region's economy. In addition, all bedding&nbsp;and bargaining activities are also affected.</p>
<p>What's cool here is that the outcome of certain quests based on Geralt's choices will affect Geralt's reputation in the region, gaining or losing. We've included an overview of the different reputation influences below:</p>
<p><em><strong>Hated</strong>: +30% buying price, -70% selling price, -20% bargain multiplier, -50% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Disliked</strong>: +15% buying price, -15% selling price, -10% bargain multiplier, -25% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Neutral</strong>: same with vanilla</em><br>
<em><strong>Liked</strong>: -15% buying price, +15% selling price, +10% bargain multiplier, +50% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Respected</strong>: -30% buying price, +30% selling price, +20% bargain multiplier, +100% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em></p>
<p>Those interested can download The Witcher 3 Reputation System Mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9383?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from here</a>. Be sure to follow the provided installation instructions. As expected, this mod is only available for the PC version of the game, and aside from working on the regular version of the game, it's also compatible with the next-gen version.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its DLCs are available worldwide now for PC and consoles.</p>

		<p>SNK headed to Evo 2024 with a surprise that no one had been expecting. During the incredibly popular annual fighting game competition, SNK dropped a trailer for SNK vs Capcom SVC Chaos, announcing a re-release of the 21 year old fighting game. Going further, SNK announced that the game is available to buy now on Steam, and it will be available from 22nd July on PS4, Switch and GOG.</p>
<p><iframe title="【ENG】SNK VS. CAPCOM SVC CHAOS｜Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JqjMpn6JrYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The SNK lineup of characters features the likes of Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard, and Mai Shiranui, Mars People, and Athena. Meanwhile, on the Capcom side there are the likes of Ryu, Chun-Li, Demitri, Zero, and Red Arremer. In total the game includes a roster of 36 characters to fight as.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442380/SNK_VS_CAPCOM_SVC_CHAOS/">SNK VS. CAPCOM SVC CHAOS is on Steam</a> for £16.95. The price is likely to be similar on the other platforms when it launches on those too. SNK vs Capcom SVC Chaos has had some updates applied to it including rollback netcode, and online lobbies for up to nine players. In online tournaments there are options for single elimination, double elimination, and round robin. There is a hitbox viewer too which shows every character’s collision areas. The gallery mode features 89 pieces of artwork.</p>

<p>SNK vs Capcom SVC Chaos first released in 2003 for PS2, Xbox, and Neo Geo. It did not have the best reception critically, averaging a score of 56 on Metacritic.</p>

            <p>Netflix has just dropped a new teaser for Arcane: League of Legends' second – and final – season.</p>
<p>Whilst it's barely a minute long, the trailer offers a peek at a "stealth mission" and shows how "Zaun's finest [...] makes sneaking back into your lab look good".</p>
<p>You can check it out in the video embedded below:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">Arcane may be ending with its second season</a>, but Riot Games is planning more projects with the show's talented animation studio Fortiche, the developer has now said.</p>
<p>"Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and our partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," co-creator Christian Linke said in a <a href="https://x.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1800543519725297679">developer update video last month</a>.</p>
<p>"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with the second season."</p>
<p>As Tom reported at the time, the show's upcoming second season has taken another three years to put together, and it was hoped its story would continue on further. There's still the possibility of another Arcane-style series set elsewhere within its universe, perhaps, but fans should prepare themselves for the show's overall series finale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">when new episodes arrive this November</a> on Netflix.</p>

            <p>Stormind Games has shared a ten-minute teaser for its upcoming horror, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-quiet-place-the-road-aheads-new-gameplay-footage-faithfully-recreates-the-tension-found-in-the-films?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN</a> captured ten minutes of hitherto unseen gameplay in which, on Day 119, the player fights to escape through the air ducts of an old building. It is dark, atmospheric, and absolutely terrifying in equal measure.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-shows-off-its-stealthy-single-player-horror-in-new-trailer">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a> was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-is-a-new-single-player-story-driven-horror-game-based-on-the-film">announced back in October 2021</a> and is the work of Stormind Games - the studio behind 2018's Clock-Tower-inspired pursuit horror Remothered: Tormented Fathers.</p>
<p>"In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, experience the harrowing journey of Alex, a young college student suffering from asthma and struggling to survive the end of the world alongside her boyfriend, Martin," the description teases.</p>
<p>"But the nightmarish creatures stalking the land aren’t the only threat she’ll have to contend with as she travels through the ruins of civilisation in search of a safe haven for herself and her family."</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn't have a firm release date yet, but it's currently expected to launch later this year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <p>A "leaked" trailer of Guilty Gear Strive's fourth season has popped up online.</p>
<p>Initially, the video was seemingly stumbled upon as a live, if unlisted, upload on YouTube. As soon as the news spread, however, the video was swiftly marked private… but not before about a dozen people uploaded it to their own channels, and many others grabbed a handful of informative screenshots.</p>
<p>The news below may include spoilers, <strong>so please only proceed</strong> if you're happy to have the surprises ruined!</p>

<p>According to the screenshots, Guilty Gear Strive Season 4 boasts new stages, an exclusive new colour, as well as the all-new "Team of 3" mode.</p>
<p>We also saw a number of new and guest characters, too: fan-favourite Dizzy – she's now a Queen – Venom, newbie Unika, and Cyberpunk Edgerunners' Lucy.</p><p>Wes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guilty-gear-strive-review-finally-a-guilty-gear-for-everyone">gave Guilty Gear Strive a recommended badge in his review</a> of the game's original release, and last year, it joined the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guilty-gear-strive-arrives-on-game-pass-next-week">library on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>"I've never been able to get into a Guilty Gear game before. I love fighting games. I love Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, Marvel vs. Capcom and Tekken, Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter, but Guilty Gear has always remained just out of reach," Wes wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Strive extends a helping hand, one I have gripped, firmly. And I have no intention of letting go."</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-fresh-shadow-x-sonic-generations-levels-in-new-teaser">Sega unveiled our first look at two new Shadow x Sonic Generations levels</a>, delving into the Sonic nemesis' past.</p>
<p>As with the original Sonic Generations, the new separate Shadow campaign will reimagine stages from Shadow's past. So far, we've seen the Space Colony level, inspired by Sonic Adventure 2's Final Chase. Now, in a new teaser video comparing old and new, two more stages have been revealed based on zones from Sonic Heroes and 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

            <p>Silent Hill: The Short Message developer Hexadrive is developing a new horror game, Niraya of ■■.</p>
<p>I have no idea if that "■■" is permanent or merely obscuring the final word until we get closer to the release, but an announcement teaser – which boasts the dubious honour of having one of the most disturbing cinematic openings I've ever seen – says it's currently slated for Q4 2025, so it may be a while yet until we know more.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="『■■ノニラヤ』アナウンストレイラー / &quot;Niraya of ■■&quot; Announce trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GitrLzD_89U?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>The teaser begins with a news report detailing how "a large number of bodies", including children, were discovered at a temple. At the same time, a huge hand with inhumanly long fingers is caressing the face of a dead child. So that's nice.</p>
<p>Then we see a little of the gameplay, which has a very retro/PS1-esque presentation faintly reminiscent of the Fatal Frame games. It's a significant departure from the hyper-real graphics of The Short Message.</p>
<p>"Niraya of ■■ is a Japanese horror game inspired by the Buddhist beliefs," the Steam description explains.</p>
<p>"The game focuses on a unique system where players 'avoid' the attacks of various monsters. This, combined with the fear of exploring eerie environments and solving puzzles, is a major draw of the game.</p>
<p>"In this game, the protagonist is cast into a mysterious realm unknown to the modern world and must attempt to escape. Players will guide the protagonist through unknown areas, solving hidden puzzles to progress. However, as mentioned, the exploration is filled with terrifying experiences, including strange phenomena and sudden monster attacks."</p>
<p>Right now, it looks as though the horror game is only coming to PC via Steam, although there's plenty of time for that to change, of course.</p>
<p>"I suspect that anyone who can relate to Anita's fictional experiences from a real-life perspective will have one of two polarising responses to Silent Hill: The Short Message: deep outrage, or deep admiration," I wrote in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message review</a>, giving it three out of five stars.</p>
<p>"For me – someone who can, unfortunately, relate to some of the darker themes expressed in The Short Message – it's the latter. Despite its inelegant delivery and high-school drama framing, Anita's story, if clumsy at times, is impactful, thoughtful, and – perhaps most importantly of all – hopeful.</p>
<p>"No, it may not be the Silent Hill game many of us were expecting; it may not even be the Silent Hill game some people want. But even with that infuriating chase sequence, I'm very glad it exists."</p>
<p>In related Silent Hill news, Silent Hill 2's original creators <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-producer-says-the-original-japanese-team-wanted-to-update-with-drastic-changes">"didn't want to make the same thing again" when it came to Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, causing Remake developer Bloober Team to push back on some of their more outlandish suggestions.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-most-useless-collectors-editions-ever-made.933039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-useless-collectors-editions-ever-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I’m a huge sucker for Collector’s Editions of games. I know they’re expensive but there’s something jubilant about opening a massive box for a game and pulling out artbooks and soundtracks and gorgeous steelbook cases that I’ll throw out immediately because I have no more shelf space left. Into the book of loose Blu-ray discs you go! Maybe I Iike Collector’s Editions so much because they remind me of old-school computer game boxes that always came in weird shapes and always included more documentation than necessary. They were goofy and grandiose. They were treasure chests.</p><p>But not every video game Collector’s Edition can be as good as, say, Cyberpunk 2077. While you could argue that a statue of V on a motorcycle is embarrassing (and you’d win that argument), the piece itself is well done and the rest of the set does a good job expanding and immersing you into the universe of the game. It really feels like you’re a tourist visiting Night City and those are your souvenirs. Including the statue, because that’s <em>exactly</em> what a tourist would buy at a cheap shop at the airport.</p><p>That said, we all know that not every Collector’s Edition is great. In fact, some video game special editions are absolutely useless. Much like myself, they have no purpose and they definitely have no reason to exist. Some of them actually make the game <em>worse</em> just by having touched this Earth. May God have mercy on their souls and may God have mercy on the poor fools who lost their shelfspace and money.</p><h2><strong>7. Halo 3: Legendary Edition</strong></h2><p>Before you get mad, let me say that this is actually a pretty <em>good</em> Collector’s Edition. In addition to the game, it had two discs with extra features about the Halo series, including a couple episodes of Red vs. Blue. The most important part, however, was the Master Chief MJOLNIR Mark VI helmet.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/halo-3-1720514663089.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Which was <em>almost</em> big enough to wear but somehow <em>just not</em>. Not that every collectible has to be wearable, but how dare you give me a Master Chief helmet that just almost fits? It could’ve been bigger! It could’ve been smaller! How dare you make every person who sees this stupid thing try to put it on and go, “Oh, it won’t fit.”</p><p>Also, not for nothing, when I left one writing job, I abandoned my Master Chief helmet on my desk. I just couldn’t take it anymore. And when I came back to that job again years later for a second run, they tried to give it back to me like a cursed object. I said no.</p><h2><strong>6. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Prestige Edition</strong></h2><p>Yeah, I’ll admit: Night vision goggles are pretty cool. But, uh, do you <em>really</em> need them? And if you did need night vision goggles, you probably wouldn’t buy them as an extra in an Activision game. You might do a little research. You might find brands that work for your night vision needs. I doubt you were like, “Babe, get the truck; we’re killing two birds with one stone by getting a hit game <em>and</em> those night vision goggles we discussed.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/cod-mw2-nightvision-1720514639744.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It’s definitely cool that the goggles work, but it’s also an item that sat in the box for years because I live in a city and I’m not casing my neighbor’s house at 2 am for a robbery. I’d say they look cool on a shelf, but they don’t. They’re night vision goggles. Even on a stand, they just look like there’s a giant military camera pointing at the room. Like the Master Chief helmet, you will get frustrated by how much space it takes up and you will eventually get rid of it during a move.</p><p>And, let’s be honest, if you’re getting a <em>ton</em> of use out of your video game special edition night vision goggles, you’re also probably on a few lists.</p><h2><strong>5. Ultima IX: Ascension Dragon Edition</strong></h2><p>That’s right, baby, we’re going back in time to the game that killed the series! The year was 1999. The Matrix was in theaters and Susan Lucci finally won her Emmy for the role of Erica Kane in All My Children after eighteen previous nominations. It was truly a big year for us all. And Ultima IX: Ascension sounded incredible, both as a game and as a collector’s edition. It included stuff like spooky books, tarot cards, and a map! It was fancy! The kids loved it.</p><p>As for the game, it was awful and broken. It played like a first draft of Skyrim that someone made in their sleep after a night of drinking. Nobody wants to make a bad game, but Ultima IX was kind of a bad game. That doesn’t make it the worst video game to ever have a collector’s edition, but it definitely feels like a milestone in that tradition.</p><p>You can include all the extras on Earth, but if the game is awful, it’s meaningless.</p><h2><strong>4. Catherine: Love Is Over Edition</strong></h2><p>The special edition for Catherine <em>absolutely</em> fits the theme of the games. Among its items are a sexy pillowcase, a cute romance shirt, and polka dot boxers that I assure you will not fit. None of these items are egregious and Catherine is a fantastic game. It’s just that… I don’t… Are you going to put that Catherine pillowcase on a pillow? When? As a bit? Are you doing it ironically? Unless you’re dating an extremely understanding person with your same freak tendencies, I don’t advise using <em>anything</em> in this collection. Despite the game being a sexy puzzle adventure, this will not contribute any meaningful help to your romantic life. It will do the opposite.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/catherine-1720514602374.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Here’s how unboxing this Collector’s Edition goes: You take out the pillow case, shirt, boxers, and fake pizza box. Then you put them in the back of your closet with the wedding album you couldn’t bring yourself to toss out after the divorce. </p><h2><strong>3. Fallout 76: Power Armor Edition</strong></h2><p>You know why we’re all here: The bag! Everything else is pretty cool: I mean, hey, the Power Armor helmet actually fits! That’s something! And the little toys and glow-in-the-dark map were pretty neat. It’s just… we were promised a canvas duffle bag. That was one of the cool selling points: A Fallout-themed duffle bag. I know that seems stupid to care about, but they changed it from being a cool military-style bag to nylon with the texture of an extremely cheap umbrella. If you went into the Wasteland, the bag would die of radiation before you would.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/fallout-76-1720514583601.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We get enough bait and switching in the games themselves. They couldn’t source it better? It’s not like they didn’t have the budget. People are paying hundreds of dollars here and one of the coolest features turned into a bag less useful than a tote you receive for donating to a radio station. Plus, Fallout 76 at launch was completely different than it is now; it was giving off real Ultima IX: Ascension vibes.</p><h2><strong>2. Mass Effect: Andromeda</strong></h2><p>Here’s the best part of Mass Effect: Andromeda’s Collector’s Edition: It doesn’t come with the game. Why would it? When I’m buying a special edition, I want all those extras to shove out the game entirely like it’s that woman’s sarcophagus in The Pearl of Love. Seriously, it’s almost impressive to call something the Mass Effect: Andromeda Collector’s Edition and not include Mass Effect: Andromeda. </p><p>Instead, it includes a remote control car. Which would be super fun if the game was released in 1992. Now, to be fair, promotional information did say that the game wouldn’t come with the Collector’s Edition. It’s just a weird choice to make. And it’s one that’s going to keep happening as companies realize that if we’re willing to spend $200 on extras for a video game, we’re probably willing to spend $70 on top of that <em>for</em> the game itself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/mass-effect-andromeda-1720514563531.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While there have been other examples of special editions without the game (including another Mass Effect release), Mass Effect: Andromeda feels like the one that turned the tide. And, not for nothing, it wasn’t really the best game until it got patched up. So, in a way, it was almost better that the special edition didn’t include the game?</p><p>Yes, it’s super annoying when there are download codes for games rather than physical discs. But no game at all? That's the chef's kiss of useless.</p><h2><strong>1. Dead Island: Riptide Zombie Bait Edition</strong></h2><p>Jesus Christ! Oh God! Who’s idea was this? Remember when I said that some special editions actually make a game <em>worse</em>? Well, here we are! Holy crap. What an awful, awful idea. I’m sorry. Not all of you can see the image. This special edition of the zombie series included the game (that’s nice!), a weapon pack (pew pew!), and a sculpture of a woman’s bloodied, decapitated torso. I don’t mean that, like, a mannequin without a head. No, it’s been sculpted to make sure you know that, yes, the head and arms have been torn off this woman.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/dead-island-riptide-bait-edition-1720514537760.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Oh, also the woman is in a bikini. That wouldn’t be a problem, but the whole “she’s been horribly mutilated to death” part takes away from the appeal. I believe this special edition was only released in Europe, I’m assuming because someone on the development team wanted to only punish Europe.</p><p>Not only is this big, weirdo thing useless, it will make people judge you. You think having the dust-covered cat-sized Halo helmet can be a little awkward? You hate having to explain your favorite video game’s night vision goggles? All child’s play. Wait until the world sees you as the type of person who owns that statue.</p><p>I mean, at least it includes the game. But if you put up that statue, if anyone sees it and escapes your basement, the feds are going to take away your computer. And then there will be no games at all.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-users-can-add-experimental-rtgi-via-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you remember the lead-up to the release of Forza Motorsport, you might also recall that developer Turn 10 Studios had <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-rtgi-future-update-forza-horizon-tech-used/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> the post-launch addition of ray-traced global illumination (RTGI). However, nine months after the October 2023 debut of the game, there's been no further mention of the feature in an official capacity.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Forza Motorsport forum user Viper3dc <a href="https://forums.forza.net/t/forza-motorsport-graphics-downgrade-research-and-comparisons/661530/574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> a way to enable RTGI on PC via a 'mod'. All you need to do is grab the XML files from the Visual Target folder (within the Forza Motorsport\Content\media\pcfamily\renderscenarios folder) and copy them into the Ultra folder, thus overwriting the Ultra settings.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Alexander Battaglia has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2yi1Hyx97w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed</a> the mod and found out that it improves visuals in various ways beyond just ray traced global illumination. For example, the Visual Target preset improves draw distance, level of detail, and object density, including grass.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this preset also expands ray traced reflections to apply to rougher materials. The expansion greatly improves visuals when using cockpit view, for instance.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest visual improvement comes from enabling RTGI, which enhances ambient shadowing across various track details and adds bounce lighting, allowing local lights to take on the color of the surfaces that are being reflected.</p>
<p>There are various caveats to modding Forza Motorsport, though. There may be visual bugs and crashes, and replays do not appear to be using the correct ray-traced reflections, which means gameplay will actually look better. Moreover, RTGI appears to occasionally introduce visible noise and even some flickering, and the rain appears to be incorrectly reflected on the roads at nighttime. Then there's the added performance cost, of course. With an RTX 3080 at 1440p, the Visual Preset mod runs 27% slower than the Ultra preset when using the default camera view. The performance cost is even higher with the cockpit camera view, going up to 40% slower performance when the mod is enabled.</p>
<p>These downsides are to be expected, given that Turn 10 still hasn't officially enabled these advanced graphics settings in the game. They can currently be considered as a preview of a potential future update.</p>

            <p>
Warframe's been fully embracing its weird side over the course of its last couple of expansions, but if you thought its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-extremes-talks-the-duviri-paradox-warframes-weirdest-expansion-yet">mood-world westerns</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-big-weird-whispers-in-the-walls-expansion-out-in-december-with-cross-save">long-lost dimension-shifting labs</a> were as far as the free-to-play shooter was willing to go, then you might want to brace yourself: developer Digital Extremes has revealed first gameplay of its upcoming 1999 story expansion and, well, let's just say you get to go into space to kill a 90s boyband.
</p>
<p>
We've known 1999 was likely to be an odd 'un ever since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">tease at last year's TennoCon</a> utterly stole the show - catapulting players away from Warframe's usual far-future sci-fi aesthetic to an eerily familiar Earth-like world of grungy subways stations and retro tech. And now, with TennoCon 2024 underway, Digital Extremes has shared more on its audacious new expansion.
</p>
<p>
To get a few burning questions out of the way first, yes it's really set in 1999 (New Year's Eve to be exact) and no, this isn't quite the Earth we know - but it's close enough, full of extremely familiar era-appropriate artefacts that feel gleefully incongruous within Warframe's wider world. And that starts with 1999's new hub area: an abandoned 90s shopping mall full of artificial palm trees, arcade machines, and screens belching out cheesy infomercials.
</p>

<figcaption>Warframe: 1999  - full 22-minute gameplay demo.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi0fgygNwvk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The mall serves as the base of the Hex, Warframe's newest Syndicate, and as Digital Extremes' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi0fgygNwvk">22-minute demo</a> begins, we're introduced to its six members, proto-forms of the game's most iconic Warframes. Players take on the role of squad leader Arthur Nightingale (batch designation: Excalibur), working alongside Amir Beckett (Volt), Aoi Morohoshi (Mag), Leticia Garcia (Trinity), Eleanor Nightingale (Nyx and, notably, Arthur's sister), plus Quincy Isaacs, whose batch designation - Cyte-09 - ties in with the new Warframe arriving alongside 1999.
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, then, the expansion's all about giving players the opportunity to experience some crucial events from Warframe's past - but, really, that's probably the least interesting thing about it. 1999 is almost hilarious in its brazenness: this is an expansion that dares to add a romance system to Warframe, enabling players to forge deeper relationships with their comrades by visiting their beige desktop PC, logging into KOL (KIM Online), and text-chatting to them IRC-style, picking dialogue options as conversations unfold. And yes, you might even get a New Year's kiss if you play your cards right.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Arthur rides through Kulvania at night. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Digital Extremes</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And if that managed to raise an incredulous eyebrow, there's more to come. One brisk cutscene later, all six members of the Hex are straddling motorcycles and careening down a neon-streaked tunnel (well, five are on bikes - Volt is running alongside them on-foot), which is unexpected enough. But then the tunnel ends and the gang bursts out into the moonlit, rain-slicked streets of Kulvania - a new open-world environment that feels somewhere between a contemporary US city and Half-Life's City 17. Players can explore its corners from the back of their motorbike once 1999 arrives, all to a screeching metal soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
At this point in the demo, Digital Extremes switches to something a little closer to Warframe's traditional third-person action. After a run-in with Scaldra commander Major Neci Rusalka, enemies begin swarming the streets and there's a look at 1999's combat, combining classic Earth-like weaponary with flashier sci-fi attacks. Eventually, the battle spills out into a large open plaza where players encounter the boss-like H-04 Efervon Tank, at which point everything erupts into absolute chaos - heavy gunfire, poison-spewing drones, laser blasts, and constant airdrops of new troops ratcheting up the intensity.

<p>
But suddenly, a pause as the figure seen at the end of last year's 1999 teaser emerges, and Arthur gives chase - the action soon shifting down into the tunnels of an abandoned subway system full of pulsating biolumicent plants and strangely organic tech. We see Arthur interact with a "security terminal", which players can hack by playing a mini-game reminiscent of mobile phone classic Snake - but failure results in a sudden enemy influx, and more troublingly, the potential to be injected with a Coda worm virus. What's this? Well that's not entirely clear just yet, but Arthur's demo journey comes to an end doubled in pain as a strange bank of screens births a giant creature (think Audrey in Little Shop of Horrors) which <em>then</em> spews out the Warframe version of Excalibur we all know and love. Cue credits.
</p>
<p>
Except... we then return to the Origin System, centuries later, where something's definitely not right. As a Railjack mission unfolds, pulsating music is suddenly heard over the comms, leading players to an asteroid in the depths of space. Disembarking, they discover the music's source: a huge Earth-like concert stadium that's manifested somewhere it <em>really</em> shouldn't have - seemingly as a result of that earlier Coda virus. We're still not done, though: Arthur enters the stadium and follows its corridors out into the open, revealing a live gig in progress. Lights flash, lasers dance, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88">convincingly 90s-style pop anthem</a> blasts out over the sound system, and some weird creature is puking five infested members of the (fictional) boyband On-Lyne out onto the stage. Boss time - but, alas, that's where the demo ends.

<p>
It's brilliantly ballsy stuff, and Warframe players will be able to see where all this is heading when 1999 launches this "winter". And beyond the story campaign, it'll also introduce Gemini skins - letting players switch between their Warfarme and its fully customisable 1999 counterpart at will - plus the new sniper-focused Warframe, Cyte-09.
</p>
<p>
There's even more going on ahead of 1999's release, however, with Digital Extremes promising two additional Warframe updates before then. August brings The Lotus Eaters, a "micro-story" serving as a prologue to 1999, and it'll be followed by a second update in autumn - to be detailed more thoroughly at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Expect a new theme, though, plus a new Warframe and various quality of life improvements, including a Caliban rework (Caliban will be free as part of update), new Incarnons, Companions 2.0 Part 2, and more.
</p>
<p>
But even before all of <em>that</em> - right now, in fact - players can get a taste of Warframe's 1999 expansion in a special in-game narrative experience that'll let them explore a version of its mall hub as part of a Special Relay. It'll be available for around a week following TennoCon 2024.

<p>The Esports World Cup continues to unfold in Riyadh, with more games than ever being represented on a grand stage. Teams from all around the world are travelling to Saudi Arabia to potentially win millions of dollars, and while plenty of titles have been awarded thus far, some of the most highly anticipated events are yet to take place.</p>



<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to catch up with Ralf Reichert, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation. I asked key questions about the future of the industry and the Esports World Cup itself. </p>



<p>Read on to see what Reichert had to say.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-ve-set-a-new-standard">‘We’ve Set a New Standard’</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that Saudi Arabia went <strong>big </strong>for the Esports World Cup. From the monumental opening ceremony to the nearly two dozen games being played at the event, nothing in the history of the esports industry has been bigger than this showcase. I asked Ralf Reichert how the team plans to top this showing during future events:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t go into detail yet on what you can expect at future events, one thing to be sure of is our commitment to deliver a one-of-a-kind celebration of competitive excellence and gaming culture for our global fans. We’ve set a new standard, and it’s our responsibility to raise it going forward.</p>



<p>All this is part of Vision 2030 and how Saudi has embraced a forward-looking attitude that creates a perfect home for the Esports World Cup. There is long-term thought here that makes me very optimistic about the future of gaming and esports in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the biggest concerns ahead of the Esports World  Cup taking place was that very setting – Saudi Arabia. Since the event kicked off, the EWC’s leadership team has reiterated that everyone is welcome, but many in the gaming community still doubt that sentiment, given the nation’s historic treatment of minorities and the LGBT community. This was an important topic to discuss with Reichert:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everyone is welcome at the Esports World Cup, and we’ve worked hard to create an inclusive environment where gaming fans from all over the world can congregate and share their passion. </p>



<p>It’s exactly the kind of celebratory atmosphere we wanted for such a massive event, and I encourage everyone who is interested in gaming and esports to make the trip, attend a tournament, enjoy one of the many concerts, check out the festival and take in the atmosphere. I believe people’s perception will change once they’ve experienced this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-everyone-welcome-riyadh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier statement</a>, Reichert was recorded as saying that nobody will be discriminated against, but he advised that people adhere to local habits and ‘cultural norms’ and suggested that they ‘don’t be explicit’ about their proclivities.</p>



<h2 id="h-gaming-isn-t-going-anywhere">‘Gaming Isn’t Going Anywhere’</h2>



<p>Speaking about the future of the esports and gaming industries, I asked Ralf Reichert for his perspective on how things are unfolding. It has been a tough eighteen months for the games industry, with thousands of layoffs striking workers worldwide and studios being closed in the blink of an eye, and the esports industry hasn’t been immune to its fair share of struggles.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m super optimistic on the future of esports and gaming. It brings people together regardless of country, age, gender or origin. And as a result of gaming’s ubiquitous popularity, esports has become one of the world’s fastest-growing and in-demand sports.</p>



<p>We’re creating the next generation of sport, one that presents esports superstars as competitive and cultural icons. Gaming isn’t going anywhere, and I expect the industry’s headwinds will propel esports forward for many decades to come.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Finally, I drew attention to the format of the Esports World Cup, focusing particularly on the format. I’ve long since wondered why the EWC would be an annual event and not one where recurrences are separated by several years, like the FIFA World Cup. Reichert was quick to explain the lay of the land:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the planning process, we debated all sorts of formats for the Esports World Cup. But while we took inspiration from top international sporting events, we felt that the EWC was best as an annual event, as the world of video games and the digital age overall work on an accelerated timeline compared to others. </p>



<p>We want to build the best platform to crown the best esports Clubs each calendar year, creating a prestigious moment for players and fans to aspire to attend. No format is set in stone, but we’re happy with the way the EWC is currently unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Esports World Cup is set to continue until the final game wraps up on August 25. Before the curtain comes down on the tournament, we’ll see the Club Championship trophy awarded, and at present, it looks as though Team Falcons will be securing the massive, multi-million-dollar prize in that arena.</p>

<p>Today, one of the most dramatic showdowns in Call of Duty League history will unfold as the New York Subliners and OpTic Texas face off in the grand final of the CDL Championship. It’s an intense match-up that pits the titans of the league against one another – and it has been a strenuous journey getting this far.</p>



<p>With $1.2 million on the line for the victor, there’s a huge amount to play for. This is one of the most exciting grand finals we’ve had lined up for years, and there’s so much riding on the line here – it would be the first ring for OpTic in COD since 2017, but a win for the Subliners would make them the first back-to-back world champions in Call of Duty history.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League Championship has been a stellar tournament thus far. Both the winner’s bracket and the elimination bracket have been on fire, and last night’s matches were nothing short of phenomenal.</p>



<p>It started with Toronto Ultra wiping Atlanta FaZe off the board with a 3 – 0 sweep, booting the favourites from the competition rather unceremoniously. Then, the LA Thieves – a team that has truly shown up in recent weeks – pushed Miami Heretics out of the running with another sweep, looking dominant and hungry as they moved one step closer towards the trophy.</p>



<p>At that point, Ultra and Thieves faced off once again. On Thursday, LA managed to push Ultra into the lower bracket – and there were expectations that a huge upset would be landed by the young team from Los Angeles – and it almost went that way. In a match that went all the way to round five, both teams gave it everything they had, but Ultra clutched up to eliminate Thieves.</p>



<p>Finally, the New York Subliners and Toronto Ultra met for the first time in the tournament. In a tragic twist of fate for Toronto Ultra, the New York Subliners proved to be too much for the team to handle <strong>again</strong>, and once more, Ultra was eviscerated and removed from the running from the boys in yellow. </p>



<p>Here’s a little history lesson:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CDL Major 5 (2023)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-2)</li>



<li><strong>COD Champs (2023)</strong>: New York defeats Toronto Ultra in a record-fast Grand Final (5-0)</li>



<li><strong>CDL Major 2 (2024)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-0)</li>



<li><strong>CDL Major 4 (2024)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-0)</li>



<li><strong>COD Champs (2024)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-2)</li>
</ul>



<p>Now that the usual has happened and the Subliners have dealt Toronto a massive blow, the stage is set for a historic grand final. Either OpTic Texas will make history and secure a ring for OpTic for the first time in seven years, or the New York Subliners will become the first-ever back-to-back world champions in Call of Duty esports history.</p>



<p>Don’t miss it.</p>
