            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Witcher has no need for Tinder when journeying across the Northern Kingdoms, when he’s caught in a love triangle between Yenn and Triss. Here, though, he is now trapped in the Tinder-like left and right swiping of Reigns: The Witcher. It’s the second crossover spin-off between Reigns’ kingdom management and a popular fantasy series, but there’s a distinctly different set up to this game than before.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, Reigns: The Witcher stars Geralt of Rivia, but where you’d play as the ruler of a kingdom in the earlier games of this series and have to appease and balance the whims and desires of various factions, now you’re playing as an adventuring hero. It’s quite a shift, though Nerial has stuck with a familiar format. Kind of.</p>



<p>Geralt of Rivia isn’t really the most personable of characters. No, he’s not as monstrous and inhuman as the legends that precede him would have the general people believe, but he still needs a strong PR campaign to be seen as more than just a necessary evil. Enter Dandelion to sprinkle a little musical sparkle across his adventures, turning Geralt into a folk hero over time.</p>
<p>At least that’s the plan. with Reigns: The Witcher wrapping up the adventures within the context of Dandelion performing to a packed house. But telling stories of Geralt’s adventures is pretty tricky. You can find yourself down some unusual rabbit holes, lose the consistent narrative threads, and bend the truth a little too far.</p>

<p>The game opens with his first effort, with talking dragons, captured lovers and Geralt being burnt to a crisp, but it’s just an opening gambit, as each successive adventure leads to Dandelion finding new sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>There’s less of a single narrative thread through each play, as you’re still met by individuals that each present you with a binary choice and an instant resolution to their problem or request. A farmer might ask you to lure in a beast to spook his overly milky goats, a noble could want a particular monster’s head to adorn their mantelpiece, some townsfolk might request your help in warding off a siren living in the woods nearby, or some other mythical beast will need defeating. It seems quite rare that a situation will have a direct narrative follow up or counterpoint, and they’re almost always swiped away and resolved without issue.</p>
<p>That’s generally true when dealing with monsters and creatures too –&nbsp;you can choose to tell the siren to leave or lop off their head –&nbsp;but some will rope you into a new combat minigame that completely shifts the pacing of the game. Instead of letting you take your time, now there’s a beat to match and move to in a block-dropping puzzler.</p>

<p>Geralt roams the bottom edge of a 5×5 grid, moving left or right each beat, and all you can do is guide his direction as enemy attacks, offensive strikes and healing potions descend from the top. It’s tricky to get the hang of and need a good bit of foresight to evade some of the trickier formations that emerge. Take too many hits and it’s game over, with Dandelion having to come up with a better story next time.</p>
<p>Most decisions will have an impact to the performance, pleasing or displeasing humans, non-humans, sorcerers and monsters. The goal, as with previous games, is to keep all four of these in balance. Fall too low and Geralt meets a gristly end. Max one of them out and he’s lured into some hedonistic equivalent. You can find yourself backed into a corner,</p>

<p>You also have some added overarching goals with the inspiration points that Dandelion can draw upon. Three cards are drawn at the start, providing buffs and modifiers to make certain groups easier to please, harder to displease, add a bit of romance, or add a murderous lilt as companions can meet an untimely demise at the hands of monsters. Meeting their requirements, whether it’s flirting with people, finding a serial killer, or something else, then adds to the experience Dandelion gets at the end of a tale and his inspiration.</p>
<p>Reigns: The Witcher is an interesting twist and reframing of the simplified kingdom management series. There’s a lot that will remain familiar, a lightness to how quickly you flit between situations with a simple swipe, and plenty of amusing deaths to find. After a fleeting introductory hour and a bunch of early deaths, I’m curious to see how deep Dandelion’s imagination goes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Around two months ago, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold off</a> developer <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> (the team behind MMO games <strong>Champions Online</strong>, <strong>Star Trek Online</strong>, and <strong>Neverwinter</strong>) and publisher <strong>Arc Games</strong>, which were acquired by members of Arc Games' management team.</p>



<p>Today, Cryptic is announcing that veteran game developer executive <strong>Jack Emmert</strong> has returned to the role of <strong>Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</strong>. Key emphasis on the word returned: Emmert began his career in the gaming industry at Cryptic in 2000, right at the studio's foundation, and was eventually promoted to CEO in 2011. He left the company in December 2015. <span>After a brief stint at&nbsp;<strong>Perfect World Entertainment</strong>, Emmert joined&nbsp;<strong>Daybreak</strong>&nbsp;as CEO, managing the superhero MMORPG&nbsp;<strong>DC Universe Online</strong>&nbsp;and later working on an unannounced MMO when the studio changed its name to </span><strong><span>Dimensional Ink Game</span>s</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-on-dimensional-inks-total-independence-and-whats-next-for-the-dcuo-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I first interviewed him during this time</a>, just before COVID went global. Back then, the game was unknown; we'd later learn it would have been a superhero MMO based on <strong>Marvel IPs</strong>, but Daybreak <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-mmorpg-canceled-as-investment-is-refocused-on-smaller-projects-based-on-current-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled it in 2022</a>. The following year, Jack Emmert <span>founded a new studio,&nbsp;<strong>Jackalyptic,</strong>&nbsp;with <strong>NetEase</strong>'s help, and </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>I interviewed him about an upcoming MMO&nbsp;</span>based on the <strong>Warhammer</strong> franchise</a>. Unfortunately, that game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-warhammer-mmo-is-also-canceled-netease-shuts-down-jackalyptic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got canceled, too</a>, amid many other projects and studio closures ordered by NetEase.</p>



<p>Now, Emmert comes back home, in a way. As part of the Cryptic news, I've been able to chat with him again about his return to the CEO position and what that means for the games currently managed by the California-based developer.</p>

<p><strong>Jack, I think the last time we spoke, you were working at Jackalyptic on a Warhammer game. I’m guessing you probably cannot talk about anything that happened there.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Not really. I loved my time at NetEase and Jackalyptic; everybody was terrific. I have zero hard feelings; NetEase treated us wonderfully. Things didn't work out—that's the game industry. I've been through this rodeo many times before and I have a lot of gratitude. But I have even more gratitude that this opportunity came out of nowhere. Right as one chapter in my life was coming to a close, a brand new one started. It is unbelievable to me that I'm back at Cryptic.</p>



<p><strong>You were there from the beginning as one of the founders. What are your first impressions of being back?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> It’s fascinating. Often as an adult, if I travel back, I find myself reverting into the kid that I was—the old behaviors and the old mannerisms. It's hard to escape. But what's interesting about returning to Cryptic is that I've changed, and so has Cryptic. We're learning about each other for the first time. Some parts are familiar, but most of it isn't. It's fascinating to see how Cryptic grew in my absence. I'm learning so much from the teams and everything that they've accomplished. I'm honored that they would have me back. I hope with all the things that I've learned over the past 10 years that I can bring something new to the table, not just what I was during the first 16 years of my career at Cryptic.</p>



<p><strong>A couple of months ago, Cryptic itself, along with Arc Games, underwent a change in management. Are you 100% in charge of your own destiny?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Yes, we are. We are 100% in charge of our own destiny. I'm thrilled. I know the guys from Arc Games from back in the Perfect World days; they are super smart. I am absolutely thrilled to be on this journey. Even better, Arc Games is fully committed to Cryptic Studios, and the support that we're getting is incredible. Our teams on all of our games are bigger today than when I left 10 years ago. That shows that Arc really believes that while these games are older, they still have a lot to offer, and they have great fans.</p>



<p><strong>Are you working remotely or are you back in the studio proper?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I'm working remotely from Austin, Texas. Most of the studio is remote. I'm a big believer in that model; it increases the quality of life a lot. There certainly are challenges with communication, but those are solvable if the team is committed. I think it's the way to go with game development.</p>



<p><strong>As the new CEO of Cryptic, will you oversee all the games closely?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Absolutely. And I don't just oversee; I’m going to be the games' biggest fan. I've been playing and grinding away in Neverwinter, getting to know the new systems and how content is organized. I'll do the same thing with Star Trek Online and Champions Online. Unless I know those games as a player, I don't really offer much to the teams. I don't know the tools anymore, and if I were just a business CEO, I would just be saying "make more money." Anybody off the street can do that. In order for me to add value, I need to be able to understand those games as a player and contribute meaningfully to decisions on development.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share briefly where the games are at and what's coming next?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Right now, I'm still coming up to speed, as I only started two weeks ago. My impression is that the teams have very solid plans for content moving forward. I'm not intending to upset those in any way because I think they are good plans. As we start moving further into the future, I'll be collaborating more on what we should do. I'm also highly committed to looking at ways for us to re-engage players who have dropped out. The success of WoW Classic and Guild Wars shows the value of these nostalgic relaunches. Our games have been around for over 15 years now, and there are a lot of people who have played all three of them.</p>



<p><strong>Does that also include Champions Online? It seems Star Trek Online and Neverwinter are updated more regularly. Is that going to change with Champions Online?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Change happens if there's a demand. If you play Champions and you love it, come back, because Arc is going to give us the support for any game that shows growth. Period. I’m bullish on Champions; we've got some stuff, but we could use you. Come on back, build a champion, and let's make that game great. The superhero MMO niche hasn't really been cornered quite yet; it’s an opportunity for us to do some great stuff together.</p>



<p><strong>Could such opportunities involve being available on more platforms, like the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I'm not going to eliminate any opportunity. We did put DC Universe Online on the Nintendo Switch, so I understand the market to a degree. We'll be looking at any opportunity to get these games in people's hands.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think about the future of the industry? Do you see new investment happening from Western developers in MMOs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> It would be difficult for anybody to go to a Western publisher and ask for money to develop an MMORPG. The track record with Western publishers and MMORPGs is not very good for a lot of reasons. However, I think there's a lot of opportunity to launch a game that isn't necessarily an MMO at the start, but grows into something. A model like Warframe is a really good one; it is vastly bigger than it ever was when it first launched. That is a direction many games could go. A multiplayer story-based RPG could add an open-world component through an update or expansion. Instead of a hundred-million-dollar investment all upfront, you're making a series of $20 million bets so that at the end of five to seven years you have that big MMO, having paid for it and grown the community along the way.</p>



<p><strong>It's interesting you mentioned Warframe. Greg Street told me the same thing: that Warframe started small and grew over time, and it could be a model for future MMOs.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I know Greg quite well. I would not be surprised to see someone bootstrap a very small product, get some initial success, and continue to invest in it. Subnautica was like that, too. I think that's where you're going to see the new MMOs. To MMO fans, I'd say be patient; if you support a product and love it, just keep supporting it. It'll get there.</p>



<p><strong>When can players expect the next big updates for Cryptic's games?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> I have a rough idea of the battle plans. I was just reviewing them and I've got some surprises up my sleeve. We will roll them out as soon as we're able to nail down dates.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share the approximate size of each team and whether there is overlap between them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> In general, I'm not a fan of sharing personnel between teams. I like teams that are dedicated to a product because they know its ins and outs. I can't share exact team sizes as that is confidential information, but they are bigger than when I left. Our licensors, Paramount and Wizards of the Coast, are terrific and they’ve extended their hands to help out with tie-ins and other collaborations.</p>



<p><strong>I recently re-downloaded Neverwinter and noticed that the PC version still doesn't have official controller support, even though the game is available on consoles. Are you going to add it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> That's a great suggestion. I never even thought about it before, but I'll write that down.</p>



<p><strong>A lot of PC players play on gamepads nowadays, and it’s good for accessibility too.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jack Emmert:</strong> Absolutely, it's a great idea.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time, Jack, and good luck.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you went back in time to January 2025 and told someone that a year from now, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> would <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">undergo a "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em><strong>"</strong> that would change the face and structure of the company</a>, they might not have been too surprised by the news. If you then added that this reset would also include the cancellation of the long-awaited <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/">while <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> remained in production</a>), that might've caught them off guard.</p>



<p>But that is indeed how things shook out, with the remake indeed cancelled, as Ubisoft ultimately decided it did "<em></em><em>not meet the new enhanced quality</em>" standards it is enforcing in this new era of the company's history. <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121">A statement shared from the official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the Prince of Persia franchise shortly after the official reset announcement claimed that "<em>While the project had <strong>real potential</strong>, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit<strong>,</strong>"</em> adding that the team did not want to release something they felt fell below players' expectations, and that this cancellation "<em>does not mean we're stepping away from the franchise</em>."</p>



<p>Now, as the dust continues to settle around Ubisoft with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">more layoffs incoming</a></strong> and unions representing Ubisoft employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">calling for chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong> to recognize that he and the rest of the company's top brass are the issue</a> and not the people who actually make the games, a leaked workshop showcasing an early pre-alpha build of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake from 2024 has fans mourning the lost project even more.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qob510/prince_of_persia_sot_remake_2024_presentation/">The workshop presentation was initially found on Reddit</a>, though it was quickly copyright-claimed by Ubisoft and has since been taken down. Though not quickly enough, it would seem, as <a href="https://x.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435">X (formerly Twitter) user princeozzyX</a>, also known under the Prince of Persia Universe handle, compiled specifically the images of art and in-game screencaps that at least one fan called "<em>breathtaking</em>," while others add that the game, even in an unfinished state, already looked "<em>beautiful" </em>and that they are now "<em>even more upset</em>" over its cancellation.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake – the full workshop presentation 2024 was leaked on YouTube yesterday!</p><p>I’ve put together some of what was shown during the conference — everything looks absolutely beautiful!😩😍 </p><p>(Pre-Alpha, Early 2024)<br>Soundtrack is from the remake! <a href="https://t.co/3BDRlFlgHJ">pic.twitter.com/3BDRlFlgHJ</a></p></div>— Prince of Persia Universe (@princeozzyX) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Impressive as these images may look to some, the reality is that we don't know the full story behind the game's cancellation. That said, we can make assumptions about project mismanagement, especially when looking at the game's public history and the fact that the same leadership group that allowed this to happen is also the one that led Ubisoft to lose <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/"><strong>95% of its value in the last eight years</strong>.</a> </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-being-teased-by-ubisoft-listings-surface-on-amazon/">After leaks pointing to its imminent reveal</a>, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-remake-announced/">officially announced the remake in September 2020</a>, with a release date set for early 2021. The reception was less than ideal, with many fans calling out its lacking visuals. But the reality of the time was that we all knew it could get better, so there wasn't too much concern as long as the gameplay was solid.</p>



<p>Months after its reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed/">its release date was pushed back slightly further into 2021 to March</a>, but before it could reach that March release date, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-was-just-delayed-indefinitely/">Ubisoft announced the game had been delayed indefinitely</a>. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delay-2022-no-e3-showing/">launch was pushed to 2022</a>, before the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">taken from the <strong>Ubisoft Mumbai</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Pune</strong> studios, who were previously leading it, to <strong>Ubisoft Montreal </strong>in May 2022</a>. Almost a year to date later, in May 2023, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/">announced that the game was officially <strong>rebooted</strong> and back in the concept phase</a>.</p>



<p>After that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-passed-an-important-milestone-ubisoft-says/">development updates were scarce and vague</a>, and despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/">Ubisoft putting more teams on the project</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-details/">the initial look at the graphical overhaul</a> looking promising, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/">with a 2026 release even said to be sometime in January 2026</a>, it was ultimately not enough for Ubisoft to consider putting the game out.</p>

            <p>Well, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shush-helldivers-2s-redacted-regiment-warbond-is-all-about-being-sneakily-stealthy-and-silently-suppressed">last one</a> might have only appealed to folks open to taking on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-gets-new-stealth-missions-today-and-its-super-slimmed-install-size-version-is-finally-ready-to-take-over">a mission that demands a bunch of crouch-walking</a>, but you can't say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s second warbond of 2026 isn't offering plenty of bang for your buck. It's got an exploding hammer. There's other stuff in this Siege Breakers warbond too, but I'll be honest, none of that can boast being a stick with a thing that goes boom taped to the end.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, let me crack open the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731131980?l=english">notes</a> for this warbond, which is set to release on February 3rd, and wax lyrical about the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer. To be fair to Arrowhead, they've arguably downplayed it in marketing terms, at least when it comes to wordly description. "This sledgehammer can do straight smashing, or it can have an explosive charge attached to its head to drive the point home," they write.</p>
<p>Ok. Annnnnnnnnnndddd there it is in the trailer being bonked down onto the bonce of an automaton by a diving Helldiver who subsequently disappears in a big exploding cloud of fire and explosions. Naturally, it seems that following a killer blow like that, you can just dust yourself off, stick a new explosive charge to your hammer's head and bash on. All in all, I'd say there's plenty of potential for slapstick antics and kills worthy of being uploaded to YouTube with a title that's just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_t9z9KWZE">Steve Urkel's catchphrase</a> in all caps.</p><p>While we're here, I suppose I'll tell you about the rest of the stuff in Siege Breakers. There's the returning LAS-16 Trident from the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>, this time with six fireable beams instead of three. Building on the hammer's explodey vibes are a belt-fed grenade launcher dubbed the GL-28 and a single-shot missile launcher called the EAT-411 Leveller. On second thought, the Leveller might be just as fun as the hammer.</p>
<p>Rounding out the major additions is a "spherical, projectile-blocking shield" you can lob out for some cover,  a studded heavy armour set dubbed the SA-8 Ram, and a medium set called the SA-7 Headfirst. Both of the latter come with a passive ability that regenerates your stamina whenever you take damage, meaning you can go all night long. Well, at least until you run out of health.</p>

            <p>
Good news everybody! Geralt of Rivia is dead. He lies beneath a pile of naked, sculpted, drunken bodies in a castle ballroom. Actually, that’s not right - he’s been eaten by a dragon. Actually, that’s not right either - he drowned himself in a flagon of syrup. Fair audience, please consider which of these tragic eventualities is most befitting of your hand-claps and progression points. None of them meet your standards? Then I, Dandelion, must sing Geralt’s death anew.
</p>
<p>
Nerial and Devolver Digital have partnered with CD Projekt RED to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-the-witcher">Reigns: The Witcher</a>. I’m sure I don’t need to explain that this is a new version of Nerial’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reigns-review-pc">cherished</a> card-swiping narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, which takes place in The Witcher’s grotty and magical medieval universe. The game casts you as temporarily embarrassed ‘master poet’ Dandelion, who is both Geralt’s best mate and very often, the biggest pain in his arse. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Dandelion and Geralt have a bet on that Dandelion can’t become an ‘immortal bard’ in one year. To win the bet, Dandelion must spin progressively fancier, longer, sillier and more thrilling tales about Geralt’s heroism, all of which seemingly end in his demise.</p>
<p>As in regular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, this is done by drawing event cards and swiping left or right to make decisions that fill or empty four gauges at the top of the screen. There’s also a combat system, which sees you tapping to make Geralt hop left or right on a grid of descending damage, spell and attack icons. Between tales, you’ll channel your audience’s initially grudging applause into level-ups that unlock new starting story concepts and modifiers. "Geralt The Bathed", for example, makes Geralt stink less, improving his standing with certain kinds of people, though I imagine there will be repercussions of the “got smelled stalking a werewolf” variety.
</p><p>
I’ve had a quick fiddle with a preview build, and this seems like it’ll scratch your itch if you enjoy either The Witcher or Reigns, though it has yet to surprise me, and is likely best played on a phone. The writing is as daft and bouncy as you’d expect from both Dandelion and the writers of Reigns. The Reigns artstyle is perhaps a bit worn-out at this stage - there have been three other spin-offs, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-game-of-thrones">Reigns: Game of Thrones</a> - but it remains crisp and suave with some nifty takes on Tarot. The music readily conjures the taverns of the Nilfgaardian Empire.
</p>
<p>
I’m interested to see whether there are nods to the other cardgames in The Witcher universe – both the porno pin-up collecting from the 2008 original game, which we Don’t Talk About Nowadays, and the more recent, beloved Gwent. Mostly, though, I just want to see how far Nerial can warp Geralt and The Witcher universe via Dandelion’s improvisations, particularly given that CD Projekt are dialling up the seriousness with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Do a custard pie-based death, next, Dandelion. You can make it some kind of sex scene, if you wish.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shooting guns in <em>Highguard</em> is fun and feels very good. But the most satisfying thing to do in the newly released free-to-play raid shooter doesn’t involve guns. Instead, it happens whenever I get a chance to smash some crystals using a minigame that rewards perfection in a smart way.</p> <p>In <em>Highguard</em>, which is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox, you have the chance to visit shops during your match to buy shields, guns, ammo, upgrades, and other gear. But nothing in this world is free. Well, I guess <em>Highguard</em> is free, but whatever, my point is that you need some cash to buy this stuff. Actually, not cash but blue crystals. Bits of blue crystals, to be more precise. You get some from killing enemies and raiding or defending bases, but a fast and efficient way to get a lot of crystal shards is to mine the large deposits that litter the map. And mining these larger veins of crystal is satisfying.</p>

 <p>On PS5, you click the right stick to begin a simple timing minigame that lets you quickly smash through a big crystal deposit with a satisfying series of sounds and a big crushing blow at the end. Every time I do this perfectly, I feel good. I love it. I sometimes take a moment to break a few more crystals, even if I don’t really need to, because smashing them perfectly is such a joy. I may at one point have been caught off-guard and quickly killed by two enemy players because I was distracted while mining crystals. Awkward.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663552"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663552">©Wlidlight / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What really helps make this process feel good, besides the wonderful “<em>dink, dink, crash</em>” noises and timing minigame, is that when you perfectly nail it, the game gives you a reward: The next crystal you mine will break instantly. Oh, buddy, you better believe that feels good.</p>

 <p>Now, I would like to point out that I actually have to go mine for crystals during the middle of a long match so I can buy some shields, which isn’t my favorite part of <em>Highguard</em>. In fact, a lot of the economy around mining crystals and spending them likely needs to be tweaked to make it less annoying early on and less of a pain in the later part of a long round. But that doesn’t change the fact that the actual act of mining in <em>Highguard</em> makes me feel good. I love it. They should add a mode all about harvesting crystal shards and taking them back to your base, and whichever team has the most after five minutes wins. I’d play the heck out of that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The voice actor who portrayed Lara Croft in the first game has been cast in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. </p>



<p>The Tomb Raider live-action series recently revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple castings</a>, including Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Martin Bobb-Semple, Bill Patterson, and more. However, it seems that one of the names wasn’t included in this list, and it might be a very big one and a nostalgic voice that the die-hard fans might remember. </p>







<h2 id="h-keeley-hawes-joins-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Keeley Hawes Joins Live-Action Tomb Raider Series </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/38027622/keeley-hawes-amazon-prime-lara-croft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>, Keeley Hawes, who voiced Lara Croft in the original game, will star in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. However, she wouldn’t be playing the titular role of Lara Croft, as that has been reserved for Game of Thrones star <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-first-look-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. There’s also an image from the set that surfaced in the report, showing Hawes in a long raincoat and a shopping bag in her hand. </p>



<p>Readers have already started speculating what role she could be playing, with many guessing it could be Lara Croft’s mother, Lady Amelia Croft, the Countess of Abingdon. However, that hasn’t been confirmed yet. </p>



<p>Hawes has spoken about still meeting fans of the game, stating they are “some of the nicest people I have ever met.” These meet-ups usually go down with her “making them a new answering machine message”. She still sees that as a good thing, stating that fans are so passionate about Lara Croft, with the character being around for over 20 years, and was “a huge part of the teenage years of so many people.” </p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Bird City—New Headwinds Map Condition, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Map Conditions are a key part of what keeps ARC Raiders feeling fresh and exciting, as they can fundamentally change how a map is played. Not all of them are that drastic, though, and Headwinds’ Bird City is a simple but notable Minor Map Condition. </p>



<p>Headwinds is the first major update for ARC Raiders in 2026, and it brought with it a nice selection of content. The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a> is perhaps the star of the update, but don’t sleep on Bird City.</p>







<p>If you’re wondering what’s different with Bird City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> and where you can play it, then you’re in the right place. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-is-bird-city-on-in-arc-raiders">What Maps Is Bird City On In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Look out for the Bird Icon. Image by Insider Gaming. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bird City, the new Minor Map Condition in ARC Raiders, is exclusive to the Buried City map. </strong></p>



<p>Every hour, map conditions refresh in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-prime-specimen-arc-raiders-arc-deforester-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, with Major and Minor Conditions shifting between the line-up. If you’re looking to jump into Bird City, though, you’ll need to keep your eye on Buried City, as it won’t feature anywhere else.</p>



<p>The lore behind it is that when the Cold Snap defrosted, birds were able to return from their migration. Now they’ve returned in their masses, and they’re making nests all across Buried City—with loot ripe for the taking. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-does-bird-city-make-in-arc-raiders">What Changes Does Bird City Make In ARC Raiders?</h2>

</figure>



<p><strong>The main thing to look out for during the Bird City Minor Map Condition is the nests that are laid in chimneys across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s only a Minor Map Condition, it makes sense that nothing drastic has changed, but it does pose a nice chance to earn some extra loot. The birds have laid nests across Buried City, and you can search them all for Trinkets and Epic Loot. It’s by no means guaranteed; in fact, it’s fairly rare, but these nests are more than easy to find, so get searching!</p>







<p>Here’s the full list of changes made to Buried City during the Bird City Minor Map Condition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased amount of Trinkets</li>



<li>Increased amount of Birds</li>



<li>Increased amount of Ziplines</li>
</ul>

            <p>Last week, Ubisoft canned the long-in-development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake amid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">raft of cancellations and delays</a> which have come to serve as the starting bell for a bunch of organisational changes that are currently crystalising into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">job cuts</a>. Now, actor Eman Ayaz has released a video in which she discusses having learned last week that three years worth of her work on an unnamed project had been tipped down the drain. </p>

<p>The video doesn't see Ayaz specify that the project she's talking about is the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, with the actor claiming early on that she's "still under NDA". According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-cancelation-actress-says-shes-lost-3-years-of-work-and-found-out-via-the-internet">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/it-was-devastating-prince-of-persia-remake-actor-found-out-the-game-was-cancelled-via-the-internet/">VGC</a>, Ayaz has seperately reposted some comments from fans which suggest the Sands of Time remake is the project she's referring to here.</p>
<p>"I've dedicated the last three years of my life to this project and spent those years getting to know the team, which has become like a family to me," Ayaz said. I've watched it grow through countless stages of development and I've waited and waited for the day that it was finally going to be released and I could finally talk about it. And this week I found out through the internet that the project has been cancelled."</p><p>According to the actor, she found out about the cancellation after her brother spotted an article about it. "I was just in total shock," she recalled. "Just last month or two months ago, I had filmed marketing for this project. Everything had been running smoothly and that was the last that I had heard and we were all really looking forward to it being released this year."</p>
<p>Ayaz claimed she turned down "other opportunities" while working on the project and opted to keep coming to work on it with a broken foot. Following the cancellation, the Canadian Pakistani actor has had to abandon plans to apply for a visa to work in the US and aim to land gigs there off the back of having the now-cancelled project on her resume.</p>
<p>In their statement about the Sands of Time remake's cancellation, Ubisoft wrote that "while the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit". The company also added that they "didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents".</p>
<p>"Sadly, the entertainment industry is not really just about entertainment," Ayaz said towards the end of her video. "It's about guaranteeing a cash flow. And that means making decisions that treat people's lives as collateral damage and art as disposable content. I'm not the only person that this decision affects, and it's a really sad thing to see the aversion to risk in the entertainment industry."</p>

              <p><span>Mega Starmie, the long-legged starfish alien(?) mega-evolved Pokémon that debuted in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> has been a surprising breakout star since October. Many fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>couldn’t stand the thing’s goofy design</span></a><span>, but it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>actually kind of a beast in the game</span></a><span>, so folks are coming around on the meme machine. However, after making its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>horrific anime debut</span></a><span>, Mega Starmie has now made its way to another side of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community where it has started wreaking havoc: competitive TCG play.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663535">© The Pokémon Company / Bulbapedia</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Starmie_ex_(Nihil_Zero_21)"><span>Mega Starmie ex card</span></a><span> launched as part of the Japanese Nihil Zero booster set last week, and in just a few short days, it’s becoming a staple in competitive tournaments overseas. As </span><a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/mega-starmie-ex-decks-winning"><i><span>Wargamer</span></i></a> <span>lays out, the card is consistently helping players place in Japanese tournaments thanks in no small part to its Jet Blow attack, which does a whopping 120 damage to the opponent’s active Pokémon as well as 50 damage to one on their bench. As such, Mega Starmie ex puts constant pressure on your opponents in a way that sounds kind of broken. </span></p>

 <p><span>Some are even using it alongside the </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Risky_Ruins_(Mega_Evolution_127)"><span>Risky Ruins stadium card</span></a><span> which damages monsters on the bench for an additional 20 HP, so you can feasibly wipe out some benched cards pretty quickly with the right combo. Mega Starmie itself is pretty bulky, too, with 330 HP, so knock it off the field can take some time, and by then, you might already have taken too much damage.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Starmie’s off-putting design and weirdly human mannerisms give it the air of an absolute gremlin troublemaker, so I guess it makes sense that every time it shows up in a different </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game it’s a menace. The Mega Starmie ex card has three variants, including a secret illustration that makes it look like some kind of kaiju monster stomping over a city. It’s fun to see The Pokémon Company leaning into this thing’s chaos energy.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguards-small-team-sizes-are-a-problem-2000663511</link>
            <guid>1417645</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard</em></a> is out now after a really weird period of time in which it seemed like everyone had an opinion on a game that we’d only seen two minutes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">via a Game Awards finale trailer</a>. Anyway, it’s finally here, and I’ve played about six hours of the new free-to-play FPS so far. While I’m not an expert, I have put enough time in solo and with friends to come to one conclusion: 3 players versus 3 players is a problem.</p> <p>How a match in <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em></a> works is that two teams of three spend a bit of time setting up defenses at a base, then everyone rushes out into a big map to find loot, and eventually they all race to a large sword that forms somewhere and which can be used by one team to break into the other’s big base. Then a raid happens, with the attacking team trying to blow up key locations like in a match of <em>Counter-Strike</em> with limited respawns, while the defenders try to take them out and stop the assault. Eventually, one team will win, and the other will lose. These matches can be tense and come down to one awesome play by one player. And this is a problem in a 3v3 format.</p>

  <p>I think a key aspect of online competitive multiplayer games that doesn’t get talked about much is that you need enough players to let people “blame” someone else.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em>,</a> for example, is really good at providing you and your friends plenty of other people you can blame for losses or slow victories. And even <em>Call of Duty</em>, which has smaller lobbies, still has more than 3v3 in most modes, which lets less skilled players feel less pressure to perform perfectly. “It’s okay, there are a few other people. I’m not ruining the match!” And as someone who is good at some shooters and bad at others, being able to blame others or not feel like I’m the sole reason we lost is very helpful.</p>

 <p><em>Highguard’</em>s 3v3 format and focus on tactical teamwork means there’s nowhere for people who are learning or less-skilled players to hide. I had a match in which a teammate I’d been randomly matched with seemed to be still getting the hang of the game, which makes sense as it just launched, but they failed in some team fights and screwed up a key 1v1 battle, and it led to us losing. The other rando I was with wasn’t kind on the mic. Will that less-skilled player want to come back?</p>

 <p>3v3 also just feels like too few people for <em>Highguard’s</em> massive maps. The moment one person splits off, they are likely to run into two or three enemy players if they push too far, and that’s a fight they’ll likely lose. With 4v4 or 5v5, people could split up but still have at least a partner to help. It could make base defense more exciting as you could more evenly split yourselves between the bombs and make rotating less necessary, which would help when playing with no-mic randos.</p> <p>I’m not suggesting that developer Wildlight can just go in, flip a switch and instantly turn <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220"><em>Highguard</em></a> into a 4v4 or 5v5 game. But, if the team is looking for a way to bring in more players and make it easier for casual shooter fans to enjoy what it offers, I think upping the playercount in a “casual” mode that also contains a few other tweaks could go a long way toward helping <em>Highguard</em> stick around and even grow.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> has never been short on explosive tools of destruction, but the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/27/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-premium-warbond-drops-february-3/">Siege Breakers update</a>, new warbond included, aims to take things to the next level. Moreover, a terrifying old threat from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-review">first Helldivers</a> could be back soon.</p>
<p>Via the official PlayStation Blog (as shared above) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731131980?l=english">Steam</a>, PlayStation and Arrowhead Studios have announced the full scope of this next content update set to arrive on 3rd February. As always, it's partially defined by a new premium warbond packed with new weapons and cosmetics. This pass can be obtained with Super Credits which you either buy or slowly amass by completing certain objectives in the game.</p>
<p>The SA-7 Headfirst and SA-8 RAM armour sets are prominently featured in the trailer, which you can watch below, but it's the new primary weapon and the three new stratagems which steal the show.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9E9-iGwK_4">
</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9E9-iGwK_4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>The "shotgun-like" LAS-16 Trident makes a return with six beams now blasting the enemies of Super Earth apart. On the stratagem front, the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer will no doubt become a new favourite, as it can just smash the old-fashioned way or go big and loud with an explosive charge that makes me fear for my fellow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>' lives.</p><p>Heavy weapons also get a boost through the GL-28 Grenade Launcher and EAT-411 Leveller stratagems. The former is self-explanatory and can fire a "non-stop" barrage of nades, but the latter is a next-level rocket launcher with a high-yield missile. Defence isn't being left behind either, as the throwable G/SH-39 Shield generates a shield that deflects heavy projectiles while you do your thing or catch your breath.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"Emotes, patterns, and more" are part of the new warbond as well, but it's the trailer's final seconds that unnerve us, as a new massive threat might be on the horizon: Helldivers 1's cyborgs. Whether they'll be treated as a totally separate faction or as part of the Automaton horde remains to be seen, but most veterans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/">Helldivers subreddit</a> seem to agree on what's coming next for Super Earth's forces.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-reduced-installation-size">heavily reducing the game's install size</a> following substantial player complaints, it appears that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-just-learned-there-is-a-helldivers-2-rogue-lite-mode-prototype-at-arrowhead-and-now-i-really-want-to-try-it-out">development of new content</a> is once again full steam ahead. Moreover, the live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Helldivers movie</a> is gaining momentum fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released an overview trailer for the addition of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/virtual-boy-is-joining-the-switch-online-library-but-youll-need-a-stereoscopic-accessory/">Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics</a> on Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, launching on 17th February 2026 alongside the Virtual Boy accessory (both the cardboard model and plastic recreation).</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics – Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVvaCe4esCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Available as part of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> membership, Nintendo is rolling in a bunch of the niceties that are common to all the other emulated games in the service. You’re able to rewind the game state if you make a mistake, and you can pause the game to check and modify controller mappings.</p>
<p>Another major feature will be the ability to recolour the games from the red-on-black look that defined this strange era of Nintendo gaming, to having yellow, green, white or potentially more. If using the plastic headset, you’ll have to remove a red colour filter in order for this feature to work.</p>
<p>The seven launch titles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>3-D Tetris</li>
<li>Galactic Pinball</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>The Mansion of Innsmouth</li>
<li>Red Alarm</li>
<li>Teleroboxer</li>
<li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming later in 2026 are more games from the catalogue, including two previously unreleased titles.</p>
<ul>
<li>D-Hopper (previously unreleased)</li>
<li>Jack Bros.</li>
<li>Mario Clash</li>
<li>Mario’s Tennis</li>
<li>Space Invaders Virtual Collection</li>
<li>Virtual Bowling</li>
<li>Vertical Force</li>
<li>V-Tetris</li>
<li>Zero Racers (previously unreleased)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Virtual Boy was an ignominious flop in the mid 90s, selling only 770,000 united before being discontinued, though has later come to be appreciated for its bold step toward what has eventually become VR gaming. Part of its failure has to be put down to the technology of the time, so while it offered stereoscopic 3D, it exclusively used red LED lights to render the graphics and give a sense of depth. Additionally, instead of being strapped to your head like a modern VR headset, the Virtual Boy sat on a tabletop mount, providing a fixed view to players of its games and giving an awkwardness to how you engage with the system, no doubt contributing to the headaches, dizziness and eye strain that the system became known for inducing.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s desire to constantly experiment and innovate has seen them return to 3D on various occasions, though. The most famous, of course, was the Nintendo 3DS, which featured an autostereoscopic top screen that could create 3D without the need for glasses. While impressive, the impact of this diminished over time until Nintendo released 2D-only versions of the 3DS. A fun little aside for the Nintendo Labo project on original Switch had a cardboard VR adapter, similar in concept to early VR adapters for phones, where you slot the screened device into a box with lenses to get the same effect. It’s this notion that is being revived for emulating the Virtual Boy in 2026.</p>
<p>It will be really interesting to see if and how this new version of Virtual Boy works.</p>

            <guid>1417612</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="b0044f63e3801"><a title="The Last Story 15th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0044f63e3801/the-last-story-15th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / XSEED</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back at the tail-end of the Wii's run as the hottest console ticket in town, so around about 2011 to be precise, there were a few special RPGs that released in rather quick succession to give Nintendo's magic box a surprisingly exciting last hurrah.</p>
<p>Indeed, casting my mind back now — and unaided by AI, I'll have you know — I seem to remember something called '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/07/talking_point_the_growing_storm_of_operation_rainfall">Operation Rainfall</a>', which was a fan-side campaign to have three outstanding RPGs brought over to the West; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/xenoblade_chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/pandoras_tower">Pandora's Tower</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/last_story">The Last Story</a>.</p>
<p>We can argue all day about how much effect this campaign actually had in the end (as far as I recall, Xenoblade was already on the way), but it was exciting times for sure, and rallying behind the release of this trio of titles had us all chomping at the bit to get stuck into 'em.</p>
<p>But were they — and more specifically, was The Last Story — actually any good? Well, I think we all know the answer to that is a resounding 'yes', so let's not bother with the pantomime build-up and just get on with saying Happy 15th Birthday to you, The Last Story, you absolute belter!</p>
<p>Directed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/irm-going-to-be-a-grandfather-very-soon-is-neo-dimension-hironobu-sakaguchirs-final-fantasian">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, who you may know as the father of the little known '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>' franchise of 'video games' (never heard of them), The Last Story is somewhat poignant, before we even begin on the game itself, in being Sakaguchi's return to directing duties following a personally painful period that culminated in his departure from Square.</p>

<p>Having got himself deeply involved in the creation of <strong>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</strong>, which tanked at the box office and cost Square dearly, the RPG maestro distanced himself from the industry for years before returning with a new studio. Mistwalker went on to bring us the excellent <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/lost_odyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></strong> and <strong>Blue Dragon</strong> (which wasn't quite so great) before releasing The Last Story itself, Sakaguchi's final full-on console game before spinning off into mobile-first fare.</p>
<p>Back when The Last Story released, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wii/last_story">former NL editor Tom Whitehead gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it took a fresh approach for the time, and for the most part, this freshness comes down to real-time combat that's semi-automated in its approach. Please, don't recoil in horror, though, as there's so much going on here that, in practice, those automated attacks are a blessing.</p>
<p>Assuming the role of Zael, a mercenary and gang leader on the island of Lazilus, you act as a sort of field marshal or point guard-type figure during party combat, one who directs the flow of battle by assigning tasks, attacks, manoeuvres and so on to party members via your crossbow target. You still have direct control over Zael, and you can even assign attacks to a button if you want, but there's so much going on, especially in bigger battles, that automated feels right, once you get used to it.</p>
<p>The game has a nice take on a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/gears_of_war">Gears</a>-style cover system built in, and when it's all working well, it feels as much like a full-on action game as it does an RPG (hence all the frame rate stutters at times). Missions do well in giving you exploration opportunities before funnelling you towards big, inescapable boss scraps and cinematic moments. It's the sort of thing you can blow through in about 20 hours, or spend 50 hoovering everything up.</p>

<p>Whilst there's no doubt it definitely takes some getting used to, and the real struggle is in the first few hours before fights really open up, stick with this one and its winning formula shines through, giving you something different to grapple with on the combat front <em>and</em> something different nestled at the heart of a strong story.</p>
<p>I won't ruin that part here, because I genuinely want you to go play it, but if you loved the unique vibe of the likes of The Lost Odyssey, you'll get that same sort of feeling from this one. It's magical and beguiling in a strange, eerie, and delicate sort of way.</p>
<p>The Last Story nails its look and its atmosphere hard, and while it may not be the most impressive thing to behold overall (and especially in today's economy), it's also a weirdly timelessly stylised thing that still manages to bewitch. It helps, too, in this regard, that the soundtrack by none other than Nobuo Uematsu is a corker.</p>

<p>Even now, 15 years down the line from its Japanese launch (the English-localised version came out the following year), booting into the game for the first time in at least a decade, I find that it still holds up in terms of this uncanny atmosphere and in its capacity to captivate. Indeed, although the performance issues and stutters that held it back from a better score from Tom at launch are very notable these days, this is still something I'll happily sit down and get totally lost in all over again.</p>
<p>Now, enough cake and celebrating. Where's my Switch 2 remake with 120fps combat and motion controls?</p>

The company also revealed some new features for the games, including the option to change the color of Virtual Boy titles which were notoriously limited to only bright red on the original hardware.</p><p>Both the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fvirtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829%2F" rel="sponsored">$99.99 Virtual Boy headset accessory</a> and the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fvirtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828%2F" rel="sponsored">$24.99 cardboard version</a> require a Switch or Switch 2 console to be inserted in order to play Virtual Boy games.

              <p>Valve’s attempt to have courts dismiss a legal action brought against it for allegations of overcharging and anti-competitive practices has failed, as reported by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">the <em>BBC</em></a>. A <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/judgments/16407724-vicki-shotbolt-class-representative-limited-v-valve-corporation-judgment-cpo">judge’s ruling</a> is allowing the case brought by lawyer Vicki Shotbolt to go ahead on behalf of 14 million Steam users in the UK.</p> <p>First filed in 2024, Shotbolt’s claim (with <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/about-us/">its own fancy website</a>) is an attempt to prove that Valve’s policies on Steam violate UK laws on “anti-competitive prices” and “unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them.” The argument concerns Valve’s demand that games sold on Steam not be made available at a permanently lower price on rival stores, <em>and</em> that once you buy a game on Steam, the only way you can buy further content for that game—be it DLC, expansion packs or cosmetics—is also via Steam. This, Shotbolt claims, allows Valve to “hold a dominant position in the PC gaming market” and “that it may have used this position in ways that violate UK competition law.”</p>

 <p>Class action lawsuits are not a commonplace event in the UK, where the mass litigation is known as a “collective action claim,” and works on an “opt-out” basis. Basically, Shotbolt and her law firm are going to sue Valve on behalf of British Steam users unless they specifically say they don’t want in. That’s how it’s able to claim to be suing on behalf of 14 million people.</p> <p>Valve, obviously, objects to the claims, and filed to have the case thrown out. A ruling filed January 26 by the Competition Appeal Tribunal says that Valve opposed on the basis that the “PCR” (the shorthand for Shotbolt’s group) “had not put forward an adequate methodology” before venturing all manner of peculiarly specific fiddly details about “determining the effect of the alleged PPOs [Platform Parity Obligations]” and that the “class definition was inadequate” and so on. The latter was seemingly based on lots of kids using Steam, and how they couldn’t opt in or out of the action. It all seemed to amount to “They didn’t cross their Ts sufficiently,” and the tribunal was having none of that.</p>

 <p>Shotbolt’s team promised to double-check their punctuation, and that seemed to be enough to have Valve’s concerns overturned. “The PCR proposed revisions to the <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/#classDefinition">proposed class definition</a> which substantially diminished the concerns raised by Valve,” says the ruling, which appears to mean they rejigged things to ensure it was just representing over 13s…I think? “In light of that development,” says the ruling, “the Tribunal rejected Valve’s challenge in this respect.”</p>

 <p>All of that basically amounts to “Yup, this action can go ahead,” which will mightily annoy Valve. Those who don’t want to be included in the entire PC gaming population of Britain will have the option to opt out pretty soon, given <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/">the site’s FAQ</a> stated it was waiting for this very certification before offering the option. Given 99.9 percent of Steam users will never even know this action is taking place, that sounds impressively farcical.</p> <p>Should the PCR win, it’ll mean everyone in the UK is entitled to some money back, which will likely be fairly meaningless amounts to all involved except for Valve. The claim is looking for £656 million, which at the time of writing is $904 million. Given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-pc-sued-price-fixing-1851537419">when we first covered this story in 2024</a> that figure converted to $838 million, Valve will likely hope for a quick resolution before Trump manages to tank the dollar even further.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve</a> is going to have to defend itself in court for its pricing and commission practices. A class action lawsuit in the United Kingdom (UK) brought against the company is looking for roughly $900 million (£656 million) in damages.</p>



<p>First filed back in 2024 by Vicki Shotbolt, the lawsuit claims that Valve charges “excessive commission charges” that lead to <strong>“an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers”.</strong></p>







<p>The <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lawsuit also alleges</a> that Valve forces platform party obligations <strong>“that prohibit publishers from selling products through other distribution channels on better terms than the same Products are available on Steam.”</strong> They say that this practice is likely to restrict competition. </p>



<h2 id="h-valve-argues-that-there-s-not-enough-evidence">Valve Argues That There’s Not Enough Evidence</h2>







<p>Valve’s defense claims that the group suing the company can’t establish proper claims regarding its commission pricing due to the fact that the suit doesn’t “consider the effect of Steam Keys”.</p>



<p><strong>“Without a credible plan for taking Steam Keys into account, the PCR cannot establish Steam’s actual effective commission charge, and without this, the PCR cannot establish whether the commission charge amounts to an unfair price,”</strong> Valve argues.</p>



<p>They also say that suing group <strong>“failed to show a plan to determine which Steam Partners actually paid these allegedly unfair prices.”</strong></p>







<p>Despite these arguments and others, the London Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the case must move forward. As of publishing, Valve has not responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>The case was filed on behalf of up to 14 million users, including minors. Shotbolt’s attorneys say that the average loss ranges between $30-$60 (£22-£44) per person.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>High-level players seeking a greater challenge and impossible odds in ARC Raiders have a sadistic new mode to tackle—Solos vs Squads. It’s exactly as it sounds, and if you want to play the new game mode and see what it’s all about, read on for full guide details.</p>



<p>If you thought there was enough danger in ARC Raiders, think again. The January <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds Update</a> went overboard with a new Solos Vs Squads game mode. The nature of it has the community confused, though, so this should clear up any questions you have, fellow Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">How To Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A simple toggle. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After you’ve updated ARC Raiders to include the Headwinds Update, you should see a setting in the matchmaking box in the bottom corner saying ‘Solos vs. Squads,’ and this is the key to the difficult matchmaking you seek.</strong></p>



<p>Here are some quick steps to help you out:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up your copy of ARC Raiders.</li>



<li>Make sure the Headwinds Update is installed and ready to go.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Select the matchmaking box in the bottom-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Highlight <strong>Solo vs. Squads</strong>.</li>



<li>Have it set to <strong>ON</strong>.</li>



<li>ARC Raiders will find a Solo Vs Squads match for you.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-need-to-be-to-play-solo-vs-squads-in-arc-raiders">What Level Do You Need To Be To Play Solo Vs Squads In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>You have to be at least Level 40 to queue up for Solo Vs Squads matchmaking in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re Level 39, you’ll need to grind it out first. This isn’t a mode for newcomers or even relatively experienced players. Solo Vs Squads is a tough test with hardened players and veterans in mind. If you queue up, there’s a high likelihood you’ll be beaten and bested by macho squads keen to bully you. It’s a dangerous battlefield where humans are more dangerous than anarchic ARCs!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">What Is Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This might be a fairer fight. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking means you’ll set foot on the grounds above Sperenza, and you will run into full squads as a solo player in ARC.</strong></p>



<p>There really is no other way to put this: Solo Vs Sqauds is not for the faint of heart. Real people will potentially pose a far greater problem than AI. You need to be extra cautious, and if you get into a firefight, you need to be prepared, because it will be a tough skirmish.</p>



<p>There are reasons to put yourself through this, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-should-you-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">Why Should You Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The Solo Vs Squads playlist allows you to earn more XP for kills and extracts while traversing ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>You don’t get extra-special rewards for this game mode; literally, the only incentive is more XP, and that’s it. This might put many of you off immediately, and it’s likely not supposed to be the new mode everyone gravitates toward.</p>



<p>But as Embark has said in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds patch notes</a>: “Solo vs Squads is a new matchmaking option for our experienced and highly skilled players who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game. Solo Raiders level 40 and above will get the “Solo vs Squad” toggle above matchmaking to join the Squads queue and tackle squads of Raiders head-on. When opting in, players will receive +20% bonus XP at the end of the round on both successful extract, and defeat.”</p>



<p>Are you a high enough level to play? Is the extra XP worth the risk with no real rewards on offer? Let the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> know if you intend to ride solo, or if you have other ARC Raiders conversations you want to have!</p>
