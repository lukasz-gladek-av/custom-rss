            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-removes-nomination-for-the-first-time-ever.1357510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time ever, a nomination has been revoked from The Game Awards. The game in question, Megabonk, was disqualified with permission from the creator after a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Since 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>&nbsp;have become a big celebration for the best of gaming each year. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, it’s become home to several big reveals and moments, especially for Game of the Year. With a year as big as 2025 was for games, the competition is sure to be worthy of watching. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nominations for the awards</a> came out earlier this week and had some snubs and surprises. However, it seems there’s already been a shakeup with one of the nominated games.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to vedinad</figcaption></figure>



<p>The situation unraveled after The Game Awards nominations earlier this week. Megabonk, one of the games’ up for Best Debut Indie Game, was a pretty popular title when it released. However, the creator, who, <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the Tweets</a>, goes by John Megabonk, asked to be removed from the nominations. As for why, he said the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m withdrawing from The Game Awards. It’s an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don’t think it qualifies for the category ‘Debut Indie Game,’</strong>” the creator said. “<strong>I’ve made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game.</strong>“<a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603"></a></p>



<p>The category, Best Debut Indie Game, is reserved for those who’ve published their first-ever game as a studio, so those who have, even under a different name, shouldn’t count. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later posted on Twitter</a> that, after the creator’s comments, that <strong>Megabonk would be taken off the list</strong>. This now leaves&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Despolete, and Dispatch as the sole nominees. While it is shocking to see, at least the creator was honest about the situation. Unfortunately, Megabonk was only nominated for the one category so, while they won’t be going home with anything this year, at least it was on a good note.</p>







<p>What do you think of Megabonk being disqualified from The Game Awards? Do you agree with the withdrawal? Did you think it could’ve won the category? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

Next year, instead of a new game, the company will opt to release a paid expansion for <em>F1 25</em> as part of “a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">EA says</a>. The next full <em>F1</em> game, a “reimagined” experience, will arrive in 2027.</p><p>The 2026 DLC for <em>F1 25</em> is a “premium content update” that will “align with the sport’s major changes for the 2026 season, bringing fans new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers,” <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/EA-SPORTS-Announces-Plans-for-Future-EA-SPORTS-F1-Experiences-Including-2026-FIA-Formula-One-World-Championship-Season-Expansion--All-New-F1-Game-in-2027/default.aspx">according to EA’s press release</a>. (F1 cars are in for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24173356/f1-2026-tech-changes-explained">some major changes next year</a> that the DLC will presumably need to account for.) Timing and pricing for the expansion will be announced sometime in 2026.</p><p>EA is vague on specific details about its plans for the 2027 game, but says it will be “a deeply authentic and innovative representation of the action and thrill of Formula 1, reimagined into a more expansive experience with new ways to play for fans around the world.” It’s described as “part of a multi-year strategic investment in the EA Sports F1 franchise, with support from both Formula One Management and the F1 teams.”</p><p>Apple is betting big on F1, too, signing a major multi-year deal to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801597/apple-tv-f1-exclusive-sports-racing-streaming">stream F1 races on Apple TV</a> in the US starting next year.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/823675/ea-f1-25-2026-2027-dlc-expansion-update-game]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Merry Christmas! But sorry, I think you must have been bad because all I have to offer you is this new Walmart commercial starring <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-news-goggins-wrapped-done-filming-2026-1851779855">Walton Goggins, aka the Ghoul from Amazon’s<em> Fallout</em> series</a>, in a crass attempt to cash in on millennial nostalgia for that Jim Carrey Grinch movie.</p> <p>Yup, Walton Goggins took what I assume was a sizeable paycheck to star in a new, very expensive-looking Walmart ad that is clearly inspired by Dr. Seuss’ holiday classic <em>How The Grinch Stole</em> Christmas, and more specifically by the 2000 film adaptation starring Jim Carrey. (Nobody tell Amazon that Goggins is in a Walmart ad!) Goggins not only looks like Carrey’s Grinch, but even (mostly) does a solid impersonation of the comedian’s famous portrayal of the Christmas-hating monster. Here’s the ad:</p>

  <p>It’s better than the animated movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch,that you likely forgot even got made, but come on, Goggins. How much money do you need? Really,&nbsp;I can spot you a fifty if that helps you avoid shit like this.</p> <p>As I’ve said before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-59-best-ads-celebs-ford-keoghan-selling-out-1851759498">we really need to once again start bullying celebrities and actors who do TV commercials</a>. Selling out isn’t cool, kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dS5N8EAOtVE">Back in my day, you’d go to Japan and do ads there</a> to hide the fact you were a sellout. And in fact, you get put on the naughty list for doing it.&nbsp; True story, I asked Santa Claus and he confirmed it to me. He also said being a games journalist gets you on the naughty list, too, and then complained that my<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"> <em>Black Ops 7</em> review</a> was too harsh and slammed the door in my face. Anyway, this commercial is gross! Bah, humbug, I say!</p>

The roads of Ashes of the Damned are dangerous, so you'll want the map's new Wonder Vehicle in order to survive. Here we'll guide you through how to repair and upgrade Ol' Tessie to make the truck even more powerful. We'll also include some helpful tips for finding and respawning the truck.</p><p dir="ltr">The full upgrade quest requires the use of the map's unique Necrofluid Wonder Weapon, and you'll want to get started on these steps as soon as possible. You can refer to our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-7-zombies-wonder-weapon-how-to-get-the-necrofluid-gauntlet-in-ashes-of-the-damned/2900-7261/#6">how to unlock the Necrofluid Wonder Weapon</a>. There are also parts for later steps that you can collect early in your match, so it's best to read through the parts needed for Tessie's turret upgrade before getting started.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing all upgrades for Ol' Tessie will also unlock the Black Ops 7 trophy/achievement titled "I Heard You Like Upgrades."</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Ashes_of_the_Damned_s_Wonder_Vehicle_explained">Ashes of the Damned's Wonder Vehicle explained</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_fully_upgrade_Ol__Tessie">How to fully upgrade Ol' Tessie</a><ul><li><a href="#T_E_D_D__upgrade">T.E.D.D. upgrade</a></li><li><a href="#Pack_a_Punch_upgrade">Pack-a-Punch upgrade</a></li><li><a href="#Abomination_upgrade">Abomination upgrade</a></li><li><a href="#Turret_upgrade">Turret upgrade</a><ul><li><a href="#Ravager_Eyes">Ravager Eyes</a></li><li><a href="#Human_Bones">Human Bones</a></li><li><a href="#Widow_s_Lantern">Widow's Lantern</a></li><li><a href="#Hoard_Husk_Chunks">Hoard Husk Chunks</a></li><li><a href="#Powder_of_the_Forgotten">Powder of the Forgotten</a></li><li><a href="#Mysterious_Limb">Mysterious Limb</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Create_serum_in_Yuri_s_Lab">Create serum in Yuri's Lab</a></li><li><a href="#Collect_three_keys">Collect three keys</a><ul><li><a href="#Nightbird_key__Red_key_">Nightbird key (Red key)</a></li><li><a href="#Bruin_key__Yellow_key_">Bruin key (Yellow key)</a></li><li><a href="#Terrapin_key__Green_key_">Terrapin key (Green key)</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Tips_and_tricks_to_know_for_finding_and_repairing_Ol__Tessie">Tips and tricks to know for finding and repairing Ol' Tessie</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Ashes_of_the_Damned_s_Wonder_Vehicle_explained">Ashes of the Damned's Wonder Vehicle explained</h2><p dir="ltr">Ol' Tessie is the new Wonder Vehicle for Ashes of the Damned. This map doesn't feature a traditional map layout, and instead, it's a massive map with six main POIs connected by dangerous stretches of road.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start of a match, you're guided through making the first two enhancements to Ol' Tessie, including the powerful Pack-a-Punch upgrade, but then the quest markers disappear. There are more powerful upgrades the game doesn't tell you about, and there are some helpful tools and tricks to help you keep your Wonder Vehicle in good shape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606863" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606863"></a><figcaption>Ol' Tessie</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to always keep moving when you're driving Ol' Tessie on the connecting roads. She's fragile in her beginning state, so you don't want her breaking down and leaving you stranded on the roads. You can repair her with salvage or let her regenerate health over time, but it's really hard to do this and stay alive, especially in a solo match.</p><p dir="ltr">There are glowing plant pods scattered all throughout the roads of the map, and you'll want to swerve around and avoid these, as they explode and deal a lot of damage to your truck. Ravager enemies will also latch on and deal damage, so don't stop until you get to the next POI, and then the Ravagers will disappear.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_fully_upgrade_Ol__Tessie">How to fully upgrade Ol' Tessie</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="T_E_D_D__upgrade">T.E.D.D. upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">The initial quest markers will guide you to the T.E.D.D. part in the spawn area, so you get your first upgrade quickly in your match. You take the part from the Quick Revive room and interact with Ol' Tessie to install it.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pack_a_Punch_upgrade">Pack-a-Punch upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">After making the first upgrade, your quest marker will then guide you to Ashwood. You'll need to follow your objective markers to turn on the power here, and then you can access the garage. This is where you'll add the Pack-a-Punch upgrade, as well as the additional hidden upgrades mentioned below.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that this Pack-a-Punch upgrade means you can always upgrade your guns on the go. You can even use the machine from the truck bed without ever getting out.</p><p dir="ltr">This Pack-a-Punch upgrade also adds a boost to the truck, so you can flee those pesky Ravagers and get to your location even faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606865-abominationcarcass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606865" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606865-abominationcarcass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606865"></a><figcaption>Abomination Carcass part in the diner's freezer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606865-abominationcarcass.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Abomination_upgrade">Abomination upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">The next upgrade will add the monstrous mouths of the Abomination creature from Black Ops 6. To do this, you'll need to head to Exit 115. A special zombie called "The Cook" will spawn in or around the diner. Kill this zombie and <strong>pick up the freezer key</strong> that it drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Go inside the diner and use the key on the locked freezer. This lets you grab the Abomination Carcass upgrade. Take the part back to the garage in Ashwood to install it via the upgrade bench.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Abomination Heads upgrade, you'll be able to use R1/RB to shoot beams from the Abomination's mouths. This will help kill enemies in your path.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Turret_upgrade">Turret upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">This final upgrade takes time and a lot of effort to collect parts, and one of them won't be available until after round 15.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s push to make Windows 11 a fully AI PC operating system continues, with the company planning to roll out new AI agents that can complete tasks and make changes on your behalf. But the company isn’t turning the AI feature on by default because there’s a risk of it downloading and installing malware. Oops!</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-warns-security-risks-agentic-os-windows-11-xpia-malware">As spotted by <em>Windows Central</em></a><em>, </em>Microsoft recently published a lengthy warning about the AI agents it will soon add to Windows 11. In the post, Microsoft explains that agents will have their own accounts on your Windows 11 PC. They’ll also have “limited access to your user profile directory” and, if needed, will be granted read and write access to certain folders, including Documents, Downloads, and Desktop. And while Microsoft claims that all AI decisions must be approved by a human and all actions will be logged and reported, the tech giant acknowledges that activating these agents could be a bad idea.</p>

 <p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">In the warning,</a> Microsoft straight up says that its AI agents introduce “novel security risks” like, oh, I don’t know, being able to send off your data without you realizing it, being tricked by online commands, or even installing harmful software. Here’s the full warning:</p> <blockquote><p>As these capabilities are introduced, AI models still face functional limitations in terms of how they behave and occasionally may hallucinate and produce unexpected outputs. Additionally, agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.</p></blockquote> <p>Now that seems very bad to me, a person who likes to keep malware off my PC. And Microsoft agrees, because when these agents are added in a future update, they will need to be manually activated by the user. So at the very least, if you are running Windows 11, you don’t have to worry about AI agents installing some malware on your PC while you’re off grabbing a snack. For now. Microsoft is pushing AI hard in all its products, including Xbox, and I wouldn’t be surprised if one day these AI agents in Windows 11 are just turned on by default. Anyway, remember how Xbox is teasing that its next console will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox/607616/microsoft-amd-next-gen-xbox-pc/">basically be a Windows-powered PC?</a>&nbsp;Cool stuff. So happy about that.</p>

                <p>If you've accepted the Our Presence Up There quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll need to visit the Pattern House on Dam Battlegrounds and perform a few quick tasks. It's a relatively straightforward quest, but knowing where each objective is located can make things move much more quickly--which can be important in a high-traffic area like the Pattern House.</p><p>You don't need to extract to complete Our Presence Up There, but you'll be pretty close to an extraction point, so you might as well try to get out alive if possible. Additionally, the Pattern House is often home to a lot of really good loot (especially during a Night Raid), making it worth trying to haul some stuff back to Speranza.</p><p>When you're ready to get started on Our Presence Up There, follow the guide below.</p><h2>How to complete Our Presence Up There in Arc Raiders</h2><p>To complete Our Presence Up There, you'll need to head to the Pattern House POI, which is located at the northern tip of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This is a spot a lot of folks visit for blueprint farming, as well as a common spawn point, so keep an eye out for other raiders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606794" data-ratio="0.56268958543984" data-width="1978" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606794"></a><figcaption>Pattern House location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Pattern House, enter through the front and head to the staircase on the bottom floor.

Here, at the edge of the roof, is an antenna with a terminal.

This extraction point is usually crawling with ARC and is often camped by other raiders, though, so approach it carefully if you're carrying anything particularly valuable--and be ready for a fight if necessary.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"i really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Vedinad, developer of Megabonk, has withdrawn his game from The Game Awards following its nomination for Best Debut Indie Game, saying it doesn't qualify for the category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post to Twitter/X</a> from the official Megabonk account, vedinad made the announcement today:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm withdrawing from The Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game 🥸</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"i really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. you should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"thanks again! new megabonk update coming soon ✌️"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 2.23pm PT: </strong>Megabonk was listed as a nominee under Best Debut Indie, along with Blue Prince, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Despelote, and Dispatch. Since this statement, The Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley has shared a statement of his own acknowledging the request and stating that Megabonk would be removed <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a Twitter/X post</a>. At the time of this update, Megabonk was still listed on The Game Awards website as a nominee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"@MegabonkGame, a nominee for Best Debut Indie Game, reached out to clarify that he is an established solo developer who had been presenting himself as a new creator under the name Vedinad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re grateful for his honesty. As a result, MegaBonk will be removed from the category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He’ll share more about his story when he’s ready, but we respect that he didn’t want to take recognition away from other debut teams — even though the game itself is outstanding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, Best Debut Indie is awarded to the "best debut game created by a new independent studio." So what counts as a new, independent studio? This definition certainly can get a little fuzzy - game dev teams are often Ships of Theseus, with certain groups sticking together, hiring others, and rebranding. For instance, Dispatch was made by AdHoc Studio, and is the team's collective first original game. However, AdHoc was founded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-reportedly-began-as-a-new-splinter-cell-game-by-the-dispatch-developers">by a team of former Ubisoft and Telltale developers who had previously been working together</a>. Cocoon, by Geometric Interactive, won Debut Indie back in 2023 and was arguably in a similar situation with former developers from Playdead. But by that logic, it's also unlikely anyone's "first game" would ever make it to The Game Awards, as most people's first projects are small, student, or experimental.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vedinad's argument at least makes a bit more sense for himself, given that he is effectively a solo developer and has worked on other projects under other names. But even solo developers have help: Miguel Angel, for instance, is credited with the OST, Giovanni Fim made the Steam art, and there are a handful of names listed as playtesters, as well as a "special thanks" to vedinad's mom. Vedinad seems to be as close to a solo dev as anyone really gets. What really is a game studio, anyway?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What this ultimately seems to boil down to is that there's at least some level of confusion about what the categories of The Game Awards actually mean. This isn't the first time this has happened. In 2023, Dave the Diver - a game made by a subsidiary of Korean gaming giant Nexon - was up for Best Indie, leading <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TGA creator Geoff Keighley to respond</a> that indie can "mean different things to different people," and even the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> director admitted the nomination was confusing</a>. We've also seen some oddities like Sifu being up for Best Fighting Game in 2022 (it's an action beat-em-up), and even some recent eyebrow raisers like Monster Hunter Wilds being nominated this year for best RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Define it all however you want, but Megabonk's developer has spoken, as has Keighley. You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">catch up on all the other 2025 nominees right here</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/megabonk-quick-review">check out our early thoughts on Megabonk here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a trading card game kind of day today, with deals so good that I couldn't help but focus in on them. Specifically, I'm talking about Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Air Bender. Not only are there some exciting restocks, but the potential savings today are literally ridiculous.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Booster Boxes for Avatar have been restocked at Amazon, with Phastasmal Flames and Mega Evolution restocks coming in heavy too. I've included where's the best to buy at face value alone in today's article, but the heavy hitting discounts on Amazon come from applying for an Amazon Visa card and using AMEX or Discover to pay $1 on your order to get over 50% off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means free Booster Bundles, Blisters, Premium Collections and Boosters with just the gift card alone. But when considering Booster Boxes, such as Phantasmal Flames or Avatar Collector Booster Box, you'll halve the price left to pay. Let's get into it and i'll guide you through exactly how to do it.</p><p id="magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-l"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The L">Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230696"><div id="230696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best things Nickelodeon put out when I was a kid, and it's fandom still beats strong. This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"> Up to 50% off Pokémon TCG and Free $60 Gift Card</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imagine getting Pokémon TCG Booster Bundles for free, or paying $20 to $30 for an Elite Trainer Box, cool right? Well it's a real deal, and here's how to do it. Start by applying for a Amazon Visa card, then if accepted you'll get an instant $60 Amazon gift card added to your account, which means free Booster Bundles, Premium Collections and Booster Blisters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're after something more expensive and want to knock the price down before using the $60 gift voucher, you'll need an AMEX or Discovery card. By paying $1 on your Pokémon TCG items in your basket, you'll receive an automatic discount up to 50%. So whatever you need to pay after the gift card is cut in half. That's not bad when you're talking Elite Trainer Boxes and Booster Boxes. If this discount doesn't apply, check the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31VGq?object_uuid=d80120ca-bbf4-4fed-bfed-cb314e194b09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">loyalty page on Amazon to see if you're eligible</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TCGPlayer 10% Cashback Black Friday Event </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You read that right, everything is eligibe too. Buy something, get 10% back as in-store credit. With sets like Mega Evolution and Phantasmal Flames finding new floors, this is 100% the best time to fill those gaps in your binder. The sale kicks off on Black Friday, November 28. and ends on Cyber Monday December 1.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra Resin 3D Printer Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra line of Resin printers are perfect for anything that needs intricate detail, especially the 16k model, although the standard ultra does an amazing job too. The Saturn 4 Ultra and Mercury V3.0 wash is a perfect starter kit for anyone wanting to get into the hobby.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elegoo FDM Printer Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What if I said I printed a full sized Stormtrooper helmet on a Neptune 4 Max in one go? It was such a fun project and this printer can handle some insane projects on the large and small side. In fact all of these FDM 3D printers are great for printing anything practical. I'm looking at you cosplayers.</p><p id="meta-quest-3s-128gb-amazon-exclusiv"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Meta Quest 3S 128GB (Amazon Exclusiv">Meta Quest 3S 128GB (Gorilla Tag Bundle) </h2></p><p id="teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-la"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The La">TMNT: The Last Ronin Box Set</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230604"><div id="230604" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Preorder: Releases November 25</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin Box Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set contains three hardcover graphics novels encompassing the TMNT: The Last Ronin continuity. That includes "Lost Years", "The Last Ronin", and "The Last Ronin II: Re-Evolution". I won't spoil them for you, but this is one of the best series i've ever read, and I'm not a massive TMNT fan. And you won't be charged for your preorder until this bad boy ships. Not a bad deal at all with that cheeky 25% off.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-annive"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Annive">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230603"><div id="230603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Final Fantasy fans who haven't played the 2D old school games, or for those who are fans of the sprite-based RPG vibe, this is the deal for you. It features a re-arranged soundtrack by original series c omposer Nobuo Uematsu, improved gamplay, a user interface overhaul, auto battle options and more quality of life improvements. 47% off makes this collection a no-brainer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<section><p>Metaphor: ReFantazio actor Caleb Yen spoke to GameSpot about his most memorable moments and lines from the critically acclaimed RPG.</p></section>

                <p>Though this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/">awards season</a> is just around the corner, lately I've found myself reminiscing about my favorite game of 2024 and, coincidentally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/">GameSpot's 2024 Game of the Year</a>: Metaphor: ReFantazio. The fantasy RPG quickly captivated me upon its release late last year for myriad reasons, but perhaps what impressed me most about Metaphor was Atlus' ability to make this high-stakes, fantastical adventure ultimately feel grounded and deeply human.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps this shouldn't have been as surprising as it was considering Atlus's catalog of games, many of which tactfully explore ideas like mortality, oppression, and self-actualization. But whereas the Persona titles and the studio's one-off games like Catherine are still rooted in real-life, Metaphor offered a dramatic departure from our world. A large part of what grounds this, of course, is the game's writing and overarching story, but another part of what truly makes this work are the Metaphor's fantastic performances.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, I was delighted when the actor behind Metaphor's protagonist, Caleb Yen, volunteered to answer some questions about his performance and time spent working on the game. Yen opened up to GameSpot about his favorite lines, how to inject humor into an earnest character, and that awkwardness that comes with playing a game he's in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606806-4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606806" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606806-4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606806"></a><figcaption>Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606806-4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Prior to Metaphor: ReFantazio, Atlus had largely shied away from having fully voiced protagonists. What was it like learning you'd be tasked with realizing one of the </strong><strong>studio's lead characters?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Caleb Yen:</strong> To be honest, when I got the booking email I kind of freaked out–[but] in a positive, screamy, "Oh my God, I'm so psyched for this" way. Getting to voice the protagonist for so many key story moments, and even having some weighty monologues in the latter half of the game, was such a gift.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One thing I loved about your performance was how much humor you brought </strong><strong>to the role. How did you go about balancing your portrayal of someone who is largely a </strong><strong>very earnest and noble character, yet can be a bit awkward or goofy at times?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We all have layers, you know? Even when stuff is weighty, or crazy things are happening, we usually still get a little humor in there--a little silliness. I think the protagonist is the same way, especially because when we meet him in the story, he isn't really a fighter. All of this is new to him. He is on this journey for the right reasons, he wants justice for his best friend and the kingdom, but he can also be a silly little guy sometimes because he doesn't always know what's going on. But he grows as the story progresses, and that was really amazing to play.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I'd love to hear what your thoughts were when you first read the game's story. What </strong><strong>moments stood out to you the most? Which storylines were you most drawn to?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">First off, I just thought the story was incredible. The worldbuilding in Metaphor: ReFantazio is fantastic with all of the different tribes and how they interact, as well as the history of the world itself. Every character makes the decisions they make because of the world they live in and how society has affected them, and that's just peak writing.</p><p dir="ltr">I love how deeply the companion stories are written. Any one of these guys could be the protagonist of their own game. Strohl is dealing with so much responsibility and survivor's guilt, Heismay is juggling being an outcast with mourning for his son, and Hulkenberg feels disgraced as a knight but her duty truly goes beyond her title. And that's only getting into the first three companions! I love my weird found family!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606805-4378504-metaphorrefantazio%E2%80%94awakenofficialtrailer_summergamefest20240-41screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4606805" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606805-4378504-metaphorrefantazio%E2%80%94awakenofficialtrailer_summergamefest20240-41screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4606805"></a><figcaption>The protagonist stands beside Gallica, Strohl, and Hulkenberg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606805-4378504-metaphorrefantazio%E2%80%94awakenofficialtrailer_summergamefest20240-41screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Forging bonds is a huge part of Metaphor: ReFantazio, so I'd love to know which bonds </strong><strong>you had the most fun bringing to life. Are there certain actors you felt you had </strong><strong>remarkable chemistry with, or characters whose stories felt particularly impactful?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">All of them were so good! For actors I had chemistry with, all of my stuff with Gallica was way fun to play because Alejandra Reynoso and I had previously worked together. Our characters had a similar relationship in a different title, where she sort of acted as my older sister or parental figure, so getting to have her as a fairy guide here just made sense.</p><p dir="ltr">Heismay's story hit me like a truck. Following this older guy on his journey, learning about how he just wanted to help his people by interacting with other tribes but got ostracized for it, and then seeing him mourn for the loss of his son and try to find a final resting place…it was just so powerful.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How is it going back and playing a game you voiced the main character in? Do you find it a bit awkward or difficult?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">A little bit! I hear myself so much when I'm playing! But it's also just really cool to be a part of such a fantastic game and I'm so proud of the work I and the rest of the cast did, as well as the team in general, so I get over it pretty quickly.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are one or two of your favorite voice lines you delivered in Metaphor: ReFantazio? Which of your colleagues' lines are most memorable to you?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps unsurprisingly, I had so much fun with the "Awaken!" line. I'm also a huge Persona fan, so getting to say, "Persona!" was pretty dreamy. At some point I say something like "a ghost," which made me laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">[Yet] nothing sticks in my head more than Philippe Spall roaring, "Oh power of kings!" as Heismay. This little bat guy <em>looks </em>like a mascot character but he is <em>not</em>--he's so awesome.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the entirety of the scene where everyone is banging stuff together to call Heismay out. I love those line deliveries--it's so funny! Did I mention I love my weird found family?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things that really pushed my love for Metaphor over the edge was </strong><strong>the unabashed social commentary. What was it like voicing this game in the midst of a </strong><strong>really tumultuous time period, politically?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think Metaphor: ReFantazio has themes that are truly universal. Every character is dealing with expectations society puts on them due to how they were born, who their people are, their family's position, and a bunch of other factors they can't control. They have to balance all of that with what they truly want in life, who they want to be true to, and pursue the ending that matters the most to them. It's an amazing game because each character truly feels tied to the lore and story that is uniquely Metaphor: ReFantazio, and I'm so thankful to be a part of it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>

		<p>Balancing Monkey Games has confirmed that its space based city builder Beyond These Stars will not be released into early access this year, with 2026 now being the target. However, those of you who want to try out building a city on the back of a space whale you can try out the demo which gives a taster of what to expect when Beyond These Stars does eventually release.</p>

<p>In a post, Balancing Monkey Games said, <em>“We’re going to be taking a little more time to make sure the Early Access release is truly amazing, so we’ve had to make the hard decision to delay Early Access back into 2026. We understand that this is not quite the launch date we had initially envisioned, but after some testing at the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025, we realised that there was so much more we could bring to the game and really make it something special. The team at Balancing Monkey Games have been hunkering down to make some big changes, including game mechanics and in-game rewards. There are new buildings to discover, perks to unlock, and player guides to interact with. Building placement, greenery, and pollution have a greater impact on gameplay, and core systems have been refined. Player actions have a more noticeable impact on Kewa, affecting not just your relationship with the Space Whale, but the look and behaviour of their biome too. Be sure to download the new demo and experience the changes for yourself!”</em></p>
<p>In Beyond These Stars, a people called the Peeps find themselves living on the back of the space whale Kewa, which gives them an opportunity to build a home. However, there will be challenges for players to face when building a society on top of a sentient creature including your relationship with it. Expand too quickly and overwork the land on Kewa, and there will be fewer resources with the land shrinking. Kewa is not the only location for the Peeps to build on either, as the universe is filled with resources and outposts can be built to extract them. There are other civilisations to meet out there too, and they will judge you on how you treat Kewa.</p>

      <div><p>An official <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair is happening. The iconic characters from Capcom's acclaimed action RPG series are making the jump to Wizards of the Coast's acclaimed card game, bringing some monstrous fury to the table.</p>



<p>In a press release, Wizards of the Coast confirms that they will be releasing a <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop that will go on sale starting on December 1, 2025, and ending on December 21, 2025. That superdrop will include four drops of cards featuring the ferocious beasts of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a> series.</p>

As such, it reimagines noncreature spells with some larger-than-life characters. The cards in the drop are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Blind Obedience </em>(Featuring Malzeno and Qurio)</li>
	<li><em>Snap </em>(Featuring Kushala Daora)</li>
	<li><em>Village Rites </em>(Featuring Magnamalo and Tobi-Kadachi)</li>
	<li><em>Mizzium Mortars </em>(Featuring Yian Garuga)</li>
	<li><em>Tooth and Nail </em>(Featuring Azure Rathalos and Seregios)</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-monster-hunter-secret-lair-the-hunters-promo.jpg?itok=MWEFFEr5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-monster-hunter-secret-lair-the-hunters-promo.jpg?itok=yZFrI804 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Drop number two of the <em>Magic: The Gathering Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop focuses on the brave ones who hunt these monsters. Each card features a unique set of armor and weapons, which are the key to progression throughout the Monster Hunter series. The drop contains the following:</p>

<ul><li><em>Grand Abolisher</em>&nbsp;as Dual-Bladed Hunter</li>
	<li><em>Archeomancer&nbsp;</em>as <em>Hero of Hoarfrost Reach</em></li>
	<li><em>Grim Haruspex</em>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<em>Nargacuga Stalker</em></li>
	<li><em>Imperial Recruiter&nbsp;</em>as&nbsp;<em>Bherna Huntmaster</em></li>
	<li><em>Champion of Lambholt&nbsp;</em>as&nbsp;<em>Champion of Kotoko</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-monster-hunter-secret-lair-the-monsters-promo.jpg?itok=dWkqCpjB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-monster-hunter-secret-lair-the-monsters-promo.jpg?itok=o7RTaNXc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The third and fourth drops place the monsters centerstage, reimagining nine of the franchise's most iconic beasts as Legendary Creatures. Those cards are the following:</p>

<ul><li><em>Nezahal Primal Tide</em> as <em>Lagiacrus, Lord of the Seas</em></li>
	<li><em>Drakuseth, Maw of Flames</em> as <em>Rathalos, King of the Skies</em></li>
	<li><em>Ziatora the Incinerator</em> as <em>Fatalis,&nbsp; the Black Dragon</em></li>
	<li><em>Vaevictis Asmadi, the Dire</em> as <em>Nergigante, Herald of Destruction</em></li>
	<li><em>Sarulf, Realm Eater</em> as <em>Zinogre, Lord of Lightning</em></li>
	<li><em>Razaketh, the Foulblooded</em> as <em>Gore Magala, Dark Eclipse</em></li>
	<li><em>Kalamax, the Stormsire</em> as <em>Brachydios, Brutish Indigo</em></li>
	<li><em>Wasitora, Nekoru Queen</em> as <em>Nargacuga, Ever-Present Shadow</em></li>
	<li><em>Amareth, the Lustrous</em> as <em>Velkhana, Silver Sovereign</em></li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, no MSRP has been displayed for the <em>Magic: The Gathering Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair drops. Though given how consistent other Secret Lair crossovers (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em></a>, The Office, etc.) have been priced, there's a good chance non-foil will be around $30 and foil will be around $40.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A bus load of Homer Simpsons appeared with little warning in Southern California earlier today. And it’s all part of an elaborate marketing stunt to promote the newest update to the ongoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296"><em>Fortnite x Simpsons</em> season</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, after plenty of teasing and leaks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">Epic released a massive update for <em>Fortnite</em></a> that changed the game into a big ol’ <em>Simpsons</em> crossover, complete with a new island that is modeled after the long-running animated show’s Springfield. The season has been a big hit for Epic, and each week in November, Epic and Disney (the owners of <em>The Simpsons</em>) have published new animated <em>Simpsons</em> short telling a story of what happens when <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em>Fortnite</em> collides with the longest-running sitcom in history</a>. And the season’s next update involves a lot of Homers, with some of them spilling into our reality.</p> <p>On November 18,&nbsp; a few dozen people wearing Homer Simpson costumes invaded the Promenade in Santa Monica, California. You can see what that looks like in the video uploaded by Santa Monica Closeup on YouTube earlier today. You’ll also spot a Peely-fied version of Professor Frink, too. This new <em>Fortnite</em> season is weird.</p>

  <p><a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1990733727857582299">As reported by<em> Discussing Film</em> on Twitter,</a> the horde of Homers was also spotted at a donut shop in the area, where they then proceeded to take it over and cause chaos. I assume the owners gave permission and were paid, but imagine being a random person walking in there for some coffee and a glazed donut and running face-first into 12 Homer mascots ripping the place apart.</p> <p>The cloned Homers are part of the next update for <em>Fortnite</em>, as seen in the short below, and will start appearing in the game on November 19. And Epic, please stop adding character skins based on <em>Simpsons</em> characters. I only have so much money.</p>

No, it’s not about microtransactions or a bad character design, as often happens with gacha games. Instead, it’s because a character allegedly made an infamous penis-pinching gesture called “crab hand.”&nbsp; </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>While the pinch gesture has been used to signal a small size or portion of something forever, it’s also been used in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalia"><span>Korean feminist movement Megalia</span></a><span> to insinuate someone has a small dick. Some men are apparently taking two fingers close together as a personal attack whenever they see it, including in video games.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ko" dir="ltr">[특정 모션 관련 안내]</p> <p>안녕하세요 마왕님,<br>현재 이슈가 되고 있는 출시 예정 캐릭터의 특정 모션에 대한 마왕님 여러분의 의견을 확인하였습니다.</p> <p>먼저, 여러 마왕님께서 해당 장면으로 인해 불편함을 느끼신 점에 대해서 진심으로 사과드립니다.</p> <p>다만, 해당 모션의 경우 우려하시는 것과 달리,…</p> <p>— 스텔라 소라 (@StellaSoraKR) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellaSoraKR/status/1989975324877295896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Yostar’s apology was published on the game’s Korean X account, as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory"><span>the conspiracy</span></a><span> that this signal is being put into art to emasculate men originates in South Korea. This all started because Fuyuka, an upcoming character in </span><i><span>Stella Sora</span></i><span>, has her pointer finger and thumb lined up in such a way </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/born2beslicker.bsky.social/post/3m5wcel54qc2e"><span>during one of her animations</span></a><span> that if someone wanted to pretend to see a gesture making fun of people’s dick size, they could do so. Once the internet took that and ran with it, Yostar </span><a href="https://x.com/StellaSoraKR/status/1990314017995575774"><span>updated the animation</span></a><span> so that Fuyuka now has a closed fist in the relevant scene.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000645273" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645273"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645273">© Yostar / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Stella Sora </span></i><span>isn’t the only game that has had to apologize and alter its work to avoid accusations of sneaking in misandrist dog whistles. </span><i><span>Stellar Blade </span></i><span>developer Shift Up also recently </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-crab-hand-small-penis-hateful-expression-apology-nikke-2000640487"><span>issued an apology</span></a><span> for art celebrating the anniversary of its RPG, </span><i><span>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</span></i><span>. That character did not look like it was pinching anything either, but because</span> <span>the fingers were parallel to each other and one was bent, kinda, the team edited it to remove any doubt.

<p>"It's an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately I don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game' I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game," the developer said.</p><p>They added: "I really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. You should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games! Thanks again!"</p><p>As of yet, representatives for The Game Awards have not responded to Megabonk's announcement, nor has organizer Geoff Keighley. If the game is indeed withdrawn from the official ballot, it remains to be seen if another title could take its place. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>Megabonk was released in September on PC and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3405340/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached an all-time peak of more than 100,000 concurrent players.</a></p><p>The $10 game that has "Very Positive" reviews on Steam has players smashing their way through ongoing waves of enemies. A new update is "coming soon," the developer said, though it's unclear what's in the update.</p><p>As for games that are still nominated, that's all of them except Megabonk, including the Game of the Year nominees: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hades II, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p><p>For more, check out all the nominees in the gallery below.</p>

              <p><span>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched this summer, a cheaper, Japanese-only version of the console was made available domestically. Some speculated the more affordable console (which cost around $340 compared to the multi-language Switch 2’s $480) was offered to address a weak yen or the cost of living in Japan, but whatever the reason, it helped: the Switch 2 was Japan’s biggest ever console launch, according <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-is-by-far-japans-biggest-ever-console-launch-likely-clearing-1-million-units/">to <em>VGC</em></a></span><i><span>.&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>In June, the other Japanese gaming behemoth, Sony, said it was keeping an eye on the Switch 2 in terms of competition, but wasn’t all that concerned because of the PlayStation 5’s “differentiated strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/606826/sony-ps5-vs-switch-2-sales/"><span>as reported by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishini said that the PlayStation 5 was “the best place of play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“We believe PS5’s level of performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering to players and creators in this current console generation,” Nishino said.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>But over the last few weeks, Sony has displayed a renewed interest in its Japanese market, holding a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049"><span>Japan-centric State of Play on November 11</span></a><span> that focused on games developed in the region, and also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085"><span>announced a cheaper PS5 that</span></a><span>, similar to the Switch 2, is only for use in Japan. It’s the first region-locked console Sony has released since the PlayStation 2, and a new report suggests this maneuver may be because Sony is finally considering Nintendo a proper competitor.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to a report from </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/playstation-ceo-pushed-through-cut-price-ps5-in-japan-after-seeing-system-slump-against-switch-2"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span> (based on a translation from </span><a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/media-create-sales-week-45-2025-nov-03-nov-09.4147/page-7#post-367685"><span>Install Base user Hartmann</span></a><span>, which lines up with machine translation of the segment), Japanese media outlet </span><a href="https://txbiz.tv-tokyo.co.jp/original2/vod/post_329817"><i><span>TV Tokyo</span></i></a><span> discussed the price drop with local experts, who suggested that Sony wasn’t bothered by PlayStation’s shrinking market in Japan until hearing of Nintendo’s cheaper Switch 2. According to the </span><i><span>TV Tokyo </span></i><span>segment, Sony executives decided to ape Nintendo’s approach, and allegedly approved the PS5 price cut in just four months.</span></p> <p><span> The reporters also suggest that Sony president Nishino, who stepped into the role this past April after taking over for Dutch-born Hermen Hulst, felt so strongly about PlayStation’s flagging brand in Japan (Nishino is Japanese) that he helped push the region-specific console to market.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Japanese-only digital version of the PS5 goes on sale on November 21.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-peacock-third-season-new-showrunner/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A third season of Peacock’s Twisted Metal, based on the PlayStation racing series, has been announced. However, the renewal does come with the news of a change in showrunners.</p>







<p>Debuting in 2023, Twisted Metal loosely adapts the games from the early PlayStation era. Featuring fan-favorite characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sweet-tooth-is-a-violent-man-in-twisted-metal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Tooth</a>, the show was a surprise success for Peacock. It helped that the show sported massive talent like Captain America’s Anthony Mackie and Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Stephanie Beatriz. A second season was quickly greenlit and released earlier this year to decent reviews. Now, Peacock has revealed that the action show is coming back for another season, but not without some creative changes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Variety first covered the news that Twisted Metal is being <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/twisted-metal-renewed-season-3-david-reed-showrunner-1236584674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">renewed for a third season</a>. Apparently, the second season was a hit for Peacock, being the second returning original scripted season with 993 million minutes watched. However, it isn’t without changes, as show creator and showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith is exiting. The Cobra Kai creator’s reasons for leaving has not been discussed. In his stead, writer and director David Reed will join current showrunners Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. No other details, like casting or release, is available.</p>



<p>David’s resume is quite a good one, from a glance. His most notable project is as a writer for Prime Video’s The Boys, which is releasing its final season in 2026. Other titles he has worked on include Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Supernatural, among others. While Michael Jonathan Smith’s departure is a sad one, Reed does seem like a great substitute. </p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried to hook an old Nintendo 64 up to a modern HDTV, you know the results can be less than ideal. Assuming your original hardware still works and your flatscreen even has the requisite R/F and/or composite inputs to allow for the connection, the N64’s output will probably look like a blurry mess on a flatscreen that wasn’t designed with those old video signals as a priority.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D solves this very specific problem very well, with a powerful FPGA core that accurately replicates a Nintendo 64 and well-made display filters that do a good job of approximating that cathode-ray tube glow you remember from decades ago. But the lack of easy expandability limits the appeal of this $250 device to all but the most die-hard fans of original N64 hardware.</p>
<h2>A beauty to behold</h2>
<p>As a piece of physical design, the Analogue 3D is a work of art. The gentle curves of its sleek black shell evoke the original N64 design without copying it, coming in at a slightly smaller footprint and height. Plus, there’s no ugly power brick.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>3D COMPUTER GRAPHICS SYSTEM.</span>
                    <span>

          </p>
  </div>

<p>This is a solidly built device, with a nice grippy underside and springy, elegant power and reset buttons. The shell has a lot of small, thoughtful touches, too, like a front power indicator that doubles as a Bluetooth sync button and lights on each controller port to indicate when a wireless controller is connected to that slot (the Hall Effect joysticks on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Analogue-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DK6VCGBC">8bitdo’s wireless “64” controller</a> are a joy compared to the crunchy mechanical sticks on your old N64 controller).</p>
<p>The one downside to this design is that the hardware can get slightly hot after running for a while, and it emits some noticeable fan noise when stressed. The welcome screen when you first boot the system recommends you give the vents adequate space to breathe, so be careful if you plan to place it directly on the carpet or something.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>I saw the TV glow</h2>
<p>The Analogue 3D’s custom 3DOS software automatically detects the game cartridge you’ve placed into its top-loading slot and displays basic info like player count, developer/publisher, and release date on-screen (you can also load your own custom cartridge images onto an included SD card). The system maintains this info in a scrollable list of every cartridge you’ve ever inserted, allowing for a quick way to browse through your library without the need to dig out your actual cartridges. You do have to plug in the cartridges to actually play the games, though, which limits the usefulness of the on-screen library more than a little bit.</p>



<p>Before you launch a game, you can also configure the Display Mode between five preset options (these can also be swapped during gameplay using controller hotkeys for an on-screen menu). Of these, you’ll generally want to stay away from the “Clean” option, which upscales the N64’s 320×240 image by simply blowing up each individual pixel to fit the display. The result is an incredibly blocky image with lots of jagged edges and blobs of color that refuse to blend well with nearby elements. It’s a look that’s especially unsuited to the low-resolution textures on most N64 games, which exploited the gentle blur of a CRT to create some vivid effects.</p>
<p>Switching over to the “Scanlines” display option helps a bit in rounding out those jagged N64 polygons, but things really start to look better if you activate one of the system’s three different CRT emulation modes. With these, 3DOS does its best to recreate the look of an electron beam actually scanning across the phosphors on an old tube TV. These filters do an admirable job of softening the hard edges of polygons and sprites while subtly and accurately blending the colors on those low-res textures.</p>

<p>The Analogue 3D has three tube TV emulation modes, each representing consumer CRTs and the kind of Pro/Broadcast Video Monitors you’d usually only find in TV station control rooms. You can go into the menus for each mode and tinker with settings like “beam convergence” and “edge hardness,” and you can toggle N64 hardware effects like anti-aliasing and de-blurring (you can also stretch the 4:3 image to fill a 16:9 display if you’re a specific kind of monster).</p>
<p>In general, though, I didn’t see much upside in this kind of settings tinkering. Using the system’s default “CRT” settings created a visual experience that was surprisingly authentic to the actual CRT sitting in my home office. The only thing really missing is an option to simulate the curve of a classic CRT; the hard square edges of the Analogue 3D output are a bit lacking on that score. But that’s a minor complaint for a filter that does such a good job mimicking an old TV on new display technology.</p>

<h2>Open and shut</h2>
<p>Like previous Analogue hardware, the Analogue 3D uses <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/100dw5h/for_dummies_what_is_fpga_what_is_it_used_for/">FPGA</a> to accurately recreate the inner workings of an N64 at the level of individual logic gates. This time, the Analogue 3D’s Altera Cyclone FPGA sports a whopping 220,000 logic elements. That’s a big step up from the two FPGAs on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">2021’s Analogue Pocket</a>, which have just 49,000 and 15,000, respectively.</p>


<p>That powerful FPGA allows for perfectly accurate and lag-free N64 emulation in all of our tests with original cartridges (Analogue’s Christopher Taber warns us that “flash carts and unofficial 3rd party products can be a bit of a wild card”). But players hoping to emulate other gaming systems with that powerful hardware may run into some problems. That’s because the Analogue 3D doesn’t support the OpenFPGA standard that Analogue itself <a href="https://www.analogue.co/developer">rolled out in 2022</a> as “the future of video game preservation.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>That standard has allowed a vibrant community of OpenFPGA developers to create <a href="https://openfpga-library.github.io/analogue-pocket/">dozens of free “cores”</a> that can recreate everything from classic arcade games to 16-bit consoles with amazing fidelity. Currently, though, those cores will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/flurry-of-firmware-updates-makes-analogue-pocket-an-even-better-retro-handheld/">only work on the Analogue Pocket</a>&nbsp;and not subsequent hardware like the Analogue 3D or <a href="https://www.analogue.co/duo">2023’s Analogue Duo</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a shame because the OpenFPGA community would certainly be happy to get their hands on the new, larger FPGA in the Analogue 3D to build out core support for even more classic gaming consoles. And we’re sure Analogue 3D owners would be happy to use their purchase to play existing OpenFPGA cores on the big screen, complete with 3DOS’ great display options.</p>

<p>“If we wanted to offer Analogue 3D with OpenFPGA (which is not the purpose or focus of the product), it would require not only a second FPGA, but an even more powerful base FPGA, therefore increasing the price to a price that doesn’t suit our goals,” Analogue founder Christopher Taber <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/analogues-hardware-emulated-nintendo-64-fpga-console-will-arrive-in-2024/">told Ars</a> when the system was first announced back in 2023.</p>
<p>It seems likely that hackers and tinkerers will be able to expand the Analogue 3D’s emulation capabilities in the future. As it stands, though, it’s hard to recommend the hardware when options like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/youtuber-faces-jail-time-for-showing-off-android-based-gaming-handhelds/">Android-based, emulation-focused handhelds</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/building-a-retro-gaming-super-console-with-100-and-a-raspberry-pi-2022-edition/">Raspberry Pi-based emulation consoles</a>, and even (more expensive) <a href="https://retrorgb.com/mister.html">MiSTer FPGA boxes</a> offer able support for much more than just N64 games.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a simple, plug-and-play way to use your original N64 cartridges and accessories on a modern display, the Analogue 3D offers pretty much everything you could hope for. If you want a single device that can handle more, though, you should look elsewhere.</p>

That certainly appears, on its face, like a pretty solid deal, but on the other hand, Game Pass Ultimate got a significant price bump at the same time Fortnite Crew was added, so there are some other factors you might want to take into account before signing up.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's take a look at the details to see what kind of value this really is.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</a></li><li><a href="#What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_">What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs </a></li><li><a href="#Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes a large library of games for both Xbox and PC, including most titles published by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which include Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Yes, that includes the newly released Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Ultimate plan is the only version of Game Pass that is guaranteed to include new games published under the Xbox banner on day one, and it's also the only tier to include subscriptions from two other publishers--Ubisoft Classics, and EA Play. </p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew benefits are exactly the same if you subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate as they would be if you bought a standalone Crew subscription. You get access to the current battle pass, music pass, OG pass, and Lego Pass as long as you're subscribed, you'll receive 1,000 V-Bucks and a Crew skin each month you're subscribed, and you'll also get the premium Rocket Pass for Rocket League.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_"><span>What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $30 a month, a sizable jump from its previous price of $20. By itself, Fortnite Crew costs $12 per month.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are many ways to play Xbox these days, including consoles, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, and on handhelds like the ROG Xbox Ally--and all Game Pass games are playable via any of those methods. To receive your Crew benefits, you'll need to log in to Fortnite on any of the above-mentioned Xbox platforms at least once each month, and then you can use those benefits while playing on any other platform.</p><p dir="ltr">But it wouldn't make a lot of sense to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate unless you plan to play some of the other games that are included. It's not a good value to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate <em>just </em>for Crew.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate while you have an active Fortnite Crew subscription through Xbox, the Crew subscription will automatically be canceled. The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/fortnite-crew-xbox-game-pass-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official FAQs</a> do not say whether you'd receive a pro-rated refund or credit for additional time that might have been remaining on your Crew subscription in that situation, but it would be standard practice to do so.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're subscribed to Fortnite Crew through, say, the PlayStation Store, you won't get any additional bonuses in Fortnite from being subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate until the subscription on PlayStation ends. So you may want to cancel your existing Crew subscription and let it run out before signing up for Game Pass Ultimate, if the Crew subscription is one of the deciding factors in your purchase.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Doom: The Dark Ages GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Players can choose to have up to five rounds of enemy encounters, with up to 10 waves of enemies each. Other changes are relatively minor, like tweaks to line of sight in arenas and icons now appearing over the heads of the last few remaining enemies in a round. The addition of a passcode system for Ripatorium will make it so players can easily share their demonic arenas with others. Developer Id Software said it will be looking to curate some of the best custom encounters in order to make community-made Ripatorium presets.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 3 is mostly about the Ripatorium, but there are new options are coming to Doom: The Dark Ages' overall gameplay as well, including the ability to swap between Shield Runes and melee weapons in combat. This gives players even more deadly tools at their disposal, as certain runes and melee weapons may excel in some situations but not others. Now, instead of having to go into multiple menus to change them, players can do it on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability to adjust the game's "Brink of Death" state is also new, with players now able to choose between Normal and Hard. On Hard, surviving at low health will be more challenging, as the game won't provide as many resources to help players stabilize. In the campaign, various combat encounters have been adjusted, as have the attacks of certain bosses and enemies like the Cacodemon.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, reviewer Alessandro Barbosa said Id's latest proves there is still plenty of fertile ground for Doom to cover, and that its melee combat "harmonizes beautifully" with the franchise's traditional FPS combat. Doom: The Dark Ages is nominated for best action game and innovation in accessibility at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>
