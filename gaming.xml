			<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii might seems like an incredibly outlandish idea at first glance, but once you think about it for a minute, you realise just how easily it slots into the Yakuza/Like A Dragon universe. Sure, the series is a serious crime drama, but each game has wacky encounters and over the top characters. Goro Majima, our protagonist in Pirate Yakuza, is probably the most outlandish of the main cast of the franchise, to the point that sticking him on a pirate ship and making him a captain barely even raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0B9NbawsHI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set after the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> and, despite being a spin off, does contain major spoilers for that game. So if you have not played Infinite Wealth and want to experience the story without spoilers, get to that before Pirate Yakuza.</p>


<p>The plot in Pirate Yakuza begins with Majima washing up on a small island with a nasty case of amnesia. A young boy called Noah finds him and is set on helping Majima, but very quickly you realise that this is no ordinary island, what with all the pirates. We are talking about pirates with wooden ships armed with cannons, tricorn hats, and lots of treasure. This nautical throwback is down to the pirates searching for treasures in the waters around Hawaii, and taking refuge in the pirate cove of Madlantis – again, this is like an only slightly abnormal situation for Majima. Madlantis is a pure pirate heaven, as an NPC constantly shouts when you are docked there, full of bars, brothels, brawls, and battles. After his run in with the pirates on Rich Island – the island he washed up on – Majima makes his way to Madlantis with a crew in tow.</p>


<p>Piracy has a bit of depth to it. You can go around recruiting people to the crew, if you meet their requirements. These can range from having a sufficient pirate rank to beating them in a fight. Once someone is recruited, you can assign them to a job on your crew, matching their skill rating to a post. Crew can be assigned to the cannons, the ship’s machine guns, or to be part of the boarding party. As you find success in battles on the open sea, and in the Coliseum, experience will be earned by your crew and it does not take too long until they have an A Rank or even S Rank in their skills. The ship itself can be upgraded too with improvements to the hull and through better weapons, visiting Julie’s store once you have the right materials to have her craft things like coconut machine guns and shark cannons.</p>
<p>Once you’re feeling confident, you can sail the waters around Hawaii and other islands to search for treasure and engage in battles with other ships and crews. At first, this is fun. Firing off cannons and machine guns at incoming ships, instructing your crew to repair the ship, switching to deck mode to heal characters and fire a rocket launcher at enemy ships is decent. Then, where it is possible, boarding an enemy ship with your chosen crew to fight a large enemy group is great to see and experience too. However, eventually it all gets a bit samey and when your ship is suitably powered up and your crew levelled up, most challenges become easy enough to sweep aside. The ship’s speed on the water is rather slow too, and even the boost doesn’t feel like it speeds up that much.</p>

<p>The Pirate Coliseum is a great spectacle to witness, where you fight another ship in a massive arena, but all the glitz and glamour can’t hold off that repetitiveness for long. There is a side story here where you hunt dangerous pirates to get hold of cursed instruments, which grant Majima access to new powers to use in fights, but you can make do without them.</p>
<p>In fact, exploring Honolulu as Majima and diving into the classic Yakuza formula was much more fun. While there are much fewer sub stories than the bigger games, Honolulu still has enough to keep you entertained. You can search for treasure in the city, take on a load of bounties (which are also available in Madlantis), complete the challenges, and really dive into the silliness for which the substories are known for – My Dream Minato Girl is a particular highlight. You also have side activities returning such as Dragon Kart and Crazy Eats.</p>

<p>Pirate Yakuza’s combat is fun, with the ability to switch between two styles. You have Majima’s pirate style combat which sees him armed with two cutlasses, a hook rope, and a pistol. You also have a classic brawler style as well, which doesn’t have access to the tools and weapons of pirate style. Having played pretty much all the Yakuza games, I did notice a reduction of Heat move options, which do add an entertaining element to fights. Over the years, Majima has proven to be a creative and chaotic fighter, so a few more options to tap into that would have been welcome.</p>
<p>There is also still the issue around crafting. To get some of the new weapons you need to have the right components, and sometimes you need to craft those components. Unfortunately, you can only craft one component at a time instead doing a batch. If you need 20 quality components, for example, and have the resources to make them, you will be pressing craft 20 times. You can also reach Legends of the Sea rank very easily, and without having to set sail much at all. Just complete the standard challenges, most of which you will do without thinking, and you’ll rise up those ranks. Having it tied to the pirate side alone would have made achieving that rank an accomplishment.</p>
<p>The story is not peak Like A Dragon but it serves its purpose, giving an outlandish yet fitting reason for why Majima has lost his memory, and why so many people are searching for a lost treasure. It has both silly and serious moments, with Majima dishing out a lot of good advice to his young protégé, Noah. The new characters are a welcome addition to the franchise, and I hope that we see them appear in a mainline entry.</p>

The only problem is that the anime (and the compilation film of its early episodes) is called <em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Capital GQ, six Us, capped off with a distinguished capital X to tie the whole vowel-heavy thing together. Is it pronounced “jee-kuuk-ecks” like “Jeez, anime and those kooky mechas?” Do you have to have watched more anime to get it, or is there some untapped phonetic diction unuttered by meager English-speaking tongues to make sense of how to say this anime’s goddamn name? The fuck.</p><p>To make sense of this mess, I asked <a href="https://gizmodo.com/author/ursus-veritas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>io9</em>'s deputy editor James Whitbrook</a> to teach me how to say <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> and SparkNotes the significance behind its esoteric name.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption> © GKids/Bandai Namco FIlmworks<span></span><a href="https://x.com/G_GQuuuuuuX/status/1879136381609644540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> So, what is up with the new <em>Gundam</em> anime's vowel-heavy title? How do you even pronounce that?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> The katakana for the series title is “ジークアクス”, which is pronounced “Jīkuakusu”–we don’t have an English dub yet to see how it’s specifically pronounced, but it’s basically “G-Kwux” as we’d understand it.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Is there lore significance behind the name, or is it simply anime nonsense?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> It’s actually kind of both! The title itself is just a bit of stylization–it’s the official designation of the suit, but no one in the series is saying “G-Kwuuuuuuuuuuuuux” as long drawn out thing or anything. But the name itself comes from a computer science term, Qux, a metasyntactic variable in programming. “Qux” itself is a common placeholder word in coding designed to be replaced at a later date for regular use.</p><p>It makes sense for the show–not to get too deep into spoilers, but the G-Qux itself is a prototype mobile suit when we first encounter it, being used in testing a special piloting interface when it crosses paths with the protagonist, Machu.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Is <em>Gquuuuuux</em>'s pronunciation ever brought up by the mecha animation warlords behind the series or the characters in the movie for reference?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> Yes! It’s referred to by name quite a few times, and is referred to as the G-Qux more than it is a Gundam so far. In fact, there’s a few characters we meet early on that are also confused about its name, so it’s not just us viewers who need to get used to it.</p><figure><figcaption> © GKids/Bandai Namco FIlmworks<span></span><a href="https://x.com/G_GQuuuuuuX/status/1874108891673608415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are there any other <em>Gundam</em> anime with strange names worth explaining, or is <em>Gquuuuuux</em> in a u-shaped league of its own?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> The GQux definitely stands out as particularly odd for a mainline <em>Gundam</em>, but there’s tons of mobile suits across the franchise that have peculiar names that have just become part of the franchise, like the Palace Athene, The O, the Agguguy, the Gelgoog, the Hamma Hamma… The Universal Century shows (those set in the same continuity as the original 1979 <em>Gundam</em>) in particular love some odd names.</p><p>My personal favorites come from <em>Turn A Gundam</em>, the series’ 20th anniversary mainline entry. It’s set in a timeline heavily implied to be a far future of the original <em>Gundam</em>, so a couple of familiar mobile suits appear in the show, but the characters have no clue what their names are, so they give them totally new ones–the Capule became the Kapool, the Zaku became the Borjanon. And that’s even before you get to the show’s actually wildly-named suits, like the “WaD” Walking Dumpling, or stuff like the Mahiroo and Muttowooo. I love <em>Turn A</em>, more people should watch it.</p><hr><p>Mystery solved, and then some.

After 20 years of fans hoping for this day, it’s finally here as part of Cena’s retirement tour leading up to his final WrestleMania in April. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, just so everyone understands what happened, a little history: John Cena has been wrestling in the WWE since 2001. At first he portrayed a rapping villain. Over time he became very popular, and in 2005—after winning his first WWE Championship—he became a babyface aka a good guy in all future storylines and events. And for the last 20 years, as he granted over 600 kids their dreams as part of the Make-A-Wish foundation and became a movie star, he’s remained a babyface despite many wrestling fans wishing he’d turn heel aka become a bad guy again. But with each passing year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1j2de7s/john_cena_heel_turn_after_he_won_the_wwe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1j2de7s/john_cena_heel_turn_after_he_won_the_wwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and as Cena himself joked</a></span> about it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2#:~:text=To%20properly%20execute,his%20inner%20villain.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2#:~:text=To%20properly%20execute,his%20inner%20villain.">it became more and more unlikely that the face of the WWE brand would ever be a villain again</a></span>. And then that changed over the weekend. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25165900-john-cenas-legendary-heel-turn-just-changed-everything-wwe-wrestlemania-41&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25165900-john-cenas-legendary-heel-turn-just-changed-everything-wwe-wrestlemania-41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 1</a></span>, at the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_Chamber:_Toronto#Main_event&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_Chamber:_Toronto#Main_event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE’s Elimination Chamber: Toronto event</a></span>, Cena won the whole thing and was given a championship match against current champ and babyface Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41 in April. But after winning, Rhodes entered the ring and stared Cena down. </p><p>Then the Rock showed up and explained how Rhodes needed to team up with him and give him everything including “his soul.” Rhodes said no and then embraced Cena. But that was when Cena signaled to Rock that he was willing to make that deal, and the soon-to-be-retiring wrestler attacked Rhodes signaling his heel turn. The moment received one of the loudest crowd pops I’ve ever heard as people lost their mind watching Cena finally go bad. <br></p><p>After the historic heel turn, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsPKjOOB5k/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=cd7d9aad-33e3-4f7b-9cfb-b8b19950384e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsPKjOOB5k/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=cd7d9aad-33e3-4f7b-9cfb-b8b19950384e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cena posted an image of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> on Instagram</a></span>, a reference to the meme that we have received so many long awaited things before Rockstar’s open-world sequel. Meanwhile, wrestling fans have started doing what they always do in these moments: Speculate on what will happen next, get excited about the next big event, and explain how actually this wasn’t surprising at all because they saw it coming. </p><p>Regardless of all that, Cena turning heel in the final weeks of his WWE career as he enters his last WrestleMania to face one of the company’s biggest new good guys, Cody Rhodes, feels like a exciting end to one of the greatest wrestling careers of the century. Will he turn back to babyface at the very end? Will he win it all? Will he go out a villain? We’ll have to wait until April to find out, but even I, someone who barely watches wrestling, am excited to see how it all plays out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Kenji Ozawa, the co-director on Visions of Mana, has started a new studio called Studio Sasanqua after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/visions-of-mana-studio-is-shutting-down-just-after-releasing-game-report/1100-6526204/" data-ref-id="1100-6526204">Ouka Studio was shut down by NetEase last year.</a> He's also calling out how management's poor decisions lead to game creators being let go.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-dev-from-netease-games-ouka-studio-establishes-his-own-company-that-wont-push-the-responsibility-of-management-onto-developers/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Ozawa said he wanted to start his own studio because he saw management at his previous companies not taking responsibilities for failed projects.

            <p>Japanese video game producer and design legend Keiji Inafune left Level-5 in the middle of last year, in the middle of development for the next Fantasy Life game.</p>
<p>Level-5 boss Akihiro Hino detailed Inafune's departure in a post on the company's <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/blog/en/">development blog</a>, and described it as an "unexpected challenge" for the Fantasy Life team.</p>
<p>"In mid-2024, Fantasy Life faced an unexpected challenge," Akihiro Hino, CEO of Level-5, wrote. "At that time, producer Keiji Inafune left the company, and we had to reassess and restructure the project."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to Inafune's departure from the company, Hino revealed internal playtests for its upcoming Fantasy Life game - known as Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - had resulted in "harsh evaluations", with changes necessary.</p>
<p>"In response, I decided to take on the role of producer, shifting the core development team from Osaka to our headquarters," Hino said. "While the Osaka team had been dedicated from the start, the project evolved into a collective effort across our whole company - with developers from Fukuoka, Tokyo and beyond, we were able to significantly strengthen our development capabilities."</p>
<p>According to the studio exec, this restructuring allowed the team to expand and "create an environment where we could focus on fine-tuning the game's quality right up until the very end".</p>
<p>Said Hino: "From that point onward, we undertook a complete overhaul of the game: adding open-world exploration and parkour-style actions, restructuring the system's progression flow, improving the core mechanics, and refining the scenario to be even more emotionally impactful."</p>
<p>All of this will "enhance what was already great about the game", Hino continued, stating Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is now nearing completion.</p>

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time in February last year, along with a peek <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/level-5s-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-coming-to-playstation-and-xbox-as-well-as-switch-and-pc">currently slated for release across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via Steam on 21st May</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Two things rubbed players the wrong way about this. </p><p>The first was seemingly locking a cool in-game cosmetic behind a timed-event, leveraging FOMO (fear of missing out) to make fans play the game in an arbitrary way during an arbitrary time period. The second was that both the progress meter for the event and unlocking the cosmetic were busted. </p><p>“This is some of the worst implemented ‘rewards’ system I have ever seen! I played my 6 games of each class on ruthless yesterday, then play some regular lethals while I waited for it to update,” one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iwk0ji/never_do_this_again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iwk0ji/never_do_this_again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> on the<em> Space Marine</em> subreddit early on during the event. “Hours later it said 3/6 so I ran through all 6 again on substantial then went to bed. When I woke up it said 4/6 and now having run all 6 again it’s still on 4/6! I have played a minimum of 21 games in the past 24 hours 18 of them focused on getting this damn helm!”</p><p>Many others <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1ixfas6/this_event_was_sponsored_by_nurgle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1ixfas6/this_event_was_sponsored_by_nurgle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were struggling too</a></span>. The event had to be twice taken offline for fixes, narrowing the 10 day window for it even further. Plus, the whole appeal of <em>Space Marine 2</em> is that it’s not a game you have to constantly keep up with like a second job. In a world of <em>Destiny</em>s,<em> Apex Legendses</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>s, it’s one of the rare online multiplayer shooters where you can log on, have some fun, and then forget about it for a while. Unless you were trying to get the Mark VIII Errant Helmet or other recent event-gated cosmetics. </p><p>“We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items,” <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s developers at Saber Interactive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on February 28. “We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events.

We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining.</p></blockquote><p>So in addition to having community events run more smoothly in the future, Saber also confirmed that their rewards will eventually be circulated into the game for everyone else regardless of whether they were around to participate in the original event or not. It’s unclear if this was always the plan or only something the development team arrived at after the recent Imperial Vigil train wreck.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cache-is-returning-to-counter-strike-but-only-once-valve-approves-it-for-cs2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The fan favorite map Cache is returning to Counter-Strike after its creator remade it for CS2, but Valve has to officially approve it before players can hop back in. After more than half a decade, finally, Cache is back.</p>



<h2 id="h-fmpone-completes-the-cache-remake-for-cs2">FMPONE Completes the Cache Remake for CS2</h2>



<p>Shawn “FMPONE” Snelling, one of Cache’s original creators and a celebrate community map maker for Counter-Strike, has officially returned. FMPONE <a href="https://x.com/FMPONE/status/1896594726738141512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the return of Cache on X (formerly known as Twitter) today, including a couple of screenshots and a link to the official file on the Steam Community workshop. However, the link currently doesn’t work.</p>



<p>FMPONE says this is because “has to approve it first,” expressing his hopes that the approval process will be quick. A number of pro players and creators are celebrating the imminent return of the map already, including North America-based streamer Erik “fl0m” Flom, who <a href="https://x.com/fl0mtv/status/1896595554635030718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implored</a> Valve to “wake up” and approve the map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been more than five years since Cache was featured in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-cs2-active-duty-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Active Duty map pool</a>; the official rotation of balanced maps used in competitive play and tournaments. Cache’s last Major appearance was IEM Katowice 2019, before it was replaced by Vertigo before the start of the StarLadder Berlin Major later that year. Cache has been host to a number of viral moments, including the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQIX-ylS7YU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1v2 falling/no-scope AWP shot clutch</a> from Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev. It also was the site of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkM6QtnL1xM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous mishap</a> from streamer xQc which considered by many to be the worst Counter-Strike highlight ever.</p>



<p>While Cache will likely be playable very soon, don’t expect to see it at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming BLAST.tv Austin Major</a>. It may be some time before it re-enters the Active Duty map pool, especially considering the pool just underwent a change with the arrival of another remade classic, Train.</p>

                <p>The original Twisted Metal helped set the tone for PS1 when it was released in 1995, but it's been absent from Sony's consoles since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/twisted-metal-review/1900-6350421/" data-ref-id="1900-6350421">the Twisted Metal reboot</a> in 2012. However, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-twisted-metal-live-service-game-canceled-report/1100-6521393/" data-ref-id="1100-6521393">an unannounced Twisted Metal live-service game</a>, which could have revived the series had it not been canceled. Now, one of the developers from that lost Twisted Metal game has shared some details about what could have been.</p><p>UI Programmer Hugo Silva posted <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a handful of screenshots</a> from the Twisted Metal live-service game on his site. Unfortunately, the images are blurred with a note stating that they are under a non-disclosure agreement. Unsurprisingly, vehicular combat played a huge role in the game. But the screenshots also include images of third-person shooter gameplay. So clearly the action was meant to spill out of the vehicles as well, which would have been a departure for the franchise.</p><p>The Twisted Metal live-service game was in development at Firesprite, one of the many developers under Sony's PlayStation Studios banner. It appears that Twisted Metal was still very early in development before its cancelation, but the decision to walk away from it came before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">last year's disastrous Concord launch</a> that forced Sony to rethink its commitment to live-service games.</p><p>It's unclear if Sony has any plans to revisit Twisted Metal games in the future, even though the property has some newfound popularity thanks to the live-action TV series on Peacock. The streamer recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sweet-tooth-and-the-gang-return-in-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-2/1100-6529479/" data-ref-id="1100-6529479">a teaser for Twisted Metal Season 2</a>, which will once again feature Anthony Mackie as John Doe, Stephanie Beatriz as Quiet, Will Arnett as the voice of Sweet Tooth, and former AEW World champion Joe Seanoa--aka Samoa Joe--as the on-set actor portraying Sweet Tooth. Barry's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twisted-metal-season-2-casts-barry-star-in-major-role/1100-6524412/" data-ref-id="1100-6524412">Anthony Carrigan is also joining the cast as Calypso</a>, and the series will return to Peacock later this year.</p>

                <p>Former Capcom and Platinum Games director Hideki Kamiya has said that he wants another shot at creating Scalebound, the canceled Xbox game.</p><p>Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, released a video of Kamiya reminiscing about Scalebound while his staff surrounds him. Kamiya talks to his developers about the Scalebound's shooting mechanics and the fact that the main protagonist, Drew, wears headphones and has a smartphone in a world filled with dragons. Kamiya then comments on how Scalebound is like an isekai, a popular genre where a the protagonist from the real world gets transported into a fantasy setting, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forspoken/" data-ref-id="5000-513783">Forspoken</a>.</p><p>While Clovers' Twitter post about the video ends with Kamiya saying he'd love to make it again, the actual video doesn't show it. However, Kamiya confirmed his sentiments by retweeting the post and referring to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, saying, "Let's do it, Phil!"</p><p>Scalebound was initially planned to launch for Xbox One and PC, but was canceled in January 2017. Over the years since its cancellation, Kamiya has shared his desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-scalebound-director-really-does-want-to-revive-the-canceled-game/1100-6500708/" data-ref-id="1100-6500708">to revive the game in some way</a>. There were reportedly talks between its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scalebound-revival-could-happen-following-reported-talks-between-xbox-and-platinum-games/1100-6510627/" data-ref-id="1100-6510627">developer Platinum Games and Microsoft</a> back about doing so, although Spencer confirmed that they've moved on from the project.</p><p>Clovers is currently working on an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/okami-2-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528453/" data-ref-id="1100-6528453">Okami sequel</a> in a partnership with Capcom, which owns the IP rights. Since Microsoft owns the rights to Scalebound, it's possible that a revival could happen. Although it's unclear whether Microsoft would go back to Platinum Games, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/platinum-games-director-hideki-kamiya-leaves-studio/1100-6517960/" data-ref-id="1100-6517960">Kamiya already left</a>, or work with Kamiya at Clovers as he was the game's original director.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/industry-legend-keiji-inafune-left-level-5-last-year.1123920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keiji-inafune-level-5-departure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Industry legend Keiji Inafune left Level-5 last year, the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Professor Layton&nbsp;</em>developer has revealed.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/blog/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">entry</a> on the Level-5 "Five-Star Workshop Devlog", Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino describes the "unexpected challenge" faced by upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a May release</a>&nbsp;after having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">suffered</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delays</a>.</p>

<p>Hino says that Inafune, who was serving as a producer on the project, left Level-5 "in mid-2024", causing the studio to "reassess and restructure the project". Inafune's departure, together with "harsh evaluations" from early playtesters, led Level-5 to undertake a "complete overhaul" of <em>Fantasy Life i</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-level-5-keiji-inafune.jpg?itok=i6piakSi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-level-5-keiji-inafune.jpg?itok=8RkYIEvJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>suffered a setback last year when producer Keiji Inafune left Level-5.</figcaption></figure><p>Hino goes on to say that the additions prompted by Inafune's departure and the feedback, including "parkour-style actions" and "open-world exploration", caused testers to give the game "high praise", reminding Hino and the team of the "true joy in creating a large-scale game".</p>

<p>If you need a refresher, Keiji Inafune worked with Capcom from the late 80s through to 2010, helping to create enduring franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Onimusha</em>, among others.</p>

<p>He left Capcom in 2010 and created Comcept, the studio that would go on to release the much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Mighty No. 9</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Soul Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>ReCore</em>.</p>

<p>Comcept was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-acquires-keiji-inafunes-comcept" rel="nofollow">acquired by Level-5 in 2017</a>, providing development assistance on Level-5 games like&nbsp;<em>Megaton Musashi</em>&nbsp;as well as spearheading the development of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>.</p>




<p>It's not clear what Inafune will do next; he hasn't made any kind of official announcement regarding his departure. He could, however, take the route <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios" rel="nofollow">followed</a> by some of his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bloodborne-and-final-fantasy-16-designer-velux" rel="nofollow">colleagues</a> and start up his own studio, perhaps with backing from a company like NetEase (although that may be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">becoming more difficult</a>).</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is set for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013482" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on May 21st.</p>

That all changed over the weekend as concept art for <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>has reportedly leaked, illustrating some of the franchise’s disparate heroes finally coming together. It may also give us hints about the film’s story, which seems to be a deviation from the typical cataclysmic MCU crossover. If you want to see the art and speculation about what it all means, read on.</p><p>The concept art was originally posted on ArtStation by user noirmutaon and has since been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://noirmutaon.artstation.com/projects/lGN6A5?album_id=1347230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://noirmutaon.artstation.com/projects/lGN6A5?album_id=1347230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted from the art hosting site</a></span>. The account belongs to Mushk Rizvi, a senior concept artist at Marvel Studios. Though the post has been scrapped from the site, fans have already spread the art and begun dissecting what it tells us about <em>Doomsday</em>. Let’s go piece by piece and break it down.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-recommend-id="image://5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1164" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-recommend-id="image://5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1164" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of the art feels incomprehensible right now because it features characters we’ve not seen interact at all. One includes Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord, having returned to Earth after the end of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3</em>, hanging out on the couch with White Vision, who has been absent from the MCU since his “creation” at the end of <em>WandaVision</em>. White Vision, having come to an understanding with the original Vision, flew away from all the chaos of Westview and we haven’t seen him since. Apparently, at some phase of <em>Doomsday</em>’s development at least, he and Star-Lord were quite chummy and watching TV with beers and pizza. Until Marvel says otherwise, I’m choosing to believe they’re boyfriends. Star-Lord is bisexual in the comics, so fuck it. They’re boyfriends cuddling on the couch.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-recommend-id="image://7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1560" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-recommend-id="image://7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1560" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jokes aside, Star-Lord does seem to be playing a significant role in the movie, as shown in the art of him and sorcerer Wong chatting with members of what fans believe to be the Young Avengers. Members include Wiccan, Stature, Hawkeye, what appears to be Speed, and Ms. Marvel being her usual fangirling self. It looks like Star-Lord and Wong are mentoring the kids in some way, probably briefing them on a mission. Fans have noted that the roster is missing a few key members who were expected to be part of the group based on previous MCU appearances, including Eli Bradley, who appeared in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> and is typically known as Patriot in the comics, and America Chavez, who had a major role in <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>. Just because they’re not in the concept art doesn’t mean they won’t show up in the final film, but fans seem to be divided on the Young Avengers line-up based on this image. I’m happy to see what looks like a reunion for Wiccan and Speed, though.

Doom is notably not the main villain in the upcoming <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, so it’s unclear if we’ll get much of a sense of the relationship between these two before <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>premieres in 2026. It’s also unclear if this art is depicting the beginning of a new conflict between them or if it’s building off of something we’ll see unfold in <em>First Steps</em>. (Doom is confirmed to appear in the film in a post-credits scene.)</p><p>Another wrinkle in all of this is that it appears Doctor Strange and possibly Yelena are working for Doctor Strange in this odd reality. It looks like Doom’s presence may do a lot more than just yank us backwards in time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-recommend-id="image://191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-recommend-id="image://191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Most of this concept art is easy to wrap your head around, but one piece is raising eyebrows because of its implications for the larger MCU. It depicts what, at a glance, looks like another version of T’Challa, the Black Panther who was originally played by the late Chadwick Boseman. <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> acknowledged the actor’s death by having the hero die of an illness and passing the moniker to his sister, Shuri. It would be strange for Marvel to have made such a show of writing around Boseman’s death just to bring him back with a different actor four years later, but this art might not be of T’Challa at all. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j0zrx1/comment/mffmx89/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j0zrx1/comment/mffmx89/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan points out</a></span>, the url associated with this piece specifically mentions T’Chanda, the grandfather of T’Challa and Shuri. That man is long gone by the time of <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, though, so it’s unclear how this might be implemented into the film, if at all. Some fans have noted that the concept art looks like it might be based on <em>Snowfall </em>actor Damson Idris, so he might be joining the MCU in some fashion in the near future.</p><hr><p>Because the MCU has been pivoting into this movie rather than leading up to it for years like it did with the last <em>Avengers</em> crossover, we still don’t know much about <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> in the grand scheme of things. Doctor Doom is an enigma to us, so we can’t be sure of his motivations in the movies yet. But if this concept art is at all indicative of what the final movie will look like, it’s going to at least be an interesting spin on the MCU, one the franchise arguably needs right now. <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>is set to premiere on May 1, 2026.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This follow-up has been delayed several times. It originally had a 2023 release window, but now won't be coming out until May 21 of this year. Level-5 CEO Akihirio Hiro has now publicly discussed the development difficulties Fantasy Life i has encountered.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alqHzDtQvhE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/alqHzDtQvhE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He revealed that producer Keiji Inafune left Level-5 last summer amid "harsh" feedback from internal playtests. Inafune is well-known for his storied history working on franchises like Mega Man at Capcom and spearheading the now-infamous Kickstarter game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mighty-no-9/" data-ref-id="5000-193714">Mighty No. 9</a>. Level-5 <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/yo-kai-watch-dev-level-5-acquires-keiji-inafunes-comcept" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acquired Comcept</a>, Inafune's company, around a year after the critically bashed release of Mighty No. 9. Inafune has served on a producer of several Level-5 projects since then, including Fantasy Life i.</p><p>Inafune's departure and poor playtest feedback allowed Hiro to accept that "major revisions were necessary" to improve Fantasy Life i. Hiro explains that development on the project shifted to include Level-5 studios from all across Japan, not just the Osaka studio that was initially working on the game. The addition of features like open-world exploration, parkour, cross-play, and cross-save to Fantasy Life i followed, according to Hiro. The UI, story, and progression systems of the game have also been refined.</p><p>Now, Level-5 believes that it "enhanced what was already great about the game, making the experience significantly more enjoyable" and has gotten more positive feedback from internal testing. As a result, Hiro confirmed that Fantasy Life i is now in "its final stage of development" and should make that May release date. Level-5 will slightly delay the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/" data-ref-id="5000-463484">Inazuma Eleven Victory Road</a> due to the "ripple effects" of what has gone on with Fantasy Life i, but will reveal its release date during a livestream on April 11.</p><p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will be released for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 21.</p>

<section><p>Sandfall Interactive's upcoming title is one of the most exciting JRPGs in years, and it's being made in France</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">Games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 don't get made anymore. And that's because games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <em>can't</em> be made anymore. French developer Sandfall Interactive's influences were obvious to me from the moment I began playing the game, and confirmed when director Guillaume Broche and producer François Meurisse effusively recounted the joys of playing Final Fantasy, Persona, Zelda, and many other Japanese titles.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of gameplay, Expedition 33 looks to be moving in the right direction; drawing from its clear inspirations while also adding interesting twists and new takes. But many other games have done this--in this respect, Expedition 33 isn't notably unique or rare. What does, however, differentiate this game from its contemporaries is how it evokes the vibe of a transitional period of time when JRPGs and its flag bearers struggled to find their place on a new generation of consoles.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preview: Style and Substance</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While Sandfall Interactive often looks to Final Fantasy as a point of comparison, for me, it is much closer to the games Hironobu Sakaguchi made in the nascent years of the Xbox 360, back when Microsoft was courting Japanese developers and gamers in hopes of expanding its presence in the region.</p><p dir="ltr">After leaving Square Enix, where he created Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi founded Mistwalker. The studio's most notable releases were Xbox 360-exclusives Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon. At the time, it was an exciting prospect: the father of Final Fantasy making new IPs that, to many, looked like the rebirth of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. With the spiritual successors of two of the most beloved franchises in Japan being exclusive to Xbox, Microsoft was sure to finally crack that Japanese nut.</p><p dir="ltr">Both games garnered some popularity and helped move the needle ever so slightly, but it wasn't meaningful enough to significantly improve Xbox's position. Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon aren't remembered as the instigators of a tide shift for Xbox in Japan. However, for me, the games and their legacies are fascinating as snapshots of a time when JRPGs got a little insecure.</p><p dir="ltr">With Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, Mistwalker pushed the genre from its adolescence--where it was carefully nurtured by Japanese developers in safe, controlled environments--out into the chaos of a changing video game landscape. It was the genre's awkward teenage years where it let go of what it used to be to figure out what it wanted to be, at a time when it was being told what it needed to be. The resulting identity of the games undergoing this journey is so unique to its time and context that you just had to be there to see and feel what that was like.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like JRPGs from the 2000s, developer Sandfall Interactive is also trying to find its place in the world while trying to reconcile multiple identities with its first game. The concept of Expedition 33 is born of an intense love of Japanese games, but the small team behind it is based in France. After playing it for a few hours, Expedition 33 feels like it could end up being exactly what I hoped would emerge from the period of uncertainty, challenge, and risk-taking Mistwalker's games faced: who or what I remembered, but self-assured in what it wants to be, and proud of its changes.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat was the focal point of the three-hour demo I played, and as the core driver of gameplay it was an insightful illustration of how Sandfall Interactive is interpreting its inspirations and building upon them. Expedition 33's combat feels like how I remember playing Mistwalker's games: a combination of the classic turn-based RPG gameplay that captured me in my formative gaming years and <em>just a little more </em>layered on top. Back when I played Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, this combination resulted in some awkwardness, but Sandfall's ideas feel like they have been executed more confidently.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio calls its gameplay style "reactive turn-based combat," and this is a very apt way to describe it. It takes the basics of any classic JRPG--attack, cast magic, use item, flee--and removes almost all the parts where you're <em>only</em> watching it happen. The basic attack and item use are the only press-and-watch commands I found, while everything else required me to engage one, two, and even three further times to maximize their impact--that's the "reactive" part. All magic and abilities are quick-time events that made sure I remained engaged and focused so that I could do more damage or recover more health.</p><p dir="ltr">Gustave functioned as my all-around damage dealer; my Cloud, Squall, Zidane, or Tidus. His abilities were oriented around increasing damage for himself and others. "Mark" allowed me to paint a target with a crosshair so the next attack would deal 50 percent more damage. However, the actual execution also involved hitting a button with very specific timing indicated by an on-screen bar--think of it as a QTE version of Squall's slash and gunshot combo from Final Fantasy 8.</p><p dir="ltr">Lune, meanwhile, was more akin to a mage, with elemental spells that could exploit weaknesses and be bolstered with the same timing-based button press. The twist on her gameplay involved the elements interacting with each other. Using combinations of elements can change their damage values, but it's a multi-stage process where you "paint" an enemy with Stains of an element and then follow-up with another to consume it and activate the effect. There is a little diagram on screen that keeps track of which elements an enemy has been painted with so players can plan their approaches.</p><p dir="ltr">Maelle is difficult to categorize since she is a secondary damage dealer like Barret, Zell, or Auron might be, but with an interesting mechanical twist. The majority of her abilities involve running up to enemies and slashing them, with a successful QTE increasing damage. However, the added wrinkle is that she has a stance system tied to these various attacks. By using an ability, I was able to go from an un-stanced state into an offense-oriented one that would increase my damage but also make me take more damage as a trade-off. From there, I could use abilities to transition into defensive stances, or others that have their own risk versus reward trade-offs that had important strategic considerations.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">Although Sekiro was the inspiration, the QTE and parry system as a whole, when used together, feels more like a rhythm game</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">When the flow of battle switches to defense, with the enemies attacking, there's also always opportunities to affect the battle to your advantage. This is where, surprisingly, Sandfall looked to From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice to bring a similar parry system to Expedition 33's combat. The vast majority of enemy attacks have specific timing windows during which, if the parry button is pressed, damage is completely nullified. The window is very tight, but even those who aren't able to react quickly naturally can build muscle memory through repetition and familiarity with the enemy's attack animations. Many attacks have multiple hits, often with staggered timing between them and this is where the extra challenge lies. However, when I was able to parry every part of a multi-stage attack I was able to escape without taking damage and, better still, riposte with my own attack to turn the tables. The final piece of the defensive puzzle is jumping-specific attacks that are telegraphed and can only be avoided by launching into the air. While airborne, a pull of the trigger will execute a mid-air counterattack--think of it as the game's Mikiri Counter; another Sekiro reference point.</p><p dir="ltr">Properly executing parries is incredibly satisfying, with crunchy sound effects and flashy visual effects synchronizing with each successful parry, further rewarded with an over-the-top counterattack. Although Sekiro was the inspiration, the QTE and parry system as a whole, when used together, feels more like a rhythm game. The mixture of inputs at specific timing and the feedback received tickled the same part of my brain that is activated by games like Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, Taiko no Tatsujin, or even Beat Saber.</p><p dir="ltr">A safer defensive option, however, is the dodge. Hit a button as an enemy is attacking and the party member under siege hops backward to get out of the way, and can do so multiple times too. There is a standard dodge, which has a pretty generous timing window, and a perfect dodge, which is done at the very last split-second, it's timing matching that of the parry. With the right loadout, doing this can be rewarded with the AP points spent on actions.</p><p dir="ltr">For those that want or need it, lowering the difficulty option makes the timing windows for the follow-up inputs more generous and there's an accessibility option that will auto-complete all your offensive commands. Dodge and parries, however, are not automatically executed using this setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the Final Fantasy 10-like tracker of attack order, there was a wonderful synergy between defense and offense that leveraged timing-based inputs to make every interaction feel rewarding and useful. It also builds a palpable sense of momentum that can sometimes translate to a complete party wipe where no damage is inflicted on any of my crew. With all the metaphorical wheels turning, gears clicking, and pistons firing, the battles have the same thrilling energy as Persona 5 and its baton pass system. Expedition 33's combat is made of familiar mechanics, but they're synergized and layered on top of a classic system that really executes on the foundational decision of doing turn-based combat, but elevating it just a little more. At the risk of overselling it, when I reached a flow state, it had that intoxicating effect that had me seeking out more opportunities to fight enemies. And that is a good sign.</p><p dir="ltr">As a permanently From Software-pilled person, I am prone to looking at things through a Soulslike lens. That, it turns out, also goes for Sandfall and its approach to enemies. While the standard grunts can eventually be trivialized (provided you're on point with timing), the bosses are far more formidable--I died a whole bunch of times to a few of them and even opted to avoid one or two optional ones for fear of getting into a spiral of grudge matches. Difficulty isn't the only ingredient taken from the Souls games, as the team has also tried to make sure each boss is memorable both visually and mechanically. I fought nightmarish eldritch creatures that spat ink at me; a vicious French Mime that repeatedly kicked my ass until I decided to come back later for him; rotund sea-dwelling creatures that draw power from flowers; and many other weird monstrosities.</p><p dir="ltr">Each boss was a little puzzle that could be solved with the offensive and defensive tools at my disposal, but a few presented unexpected challenges. The ink-spitting giant, for example, was a bit of a tank but after a little experimentation I found a very effective combo of marking it, shocking it with lightning, and casting a defensive barrier to nullify any attacks I wasn't able to parry or dodge. I had it all worked out until it reached down and ate one of my party members, removing them; their tools; and their involvement in my strategy. This happened a second time until just Lune was left. With all items depleted, a sliver of health left, and not enough AP to really dent its lifebar, I turned on my Sekiro brain and decided to just focus on parrying to use the counterattack for big damage. Against all odds, I emerged victorious and I can't describe the elation I felt having locked in and avoided all damage from a barrage of attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, tough bosses are a pillar of the JRPG experience--you can look to Final Fantasy's Emerald Weapon, Omega Weapon, Penance, and the like for that. Expedition 33 builds on that pillar with a greater focus on boss phases that switch up the flow of battle. It's boss fights, but just a little more.</p><p dir="ltr">In my discussions with Expedition 33's devs, one thing was mentioned repeatedly as the holy grail of JRPGs for the team that, sadly, has fallen out of favor: the world map. There's a big difference between an overworld that connects areas in modern open-world games and the classic world maps of JRPGs. Expedition 33 firmly aligns with the latter style, using an isometric viewpoint of a miniaturized world that a tiny version of your characters runs around in to travel to new areas or discover hidden ones. You can even set up camp and chat with party members, listen to music, or reflect on events. It's not quite as charming as summoning a Moogle that is somehow able to sprint over mountains to come and save the game for you, but it injects the same sense of a grand adventure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451614-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451614" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451614-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451614"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451614-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451615-ss_9e050e6a61a4d9f4fe54bc62c8c73da38e9a63b0.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451616-ss_483a27df5072beb3a4650634a764bda750fbcb82.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451617-ss_0902af724ac45a9093dee022a7893dc50cbf555e.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451618-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451619-ss_e49800e906e8a0f00707458c836567c933603bac.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451615,1300-4451616,1300-4451617,1300-4451618,1300-4451619" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451615-ss_9e050e6a61a4d9f4fe54bc62c8c73da38e9a63b0.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451616-ss_483a27df5072beb3a4650634a764bda750fbcb82.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451617-ss_0902af724ac45a9093dee022a7893dc50cbf555e.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451618-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451619-ss_e49800e906e8a0f00707458c836567c933603bac.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451615-ss_9e050e6a61a4d9f4fe54bc62c8c73da38e9a63b0.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451616-ss_483a27df5072beb3a4650634a764bda750fbcb82.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451617-ss_0902af724ac45a9093dee022a7893dc50cbf555e.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451618-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451619-ss_e49800e906e8a0f00707458c836567c933603bac.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's so much more to Expedition 33 beyond its gameplay mechanics. It has a simple premise and great hook: a figure called the Paintress appears at certain points in the world of Lumiere and writes a number on a distant monolithic structure. This starts a countdown that, when it runs out, makes everyone of the age of the initial number cease to exist. As Expedition 33, you're tasked with finally stopping the Paintress and the cycle of death. Early in the journey, however, you encounter a mysterious antagonist that has aged, meaning he has somehow escaped certain doom to live a long life. There's a fascinating Belle Époque France meets post-apocalyptic world to discover, characters to meet; Nier Automata-inspired music to listen to, and more. Every part of Expedition 33 feels familiar, but they all come together to create an experience that feels fresh at the same time, kind of like how Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon once felt.</p><p dir="ltr">While borrowing design ideas and reinterpreting gameplay mechanics is something many are capable of doing successfully, being able to capture the vibe of a game that existed at a certain place and time is so unlikely that it verges on impossible. And yet, Expedition 33 looks to be doing that. But the game it could be isn't one trying to find itself; it's one that wants to show you what its genre has become. And that's potential worth keeping an eye on.</p>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya is still interested in developing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a>, after the PlatinumGames and Microsoft action game was cancelled back in 2017.</p>
<p>Kamiya has now founded a new studio, Clovers, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">developing a sequel to Okami</a>. A new post on the Clovers account includes a video showing "some excitement around Kamiya's desk".</p>
<p>"He was reminiscing about the development of Scalebound while watching YouTube videos," reads the post. "It never made it to release, but even now, he still feels proud of it."</p>

<p>Kamiya is quoted as saying: "I'd love to make it again someday.😊"</p>
<p>He also shared the video on his own social media account, adding: "Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>Scalebound was planned to be an action game with a human protagonist in a fantasy world, with a sidekick dragon.</p>
<p>"He's got his own headphones and smartphone," Kamiya says in the video.</p>
<p>"Just like an isekai reincarnation," a developer responds, referring to the trend in Japanese anime for stories about characters being transported to other worlds (think Spirited Away).</p>
<p>"Yeah, exactly! That's the big trend right now," replies Kamiya.</p> <div>

<p>After more than four years of development, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Xbox One exclusive game was cancelled</a> and Microsoft and PlatinumGames parted ways on the project.</p>
<p>That's not the last we've heard of the game, though. In 2021 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Kamiya publicly apologised to Microsoft for Scalebound's cancellation</a>, after discussing the development challenges and admitting: "We weren't experienced enough."</p>
<p>Then in 2022, Platinum president Atsushi Inaba revealed in an interview with IGN <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-would-love-to-resurrect-scalebound-and-wants-to-discuss-it-with-microsoft-properly">Kamiya had been "talking about wanting to work on Scalebound again for a while"</a>. Kamiya himself added: "I'd like to appeal to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> directly! Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>It seems Kamiya is once again trying that tactic to appeal to Xbox boss Phil Spencer. Will it work this time? Is Kamiya now free to resurrect Scalebound with Clovers?</p>
<p>Or maybe he's just jealous that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, with the backing of Spencer. Can Phil work his magic this time?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-irish-language-program-from-the-90s-is-my-new-favorite-tv-show.1123887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The journey that got me here isn’t important, but I’ve signed up for an introductory Irish language class that starts in a week. Because I’m an overachieving nerd, I decided to start digging around the language in advance, which has trapped me in a horrifying maze of words that aren’t spelled at all like they sound. But on the plus side, it has also led me to <em>Now You’re Talking</em>, an early 90s language learning series that I’m completely in love with.</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03znk3q/clips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Now You’re Talking</em></a> was apparently a BBC series tied to a now out-of-print language book. It is, in the nature of all beginner language scenarios, wonderfully surreal. In the first episode, adults walk up to playing children and chilling teens to demand to know how they’re doing; young people lurk around bus stops and bike racks to comment forcefully on the weather. The second episode features a scenario where a couple making out on a couch is constantly interrupted by the girl’s family as an excuse to say the words “brother,” “sister,” and “mother.” The show is narrated by a woman who has to have something to do while she’s explaining language to us, so in the second episode she’s randomly at the gym, walking on a treadmill and telling the viewer about how you ask for someone’s name. Because it’s the early 90s, everyone is in chunky sweaters and windbreakers.</p><figure><figcaption>A video game reference makes this a video game blog I guess</figcaption></figure><p>But my favorite regular <em>Now You’re Talking </em>segment is the story of Sean and Deirdre, two people who meet in the show’s town of An Baile Mór. In the first episode, Deirdre’s horoscope tells her “today the cavalry rides in” and that she’s in for some luck. That luck comes in the form of reaching for the same door as Sean, a man with a delightfully 80s haircut and outfit. They try to use the same payphone (<em>a payphone!)</em>; given his/our limited language skills at this point, Sean can’t make very much conversation, so he playfully takes her bag and then gives it back to her after her call. Then, because they can’t say much else, after she thanks him for giving back the bag he basically stole in some kind of wordless neg, she starts to walk away, and he can only call after her that it’s a nice day out even though they’re inside (Tá lá breá ann). She looks him up and down before agreeing it is (Tá) and then, desperate to say whatever the viewer will understand, he calls out what I <em>think</em> is him saying that it’s hot (Tá sé te), which is very confusing given that Deirdre is wearing a scarf, and she replies with immense flirtatiousness that it certainly is. The whole thing is wildly pregnant with subtext, but not <em>too </em>much, and it makes the whole interaction incredibly trippy.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Now You're Talking - Episode 1" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nz--LpYC30?start=1152&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the second episode they meet again, when Deirdre is celebrating her parents’ anniversary and he’s the waiter at their restaurant (reader, I gasped!). Since the second episode is about how to introduce yourself and others, Sean says his name and then everyone stares at each other meaningfully until he walks away, because Deirdre doesn’t have the words to explain how they met. Later, Deirdre introduces her family, which feels like something you’d reserve for someone you’re actually dating and not a guy you talked about the weather with at a payphone. Sean makes small talk with her little brother about his identity, asking “And who’s this?" (Agus cé seo?) and “what’s your name?” (C’ainm atá ort?) the way you would for a kid who I feel like would be much younger than her brother seems to be. (Her brother, it should be noted, appears to be wearing a baseball cap with a radio and headphones fitted in, complete with an antenna.) Deirdre’s dad threateningly informs Sean that Deirdre is his daughter (I’ll be honest here, I have no idea how to spell what he’s saying, but I did understand it!), which causes him to gulp and ask for their order.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Now You're Talking - Episode 2" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-WjR1XVOrU?start=1239&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When the family leaves the restaurant after the meal, they can’t talk about what occurred in any detail because we don’t know any of those words yet, so they grin and say their goodbyes and remind each other how they’re related. Also, there’s some kind of weird lineup across the street that makes it look like the whole town is watching the interaction. <em>But then</em> Deirdre passes back by the restaurant and Sean bluntly suggests coffee (a word we haven’t learned, but which is easy to sound out), to which she eagerly agrees (Cinntae).&nbsp;</p><p>I am on the absolute edge of my seat here. <em>Now You’re Talking</em>’s narrator says the third episode will involve learning about how to say where you live and how to give your phone number, which I hope bodes well for what will surely be an incredibly awkward date given Sean and Deirdre’s limited language skills. Obviously <em>Now You’re Talking</em> isn’t the first show to employ an ongoing narrative to help teach viewers language, but it’s such a good move to get me invested, and the structure of an ongoing meetcute is such a good way to slowly introduce new language concepts.</p><p>Apparently there are multiple different dialects in Irish; <em>Now You’re Talking</em> uses the Ulster dialect, but I don’t know which one my class will be in, so there’s a good chance I’m setting myself up to be a version of the assholes who filled the Japanese class I ferociously failed in grad school 20 years ago, where kids far younger than me confidently asserted incorrect things they’d learned from anime while I could barely spell on my own name. Each roughly 20-minute <em>Now You’re Talking</em> episode I’ve watched so far has taken me hours to get through because I keep pausing to try to understand why the <a href="https://www.acleversheep.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuaimeanna-agus-litriu-202011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spelling</a> sounds the way it does, which I doubt a handful of conversational short classes at a local community center will focus on. I wouldn’t say that it’s taught me Irish yet, but this morning I walked around my apartment muttering “Tá sé fuar” (It’s cold) to myself, which is technically speaking a foreign language! I’m so excited to learn more, and <em>so</em> excited to find out what will happen to Sean and Deirdre next.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite having been released over four years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the best-looking open-world games ever released, and the latest version of the DreamPunk mod makes the game almost feel like a next-generation game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new version of the mod</a> introduces new features and improvements over its previous version, such as Dynamic Contrast and Realistic Cloud Lighting, improved weather conditions to make them look as realistic as possible, remade core LUT to allow for a higher dynamic range and more realistic sunlight and more. The new version of the mod also introduces some graphics configuration improvements to better fit NVIDIA DLSS 4 and the improved capabilities of the recently released RTX 5000 series. The end results are incredible, as showcased in the 8K resolution video below provided by NextGen Dreams.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 on RTX 5090 with New DreamPunk 3.0 Graphics - Ultra Realistic Modded Showcase in 8K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etXFdqPu1Wk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was among the<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-4/"> first games</a> to support the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a>. The new version of the upscaler, whose release coincided with the launch of the RTX 5090 GPU back in late January, introduces plenty of improvements over the previous version, including a new Transformer model that brings significant image quality improvements. DLSS 4 also comes with an RTX 5000 series exclusive feature, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, which brings significant performance improvements in supported titles.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about how the game was changed with the 2.0 patch and the Phantom Liberty expansion by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-mode-sumo-independent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Sumo Group publisher Secret Mode has announced that it will split from the group and go independent, having secured the backing of investment firm Emona Capital.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/secret-mode-splits-from-sumo-to-become-independent-publisher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, Secret Mode execs James Schall and Ed Blincoe led the buyout alongside Emona, and the goal is to focus on discovering and publishing indie games for PC and console without the backing of former owner Sumo Group.</p>

<p>Although the publisher technically has significant investment from Emona, it will remain entirely independent from a business perspective, with Schall and Blincoe continuing to lead the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-little-to-the-left-secret-mode.jpg?itok=5GLJBmVH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-little-to-the-left-secret-mode.jpg?itok=HOJ8iom7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Little to the Left&nbsp;</em>is just one of Secret Mode's publishing endeavors.</figcaption></figure><p>Schall says that becoming independent will allow Secret Mode to put "all [its] efforts into uncovering the indie gems that gamers never knew they needed in their lives".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the studio is "committed to bringing [its] players the very best indie titles", but not just the ones being released in the future; Schall also says the mission is to help people "discover existing indie masterpieces that have undeservedly flown under the radar".</p>

<p>This news comes after Sumo Group, Secret Mode's former owner, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">announced it would lay off a number of staff</a> and refocus on support and work-for-hire projects rather than developing its own IP.</p>

<p>That move doesn't affect anything Sumo Digital, which is the development wing of Sumo Group, already has in the pipeline, so you can rest easy; there shouldn't be any more delays to&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>as a result of this shakeup.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sumo-group.jpg?itok=zuvLfQwE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sumo-group.jpg?itok=x68r_sPu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Work on&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>should be unaffected by Sumo Group's layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>As Game Developer points out, Secret Mode isn't Emona's first gaming industry investment; the company has also invested in the likes of&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes&nbsp;</em>developer Relic Entertainment, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">also went independent last year</a>&nbsp;(a decision which preceded Relic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">own round of layoffs</a>, sadly).</p>

<p>As for Secret Mode itself, it's not entirely clear what's next for the publisher, although Schall says that he and the studio "hope to make some exciting announcements" regarding their future plans "in the coming months".</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar Games have announced the acquisition of Video Games Deluxe, the Sydney-based team who collaborated with them on the 2017 re-release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">L.A. Noire</a>, virtual reality spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire-the-vr-case-files">L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files</a> and, most recently, post-launch updates for Grove Street's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>. The studio will now be known as (drum roll please) Rockstar Australia.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Video Game Deluxe were founded by Brendan McNamara in 2013. You might remember McNamara as the founder of original L.A. Noire developer, Team Bondi. Team Bondi had an outsized reputation for long hours, tyrannical management and high turnover, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-team-bondi-part-ways">as explored in an IGN report from 2011</a> based on anonymous developer interviews, which led to an investigation from the International Game Developers Association. The studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/la-noire-developers-team-bondi-in-administration">went into administration later that year</a>, after Rockstar announced they would not publish their next title.
</p>
<p>
McNamara and other former L.A. Noire developers subsequently got together to make a spiritual successor, Whore Of The Orient, at new studio KMM Interactive Entertainment, but the project and studio were eventually shuttered after publishing partner Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment pulled funding.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any reporting about what it's like to work at Video Game Deluxe, who have done good work over the years. They're the outfit credited with "saving" Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, a technical disaster of such magnitude that Rockstar felt moved to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-can-claim-another-rockstar-game-for-free-right-now">hand out free games as compensation</a>.</p>
<p>
It's likely that the newly rebranded Rockstar Australia will be pitching in with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> development - Rockstar's latest is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">due for release on console</a> later this year, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">a PC release date forthcoming</a>. "It's been an honour to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade," McNamara said <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/rockstar-games-acquire-video-games-deluxe">in a statement regarding today's announcement</a>. "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."

It’s because of one cutscene in the game that revolves around the cooking and eating of cheese naan. It shows it in great detail, complete with steaming hot melted cheese, as the player character and their companions sit down for a meal in Kunafa Village.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you progress through the story in the Windward Plains, your hunter will be invited to a meal in the village of Kunafa, where those who live in the desert reside. These villagers who know nothing of hunting and haven't even seen weapons before treat you to a dish that resembles a freshly baked cheese naan. As you bite into its crispy surface with charred spots, both steam and melted cheese come pouring out. The meal is an unbelievable feast for a hunter from the outside world, making it a scene that shows just how much you're welcomed by these villagers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Automaton translated a number of social media posts from fans who were so inspired by the Monster Hunter Wilds cutscene that they sought out cheese naan in real life. A Nepalese restaurant in Tokyo called Salam Namaste also got in on the fun, tweeting: “Salam Namaste when we get 99 cheese naan orders at midnight.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">深夜にチーズナン99個注文が入った時のサラムナマステ<br> <a href="https://t.co/WA7E2pYlNP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WA7E2pYlNP</a></p>— サラムナマステ Salam Namaste Tokyo सलाम नमस्ते👂🥘🌕🍗🥃 (@salamnamaste01) <a href="https://twitter.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896048091155054753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“The cheese naan is too popular,” <a href="https://x.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896188428393537908" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the restaurant added</a>. “Even though I had a lot of cheese, I started to run out so I had to go to the supermarket to buy more.

When we thought about how they get animal-based nutrients, we decided that they must raise livestock and eat dairy-based foods. You're able to get a grain similar to wheat when you go out to a more wide-open part of the map, right? So maybe they make something like naan using that grain. On top of that, we wanted it to be something made from simple ingredients, and not too complicated. We thought that a dish like cheese naan would be simple yet possible to depict in a delicious way, and so we put a good amount of effort into that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while it may appear to be a casual dining scene, it seems that a lot of labor went into showing this dish similar to one that exists in real life, cheese naan, in a delicious and meaningful way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's actually incredibly difficult to depict something that's crispy on the surface but springy on the inside using CG,” added Fujioka. “We'd been making attempts at the food scene in Kunafa from early on in development, even at the prototype stage, and we just couldn't get it to look the way we wanted. Still, the Wilds development team is incredibly talented, and I was shocked to see them ultimately reach the way it looks in the released version after a lot of trial and error.

I'll keep everything updated, safe, and online for 32 days longer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason Phantom Overlay is committed to staying online for 32 days is to ensure people with a 30-day key "get their full money's worth."
