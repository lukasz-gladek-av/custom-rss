			<p>If you've been getting stuck into the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> latest game</a> from MachineGames, you'll know that you're stepping into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">role of Indiana Jones</a>. In this game, you'll get to hunt for relics, solve puzzles, and, of course, fight off many villains. If you've been doing your exploring correctly, you will have come across some Skill Books in the game. Don't panic if you don't know what they're for just yet, as this guide will explain everything you need to know about the Skill Books and how to use them in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<h2>How To Use Skill Books in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As you're adventuring as Indiana Jones, you'll be able to obtain Adventure Books. You can also call them Skill Books, as that is technically what they are. They provide new skills or buffs to your pre-existing skills, which can help you survive in the vast world you'll explore, as well as help you with combat and brawling. Picking up the book doesn't automatically mean that you've learned a new skill, though. By cycling to the Books tab in your main menu, you'll find a list of all of the books you've found under their relevant categories.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the books that are available in that category. If you hover over the book that interests you, it will tell you what you need to be able to use the book and learn the skill. To learn a skill, you need <strong>Adventure Points</strong>. Adventure Points are earned by finding secrets during your exploration, by collecting hidden items such as posters and letters, and even by taking pictures using your camera. There are plenty of things hidden in the world of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, making it easy for you to tally up Adventure Points fast enough, as long as you're thorough with your exploration and look in every nook and cranny you come across.</p>
<p>Once you have the required amount of Adventure Points, you'll then be able to learn the skill by reading the book, and the skill will be activated, allowing you to use it when you need to.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about how to use skill books in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Good luck exploring!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is out now and free to play on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. The hero shooter pretty shamelessly draws inspiration from <em>Overwatch</em>. As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae that are different and worth keeping in mind, even if you’ve spent hundreds of hours in similar games. I put about 15 hours into <em>Marvel Rivals</em> during its test periods and about a few additional hours since its launch on December 5. So here are a few tips for newcomers if you’re jumping into the game for the first time.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196880" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h92977"><a id=""></a><strong>Spend some time in the practice range</strong></h2><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>launched <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">with a sizable roster</a></span>. With 33 characters right off the bat, it can be overwhelming to find which heroes you jive with. <em>Rivals </em>matches are so fast-paced that deciphering what each character does can be confusing, as well. Your best bet in finding a hero you gravitate toward is to spend some time in the practice range first. Here you’ll have full access to the whole roster and can train on some robot dummies. Just a few minutes in here will give you a starting point before heading into online matches. This way you’re not completely fumbling in the dark without any frame of reference for how characters play. The best way to learn all the intricacies is by playing a real battle, of course, but going in blind will make that on-ramp more difficult.</p><h2 id="h92978"><a id=""></a><strong>Actually read your Hero Profile</strong></h2><p>Part of getting to know all the heroes is learning their moveset, but several of them have passive abilities you’ll never actually press a button to activate but are still worth knowing. In the hero select screen you can access each character’s Hero Profile, which contains a straightforward rundown of all their abilities, active and passive. Read these before you actually run out into a fight if you’re trying someone new, it’ll be the difference between winging it and having some tactics in mind for how to handle a fight.</p><h2 id="h92979"><a id=""></a><strong>Here’s a rundown of the currencies</strong></h2><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is free-to-play, and that means it makes most of its money by way of microtransactions. None of the heroes are locked behind a paywall, but cosmetics like costumes, emotes, and highlight intros cost currency. There are two primary currencies that hold essentially the same value, The gold one is called Lattice, which can be bought with real money, and the blue one is called a Unit, which can be earned by playing and completing challenges. Lattice can be exchanged 1:1 for Units, with $1 USD equating to 100 Lattice. You can only purchase Lattice in bundles, meaning you might have to overshoot to pay for something cheaper. I bought the Star-Lord <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>costume, which cost 1800 Units, but the only bundle that would cover the cost was the $20 Lattice bundle. So just keep that in mind as you navigate buying in-game currency. Beyond those, there are also Chrono Tokens used specifically to unlock battle pass rewards that you’ll gain through events and tasks.</p><h2 id="h92980"><a id=""></a><strong>The battle pass is not time-gated</strong></h2><p>Speaking of battle passes, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is taking the FOMO out of its Luxury Battle Passes by allowing you to unlock their contents at any point as long as you purchase them during the season. The pass itself costs 490 Lattices and contains costumes and other cosmetic items. So if you plan on playing <em>Marvel Rivals </em>long-term and want to unlock everything in the battle pass but might have to take a break every now and then, you can just buy the battle pass and come back to it whenever you feel like it.</p><h2 id="h92981"><a id=""></a><strong>Here’s a free Iron Man skin</strong></h2><p>If you’re reading this before March 5, 2025, NetEase is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864824576175128653&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864824576175128653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giving out a free Iron Man skin</a></span>. Redeem the code nwarh4k3xqy in-game and deck out Tony Stark in the black-and-gold Armor Model 42.</p><h2 id="h92982"><a id=""></a><strong>Team-ups can give you an edge, but don’t feel pressured to pick heroes solely for them</strong></h2><p>One of the big distinguishing features of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is Team-Up abilities. These give certain heroe combinations an extra ability that can give you an advantage in a fight. Some are an extra ability in your back pocket like Adam Warlock giving Mantis and Star-Lord a second life, while others like Rocket and Jeff riding on Groot’s back and losing their independent movement in exchange for increased defense will fundamentally change how you play in some ways. These are great when they come up naturally and building your team composition around them is a good tactic. However, they are not the end-all-be-all of strategy in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Plenty of matches can be won without characters who are artificially meant to work better together. It’s all about reading the situation you’re in and sticking with characters you can play well enough to defeat the enemy team.</p><h2 id="h92983"><a id=""></a><strong>Be flexible</strong></h2><p>This rich coming from a Star-Lord one-trick. But do as I say, not as I do. Switching heroes is key to games like <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>, but it’s very easy to get stuck on one character you really mesh with. However, if you’re losing a match and just can’t seem to get the upper hand, it might be time to switch. Part of the toxicity that permeates these games is the insistence that someone else on the team should switch off who they’re playing and a toxic player couldn’t possibly be the problem. The truth is, sometimes it’s not about player skill, some heroes are just not built for every situation. If the enemy team is playing Black Widow, having a bunch of airborne heroes she can easily clip the wings of is not going to win you the fight no matter how good you are. You can have your main, but take time to learn at least a few characters you can possibly swap to in a pinch.</p><h2 id="h92984"><a id=""></a><strong>You don’t need to cover every role, but you should always have a healer</strong></h2><p>Role spread is another contentious topic in hero shooters, as some fans like having the flexibility to create team compositions that don’t have to adhere to an equal 2-2-2 formation. At the moment, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t have a role queue that forces the team to pick two of each (Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist), but having at least one of each is a decent rule of thumb when deciding who to play. I had a team who was three duelists and three strategists and we did fine, though. However, the key role in all of this that you should make sure you have at least one (preferably more) of is the Strategist. Straight up, you’re not gonna win fights against a decent enemy team if you don’t have someone who can heal your teammates, and if the randos you group up with are unwilling to do so and you want any chance of winning, maybe consider swapping to one yourself. Yeah, that sometimes means you’ll end up babysitting, but if there’s no one to play the medic, nothing’s going to get done.</p><h2 id="h92985"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t trickle in</strong></h2><p>When you’re lost in the sauce and running on adrenaline after a chaotic fight, it’s easy to run out of spawn to try to get back in the scrap. Trouble is, if you and all your five teammates are doing that but aren’t dying at the same time, you’ll end up trickling in one by one for the enemy team to pick off as you enter their line of sight. If you and your team aren’t all grouped up and pushing an objective as a unit, you’ll get nowhere. Always try to move as a group, and if you are trying to lone-wolf it, make sure you have a plan like flanking the enemy team or surprising them with an ultimate.</p><h2 id="h92986"><a id=""></a><strong>Ultimate charge carries between rounds</strong></h2><p>One of the nice differences between <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch </em>is that Ultimate charge transfers between rounds. This means if you had your Ultimate ready to go or at least close to it in one round, you’ll still have the same percentage when the next round start. As an <em>Overwatch </em>player, it became a habit to use an ult at the end of a round because I might as well hear a cool voice line. It was almost celebratory on a winning round. I did that once in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>on launch night and realized I’d completely forgotten that I’d still have it when the loading screen between rounds was done. So use that to your advantage, as it can give you head start as you and the enemy team descend onto the next point.</p><h2 id="h92987"><a id=""></a><strong>For your sanity’s sake, group up with friends</strong></h2><p>This is a general good idea for most team-based multiplayer games. Grab at least a friend or two before you head online. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is a pretty chaotic game, even with a team of people on voice chat, and thus far I’ve had even less luck solo queuing than I typically have in <em>Overwatch</em>. I’ve always believed the notion of one person carrying in a team-based game to be a power fantasy that is rarely achievable, but it feels especially difficult to pull off in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>right now. Maybe matches will become more lopsided as players learn the game, but for now, try to find people you can coordinate with. You’ll have a much better experience that way.</p><hr><p>We’ll have a full review of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>up in the coming days, but for now, here’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920">our thoughts</a></span> on how NetEase’s comic book hero shooter stands against its obvious inspiration.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(Heck, does this mean <em>Bookworm</em> was the earlier version of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, but with spelling instead of cards?) Anyway, point is, turns out it also works when it’s one of those grabby claw machines.

Each turn (usually) lets you take two grabs, with those two lots of retrieved items used to attack and defend between enemy turns. Via that <em>Slay The Spire</em> model, you then choose map directions, and thus enter event rooms, literal gacha machine treasure spots, upgrade shops, and many other fights.</p><p>That’s the basics, but what makes <em>Dungeon Clawler</em> quite so interesting—beyond the central gimmick being ridiculously hooky (pun so bloody intended)—is that the Early Access game goes to so many other involving places, with a huge pile of novel twists and ideas. For instance, there’s water, and there’s honey. If honey gets into the large container, then swords and throwing stars and golden shields and poisonous knives will all get stuck together, which is great for getting a bunch of stuff at once, but bad if it’s too heavy for the claw and you get nothing. Then water (and other liquids) can fill the tank and dissolve the glue but make items usefully float at the top, and indeed fill weapons like sponges and water pistols, which is especially good if you poison the water in there…</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

Certain items are more powerful if gathered entirely alone, which makes you want to be more delicate with the claw, but giant handfuls of stuff at once can be a match-winner. You can upgrade items, making them more powerful, but also they can get bigger and so harder to pick up, so you’ll want to grab an ability that causes items to shrink. You can transmute items to have different material properties, such that wooden swords can become metallic and thus magnetic… And on and on and on. There are so many excellent details, letting you adjust your plans based on what you can gather, offering far more sophistication than the initial simple premise suggests.</p><p>So much of this is thanks to the excellent physics. They exude fairness, items flinging and clattering around in a way that makes natural sense, meaning you can have really good instincts about where to drop the claw, and when to close the pincers—and indeed why something might slip out or fly off, without feeling like you’ve been cheated.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-recommend-id="image://b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Stray Fawn Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-recommend-id="image://b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Right now, weeks into its Early Access, it already feels incredibly complete. However, there’s a good amount of balancing that needs doing. There are all manner of characters to play as, with unique starting conditions—bonus shield at the cost of health, for instance, or water-based skills for the loss of other abilities—and they unlock quickly and encourage experimentation, but pretty much all of them can hit the same brick wall of a particular enemy type. There’s one foe who doubles his damage each turn, and so without a particularly aggressive build, it’s pretty much game over if you encounter him too early; there’s just little chance you have shields at a point where you can cope. That sucks. He’s not alone in terms of being too OP, too early in a run, which is disappointing.</p><p>Yet, I play again. And again. And again. Unlike real-world claw machines, which are essentially a con designed to make small children miserable, here it’s a far more rewarding experience. The claws <em>are</em> weak, and so won’t hold a massive pile of large items, and they <em>do</em> swing wildly such that many an item will fly off as it lurches to the dropping area. But it’s not <em>fixed</em>, and there’s a strong sense of skill as well as luck in what you gather.</p><p>With a bit of tweaking to difficulty, it’d be hard to fault <em>Dungeon Clawler</em>. It absolutely mimics a million games that came before it, but the combination of a unique mechanic <em>and</em> so many interesting innovations of its own within the format means a game I figured would be just “that idea but with a claw machine” (which sounded good to me!) is actually something far more rounded, involving, and interesting in its own right. I just need to figure out how to stop playing. (Oh god, no, now I’m installing it on my phone…)</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buried Treasure</a></span>, <em>a site dedicated to unearthing lesser-known indie games.

The company itself is eager to suggest as much, writing that Genie 2 can "generate a vast diversity of rich 3D worlds" with emergent capabilities such as "object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Below (as pictured) are example videos of people interacting with Genie 2. For every example, the model is prompted with a single image generated by&nbsp;Imagen 3, GDM’s state-of-the-art text-to-image model," says the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This means anyone can describe a world they want in text, select their favorite rendering of that idea, and then step into and interact with that newly created world (or have an AI agent be trained or evaluated in it). At each step, a person or agent provides a keyboard and mouse action, and Genie 2 simulates the next observation. Genie 2 can generate consistent worlds for up to a minute, with the majority of examples shown lasting 10-20s."</span></p><p>Image via Google</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The examples selected by Google to showcase its new model are uniform in their sterility. Character models wander vapid interpretations of forests and deserts, scarcely populated with structures and foliage looped on repeat. Pyramids that bend and warp as the camera swings overhead. A forest of trees repeating ad infinitum.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Emergent interactions take the form of basic movements and character animations that flatter to deceive. The short clips shared by Google (which presumably elected to showcase only the finest Genie 2 outputs) feature bland facsimiles of vaguely familiar video game scenarios that quickly fragment and decay when placed under any sort of scrutiny.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Genie 2 generates new plausible content on the fly and maintains a consistent world for up to a minute," states Google. This sentence is not the ringing endorsement the company thinks it is.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Google and other AI companies fail to understand the act of creation">Google and other AI companies fail to understand the act of creation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers (and creatives cut from any cloth) do not aspire to create "plausible content." People (and I'm talking about the humans working on your favorite games, not their corporate employers) create to delight, inspire, entertain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We create to connect with each other and unpack our shared human condition. To create anything is to send fragments of yourself into the eternal aether, hoping that someone, somewhere, will find meaning in the deliberate, unpredictable, collaborative mess that art so often becomes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Google evidently doesn't understand </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers make games, either. There's intentionality behind every single decision, whether it's designing an open-world in service of pacing or mechanics–or baking your narrative into the very fabric of the environment. These are not elements you can simply conjure into being with a string of text or AI-generated image.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Genie 2 is a blunt instrument lacking precision or purpose. Google has spent time and resources creating a tool that can scarcely reproduce the most cliched examples of video game guff. A blurry neon city. Fantasy man on horse. Now, it must convince us the crumbling husks churned out by Genie 2 are worthy of our time and attention. Let's be clear: they are not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right now, they're barely even viable. Google itself has admitted the model is only capable of maintaining consistent worlds for less than a minute. It's like watching the memory of a memory swirling the cosmic drain. There is only degradation and collapse–</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/google-ai-emissions">presumably at great real-world cost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/google-ai-emissions">via The Guardian</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who is all this for? Based on what Google has showcased here, players dreaming of eventually blinking their own games into reality with the help of AI tools will quickly realize their 'creations' are devoid of both style and substance. Two aspects of video games that are unmistakably human.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers, meanwhile, have already shown how existing technologies such as procedural generation can be used make entire galaxies corporeal. Robust asset stores exist for those in need of pre-made building blocks to assist with rapid prototyping or full blown production. Engines like Unity, Unreal, Godot, and GameMaker continue to cater to the needs of developers at all levels–while some might choose to build their own from the ground up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If AI tools like Genie 2 are the solution, what is the problem?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era of layoffs, studio closures, financial upheaval, and mass conglomeration, the biggest challenge facing developers is finding the resources needed to unlock their creativity in a way that feels sustainable. In an industry that's becoming increasingly risk-averse and insular at the top level, developers need those with the deepest wallets to start taking chances on new ideas instead of trying (and so often failing) to replicate the successes of their competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Forget about churning out plausible content. Give developers what they need to pull their most abstract, ambitiousideas into reality. If you really want innovation, invest in people.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

		<p><em>We've been a bit sports-centric lately at Remap lately, albeit some of it against our will. We knew the Chicago Bears would garner a lot of attention this season, but we didn't anticipate it would look like...this. </em></p><p><em>This is our burden, our curse, and we're glad (??) to share it with you. It's always a treat to check Bluesky and seeing countless people doing sicko mode, hoping we'll record a podcast about yet another Chicago Bears misery event. Fortunately for you, we've obliged.</em></p><p><em>We don't always watch the Chicago Bears! Arguably, we shouldn't! But you watch enough sports for enough years that you start to develop really strong thoughts about how you're watching those sports, too.</em></p><p><em>You know Rob is on one when he randomly sends Patrick a link to a Google Docs page with several hundreds words strongly engaging with the format of a football television broadcast. </em></p><p><em>What else do you think we started Remap for?</em> </p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Now Patrick, you <em>know</em> I hate Jeff Bezos and Amazon Web Services <em>BUT: </em>I have to hand it to them: Thursday Night Football is the best broadcast in sports right now.</p><p>There are critiques you can level against it: the games are frequently bad, a problem that has dogged Thursday Night Football since the NFL started pushing it as a way to get more games into primetimes TV programming. By definition a Thursday night game is out-of-sync with the regular rhythm of an NFL season, and most of the times the teams playing it will be on short rest and reduced prep time, which makes for scrappier and less well-played games. Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit are not the most dynamic commentary duo, though I think most of the issues there is actually down to the fact that Herbstreit is about as workmanlike a color analyst as you can get.</p><p>But here’s the thing: TNF on Amazon is the only new NFL product in years that has rivaled or even surpassed Sunday Night Football on NBC. It’s sent out in HDR with a decent 1080 bitrate, which makes it visibly better-looking than any game I get through broadcast networks, a taste of what sports could and should look like if anyone had any incentive to make a better product. The audio mix is awesome, with calls at the line being audible alongside some detailed crowd noise (like the rattling bleachers at the Browns stadium in the snow game there a couple weeks ago). They are terrific at getting great asides, like Jameis Winston’s incredible pre-game speech before leading his team out against the Steelers, where he gets into a good rhythm and realizes he lost his point, so backtracks and clarifies what he meant, all without breaking his “tent revival preacher” persona.&nbsp;</p><p>So far that’s all just a normal football broadcast with a bit more attention to detail. But the thing that really differentiates it is the alternate broadcast, billed as Prime Vision with Next Gen Stats. It’s pitched as the broadcast for stats nerds (which is itself nice given how much gambling lines have overtaken statistical analysis in sports broadcast graphics) where analysis and AI work together to highlight key parts of the game. But the really nice feature of this broadcast is that uses <em>Madden</em>-style spotlighting on key personnel, which makes it <em>way </em>easier to see receiver and pass rusher groupings before the play, and it uses camera angles that give you a better look at football than any other broadcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the time the Prime Vision broadcast uses a wider shot akin to the beloved All-22, where you can see the whole field of play at once, which is the only way for modern football to be comprehensible given the way the passing game has become the cornerstone of the whole league. But they’ve also leaned hard on an overhead angle this year that lets you see the play almost from the perspective of the whiteboard play diagram where every football play is born. As someone who loves watching line play, that angle is the only one that really lets you see how the defense brings pressure and how the offense tries (or fails) to counter it. Crucially, it also really lets you see how critical it is to open up sightlines for the quarterback, which is an aspect of the game that totally gets lost in the side-on view most broadcasts use.</p><p>Amazon is the only player in the sports space that seems to have really thought about how you can present a match in a modern context. Maybe some of their approach was influenced by their need to do a dog-and-pony show for AWS and the various enhancements “AI” can supposedly make to everyday tasks, but it does seem like that brief led them to a novel and more thoughtful production. It really highlights how small and unambitious most of the other broadcasters are in their thinking. You start the week off with Thursday Night Football where you’re getting this rich, cutting-edge presentation and then on Sunday you’re watching Fox, where the big innovation between 2023 and 2024 was sticking a headset on Tom Brady.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@helloimnik?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Nik</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>You are the second person to bring up Amazon Prime Video’s special way of showing the game to me. They stumbled upon it while trying to mess with the configuration options, and suddenly went “hey, uh, did you realize you can watch the game in this completely different way that’s extremely cool?”</p><p>The weirdest part about watching football, compared to just about any other sport, is your inability to fully grasp what is happening on the field. In other sports, replays are important for, say, trying to understand an injury or why a flag was thrown. In football, it’s often because you cannot fucking tell what happened while you were watching, whether because of the sport’s increasingly byzantine rules that determines whether a catch happened, or because the default angle does not accurately portray the flow of plays.</p><p>But this also leads to one of my favorite moments in any football game, when the camera operator, who has most likely been filming football games for a huge chunk of their life, is tricked by what unfolds on the play. Their camera movements follow where the ball is <em>supposed</em> to go, but in reality, it’s going <em>something else entirely</em>. You watch as the camera jerks towards the action and buddy, I’m chuckling the whole time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s actually kinda interesting how little has changed between the origins of NFL broadcasting and now?</p><p>I mean, check out one of the first broadcast NFL games. Naturally, it has the Green Bay Packers:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-was-exclusive-to-playstation-because-sony-was-worried-about-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the early 2000s, Sony faced a new competitor to its PlayStation business when Microsoft launched the original Xbox. With that new competition sparked a genuine concern from Sony that led to them getting exclusive release rights to the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games of the era for the PlayStation 2.</p>



<p>Chris Deering, the former president of PlayStation Europe, recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz,</a> and shed some light as to why  PlayStation wanted an exclusive agreement for GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.</p>



<p>“We were worried when we saw Xbox coming,” Deering said. “We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, ‘How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?’ And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn’t clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game.”</p>



<p>Deering added that PlayStation was “lucky” with the deal because of how it paid off for the company. </p>



<p>“It was very lucky for us,” he said. “And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid.”</p>







<p>The games ultimately saw a release on Xbox, but not before they became the best-selling games in the history of PS2. San Andreas became the best-selling PS2 game ever while the other two games, Vice City and GTA 3, became the third- and fifth-best selling games.</p>



<p>GTA 3 and Vice City released on Xbox on November 4, 2003 while San Andreas came to Xbox in June 2005.</p>

The year-long wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images">counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory">bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</a>, and even registration plates as they hunt for GTA 6 clues. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1 last December, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike York, who worked as an animator at Rockstar New England for six years helping to build Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 before leaving the company in 2017, is a big fan of all the fuss, taking to <a href="https://youtu.be/TnTIV8AFs2o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his YouTube channel</a> to explain that the developers at Rockstar will be getting a kick out of it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"All the developers over there are geeking out about it, trust me," he said. "When I was over there I would have little conversations with people and be like, ‘Did you hear this person found this mystery?’ And they’d go, ‘Oh yeah!’ "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York also suggested that Rockstar is playing up to the conspiracy theories, deliberately avoiding saying anything about the game or when Trailer 2 will be released in order to fuel even more speculation within the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They're reaching and pulling and trying to come up with these really cool theories to decipher when the next trailer will be,” he said of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Specifically Rockstar, they're very secretive about what they do, and this is a really cool tactic because it creates allure and it creates mystery and it creates people talking about it without them having to do anything. The more they're silent the better it is, because the more people will be antsy and want to talk about it and have this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York went on to say that Rockstar is likely resisting pressure from its army of fans to announce the GTA 6 Trailer 2 release date for this exact reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could easily release the trailer date and be like, ‘Hey this is when the trailer's coming out,’ but they don't do it. And they don't do it on purpose because it's a really, really good marketing tactic. If you think about it, it creates these really cool theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This brings the fans together. This is a really cool way to get fans to talk about your game when you’re not releasing anything yet, in-between the times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All these theories are great. They only create hype, they create talk, they create mystery behind the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Rockstar actually be placing clues to things like trailer release dates in GTA Online images, as the moon theory has suggested?

The company’s next big game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, was delayed into 2025, and Star Wars Outlaws failed to meet sales expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>, Ubisoft shareholders are “considering” how to structure a possible buyout of the French company without reducing the founding Guillemot family’s control. The Guillemot family is the largest shareholder in Ubisoft and is reportedly in talks with Tencent and “other investors” as it seeks funding a management buyout. Tencent is the second-largest shareholder in Ubisoft with 10% and, according to Reuters, has yet to decide whether to fund the buyout.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/gettyimages-2179673307-1733497661112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to 2025. Photo by Dimitar DILKOFF / AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reuters said Tencent’s indecision is “partly because it has asked for a greater say on future board decisions including cash flow distribution in return for financing the deal.” Apparently the Guillemot family has yet to agree to those terms, but Tencent is willing to wait for them to come around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, with a Guillemot family rep failing to respond. But a Ubisoft spokesperson did comment, saying: "We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft’s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it made a series of dramatic announcements around the performance of its games. As well as delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft announced a return to Steam after a period of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, with Star Wars Outlaws recently releasing on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest news comes hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">Ubisoft's announcement that it plans to shut down Call of Duty competitor XDefiant</a> and its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka while ramping down its site in Sydney, with up to 277 employees losing their jobs. Roughly half of the XDefiant team will be assigned roles elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shares in Ubisoft are up 12.52% today, December 6, following the Tencent buyout reports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">It's beautiful, and no, Digital Foundry isn't talking about the Lost Ark. The tech-analysis outfit examined Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on console--comparing Series X and Series S versions--coming away impressed with what developer MachineGames has done on the platforms.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry's tech review</a> by John Linneman states that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/" data-ref-id="1100-6520456">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> maintains 60fps on both consoles (for the most part) while utilizing ray tracing. Linneman explains that it's rare for a console title to offer open-ended levels, ray tracing, and 60fps together and still perform well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8I4SsQTqaY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b8I4SsQTqaY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">However, there are odd frame-rate dips during cutscenes for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Linneman writes that unlike the developer's Wolfenstein series, all cutscenes in this title are rendered in real time. But, other than this quirk, the action-adventure game runs "perfect[ly] on console" from a performance perspective. In fact, loading times are so fast they're barely noticeable, noted Linneman.</p><p dir="ltr">The Xbox Series X version of the game is better looking, offering 1800p most of the time from a visual perspective. Meanwhile, Series S sits around 1080p or lower. This leads to a blurrier presentation, even a bit blotchy at times. In addition, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has more of a glow and worse shadows on Xbox Series S.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, we learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-will-let-you-shoot-puzzles-with-your-camera-to-solve-them/1100-6528192/" data-ref-id="1100-6528192">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will let you shoot puzzles (with your camera) to solve them</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-unlock-times-and-how-to-play-early/1100-6528168/" data-ref-id="1100-6528168">The game is already unlocked</a> for people who purchased the Premium or Collector's editions of the title.

Each set will include 400 cards and a playmat with rule variants for more casual play and tournament settings. The tabletop companies say the physical edition has the “full support” of CD Projekt Red. </p><p>The beauty of Gwent was two-fold. First, it was perfectly integrated into the larger world of <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Monster slayer Geralt of Rivia could challenge opponents at the pub or in the royal court and wager money, collecting cards and expanding his reputation, including through a Gwent tournament with important ties to the narrative. Second, the game itself was thoughtful but streamlined, letting players bluff and deploy clever tactics without having to engage in some of the more convoluted TCG mechanics of a <em>Hearthstone</em> or <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="cea96d43113b6930442c55f5472b34d5" data-recommend-id="image://cea96d43113b6930442c55f5472b34d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2295" data-height="1291" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Renders of the physical Gwent cards are displayed.

While the project eventually spawned a single-player story-based game called <em>Thronebreaker</em>, the card game’s stalled growth and the studio’s other ambitious projects ultimately led it to be abandoned, first on console and then on PC and mobile as well. </p><p>What CDPR did do, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.si.com/videogames/news/gwent-the-witcher-card-game-final-update#:~:text=It's%20the%20end%20of%20an,year%20by%20the%20Polish%20developer.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/gwent-the-witcher-card-game-final-update#:~:text=It's%20the%20end%20of%20an,year%20by%20the%20Polish%20developer." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is not let the game simply die</a></span>, but instead keep the servers online and empower top players to continue tweaking the balance, to support fans who remained even if there was no new content or big update coming.

Maybe even with a few twists. In the meantime, it’s nice to know fans can immortalize their love of the niche card game with a real-life version. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hazelight founder Josef Fares shared a tease for the studio's yet-to-actually-be-announced game earlier in the year, with an enigmatic post on social media which promised "a BRAND NEW IP called S*** ******N".</p>
<p>At this time, our own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">Matt Wales suggested the game could be called 'Sexy Bassoon'</a>, and to be honest, I am slightly disappointed it is looking less likely that this is its name. Anyway, not much longer until we find out more about what Hazelight has been cooking up since It Takes Two.</p>

<p>Back in October, Hazelight announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">It Takes Two has now sold a rather impressive 20m copies</a> since its release in 2021. This meant the game had sold a further 4m copies since March of this year, when the developer announced the game had sold 16m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Strange Scaffold has announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, a game that they describe as a turn-based beat ’em up coming to PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>TMNT Tactical Takedown puts you in control of each of the four turtles as they take the fight to the Foot Clan in turn-based tactical battles. Each level drops your turtle into a small space with a bunch of enemies, charging you with dispatching all the foes as quickly as possible using their specific movesets to control the space and movement.</p>
<p>There’s some obvious parallels to Fights in Tight Spaces, and before that mini turn-based tactical Into the Breach as well, but those comparisons are hardly a bad thing. It just proves that this concept can work really, really well.</p>
<p>The game comes from Strange Scaffold, the developer behind I Am Your Beast, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more.</p>

<p>Studio founder Xalavier Nelson Jr. said, “Building a truly powerful licensed game requires a deep respect for the source material, love for the fans, and a willingness to challenge tentpoles of the universe to create something that both surprises and delights.</p>
<p>Bringing that kind of experience to life requires an equally powerful relationship – so I will be forever grateful to Doug Rosen and the team at Paramount for their collaboration, and putting their trust in our team to make an original take on the world that soars. I get to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game where the very first lines of dialogue establish that Shredder and Splinter are dead. Who else can say that?”</p>
<p>We’re in a rich period for TMNT fans and gamers, with the recent resurgence of the beat ’em up genre seeing the great new release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Shredder’s Revenge</a> and retro revival <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">Cowabunga Collection</a>, as well as new genre spin-offs with the roguelike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>. Just avoid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-arcade-wrath-of-the-mutants-review/">Wrath of the Mutants</a> – that one’s not a very good game…</p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2-focused event is being planned for May, suggesting, together with industry chatter, that the console could be released this June.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the latest episode of their podcast</a>, well-known insider NateDrake provided an update on the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing and potential release date. Commenting on the rumored June release window for the system that's been making the rounds in the past few days, the insider mentioned that as of late September, early October, there's been a lot of industry chatter that placed the Nintendo Switch 2 release window between late May to June.&nbsp;There's still some uncertainty regarding this, but partners and publishers have been considering it as the release window for the system for the time being.</p>
<p>While NateDrake could not confirm if the Nintendo Switch 2 is indeed releasing in the late May-June release window, the insider did reveal that an event focused on the system is currently being planned for May. The nature of the event is not clear, but it could be similar to the January 2017 event where Nintendo invited the media for some hands-on time with the original Switch. If the Japanese company was following a similar timeframe, the timing of the event suggests that the Nintendo Switch 2 could indeed be released in June, which would be a great time to launch the system with the hands-on opportunities that could be offered during summer events like the Summer Game Fest and PAX East to generate more buzz on the system.</p>

<p>There's little doubt that partners are getting ready for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, as images and listings for the new<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/"> Joy-Con controller</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba/">accessories</a> have started appearing online. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to finally see what Nintendo has been working on for reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">quite a long time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games continues to tout the growth of its VALORANT esports scene, now having completed two seasons of its international partnership league. Like it does with League of Legends, Riot has completely run VALORANT esports all by itself since the game launched in 2020.</p>



<p>Prior to the start of the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season, Riot has announced the end-of-year results for its 2024 campaign, revealing yet another massive chunk of change brought in by player spending.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-comes-the-money">Here comes the money</h2>



<p>According to Riot, the company shared $44.3 million from digital goods with the partnered teams competing in VCT 2024, up from <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-US/news/vct-2023-eoy-letter-to-the-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$33 million in 2023</a>. With 44 teams competing across the four leagues last year, that averages out to just about $1 million per team. Since Riot takes 50 percent of the revenue from digital goods, that means that players spent roughly $88.6 million in total on VCT-themed digital goods.</p>



<p>The digital goods in question refer to two primary items: VCT partner team capsules and the Champions bundle. At the start of the year, Riot introduced VCT partner team capsules, which both teams and fans were highly anticipating. Each team had a bundle with a team-specific Classic pistol skin, a player card designed by the team itself, a logo gun buddy (charm), and a logo spray. New capsules are expected to be released near the start of the 2025 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The other main draw for digital goods is the yearly Champions bundle, which includes unique weapon skins and accessories celebrating the VALORANT world championship. This year, for the first time, all partnered teams received a share of Champions bundle revenue, not just the 16 teams that qualified for the event.</p>



<p>Between digital goods, stipends, and prize pool winnings, Riot claims to have given out $78.4 million across the 44 partnered teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there a specific VALORANT team bundle you want to buy next year? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studio%E2%80%99s-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online.1053915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studios-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next title developed by Hazelight Studios has leaked online from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable leaker billbil-kun</a>, who has said that the next game is called Split Fiction and is due out on March 6, 2025, on PC and console. Of course, this is just a leak for now, so we don't know whether it is true or not, and you'll have to take it with a pinch of salt. It's said that a reveal trailer for the game is supposed to be released this month and that the game will be announced at The Game Awards, which will be taking place next week.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios has Josef Fares at the helm, the designer of A Way Out, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and It Takes Two. All of these games are published under EA's Originals banner. Split Fiction has the potential to be great, as all three of those games have won awards, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/returnal-it-takes-two-2022-bafta-games-awards-nominations/">It Takes Two</a> winning the most out of the three and being nominated for many more. With that in mind, it's a fair assumption to feel that Split Fiction will equally be full of promise.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is apparently another co-op adventure game being made by Hazelight, which, considering the games that both Hazelight and Josef Fares have worked on, it makes total sense that this is the direction they would go with, especially with the wide success of It Takes Two.</p>
<p>It is known that Hazelight Studios has been working on a new game, as both the Hazelight Studios and Josef Fares social media accounts posted about the upcoming title, confirming that a game was in development. Josef Fares even goes on to post, "Here is a tease. It is a BRAND NEW IP called S**** ******N. Can't wait to show it soon." Considering the number of letters censored and what it begins and starts with, it seems that billbil-kun is right on the money about the title of the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have more details than that, and you'll have to wait and see if the upcoming title Split Fiction is announced by Hazelight Studios at The Game Awards, which is only a week away.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-and-krafton-announce-payday-pubg-crossover.1053906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze and Krafton have announced a&nbsp;<em>PUBG Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, with the latter set to infiltrate the world of the former through what sounds like a new gameplay experience within&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-partners-with-krafton-to-expand-payday-into-pubg-battlegrounds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement on Starbreeze's website</a>, the studio says the crossover is about increasing "the visibility and reach of the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise", which Starbreeze aims to do by "bringing the heisting experience to a broader audience through&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>".</p>

<p>It's a goal that Starbreeze rather desperately needs to chase right now, since&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s in a bit of a tight spot. Recently, <em>Payday 3</em> saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">its director step down</a> in the run-up to its first anniversary, and the game's poor performance also led to Starbreeze's CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">quitting back in March</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=n-GvAGi8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=qXEtFWam 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the explosive, high-octane world of&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement, the collaboration will involve "about a quarter of Starbreeze's development organization during a year" under what Starbreeze calls a "work-for-hire agreement".</p>

<p>It sounds, then, like Starbreeze will be creating the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>content that will make its way into&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The two studios say they're "currently collaborating on the project's integration roadmap", and we'll get more updates later down the line.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky road for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, with Starbreeze admitting back in February that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">performing at "significantly lower levels"</a> than it wanted.</p>

<p>Perhaps more embarrassingly for Starbreeze,&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>is currently leagues ahead of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the Steam player count stakes; at last count,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was 860</a>, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s stood at a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">far more respectable 38,324</a>.</p>

The game's 24-hour Steam player peak is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/578080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a princely 756,872</a>, which probably goes some way towards explaining why Starbreeze wants to integrate&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>into the battle royale hit.</p>

<p>With regards to the two studios' future plans, Krafton is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of survival hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, and it's also overseeing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">a sequel</a> to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, the IP for which (along with developer Tango Gameworks) it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">bought earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, meanwhile, is engaged in a multi-stage plan to try and improve&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes, and the studio is also working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">multiplayer game using the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>IP</a>.</p>

Tencent is said to have asked for a greater say on future board decisions in return, which the Guillemot family has not agreed to.</p><p>Discussions are reportedly ongoing as Tencent would like to prevent a hostile takeover of Ubisoft by other investors. One person said Tencent’s plan is to remain patient and wait for the Guillemot family to agree to a deal.</p><p>Both Tencent and the Guillemot family declined to comment, but a representative for Ubisoft said, “We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
