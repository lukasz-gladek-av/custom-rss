            <p>
Ubisoft is cooking up multiple Assassin's Creed game remakes, according to company CEO Yves Guillemot. And while he hasn't revealed which ones yet, the news follows reports last year that Ubisoft's much-loved Assassin's Creed Black Flag is getting the remake treatment.
</p>
<p>
Guillemot made the comments in an <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">interview on Ubisoft website</a>, discussing the company's upcoming portfolio. And while it offered little in the way of surprises - Yves once again talked about generative AI NPCs, insisting they could be "more intelligent, more interactive" (and not just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">dead-eyed creepy</a>) - he did manage to share a smattering of fresh information.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to those remakes. In answer to a question about Ubisoft's future plans for the series, Yves revealed, "Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernise them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich."

<p>
That lends credence to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">Kotaku report last year</a> claiming Skull and Bones studio Ubisoft Singapore was "heavily involved" in a remake of fan-favourite pirate-themed Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. However, the project was said to be "still in its earliest stages" and unlikely to be complete "for at least a few years". Of course, Guillemot has now confirmed <em>remakes</em>, opening up a world of possibility - although my money's probably on Assassin's Creed 2. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJcPc6OQ384">best joke in the series</a> deserves another chance to shine.
</p>
<p>
But Guillemot had a little more to say about Assassin's Creed, too. When asked if the difference in approaches between the leaner Mirage and more traditionally hefty upcoming Shadows was indicative of Ubisoft's future plans, Guillemot said, "There will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year."
</p>
<p>
"There are a lot of good things to come," he added, "including Assassin's Creed Hexe, which we've announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin's Creed Shadows. We're going to surprise people, I think."
</p>
<p>
Hexe, of course, is the one of several new series instalments that were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">confirmed to be in development</a> all the way back in September 2022. It's set in 16th century Europe and appears to be targeting a 2026 launch, with the mobile-focused Assassin's Creed Jade expected first in 2025. As for this year's feudal-Japan-set <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, that's coming to PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on 15th November.

However, according to Valve’s Lawrence Yang, the listing isn’t strictly based on the number of players in each game.</p><div><blockquote><p>“The metric we’re using to determine top-played is a combination of unique users and interest. <em>Hades 2</em> has only been out for a month, but so many Steam Deck players have it as one of their top played games for the entire year, that it was lifted in the rankings.”</p></blockquote></div><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Valve to clarify how interest in a game is being determined. (We’ll update this post when we hear back.)</p><p>The new chart includes the current pricing and promotions for the top 100 titles (it’s launching on the same day that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185077/valve-steam-summer-sale-steam-deck-lcd-pc-deal-sale">Valve’s Summer Sale</a> is getting underway, which includes a discount on the LCD Steam Deck), day-to-day changes in each game’s ranking, and whether the title is verified for the console so it runs without compatibility issues.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">If you been playing recently in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s PvP arena, the Crucible, you've almost certainly faced a lot of players tossing healing turrets and laying down a ton of fire with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-khvostov-7g-0x-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/1100-6524183/" data-ref-id="1100-6524183">Khvostov-7G0X</a>, the new and grindy-to-unlock Exotic auto rifle that can be earned in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape expansion</a>. Khvostov has dominated PvP as of late, but Bungie is nerfing the gun in ways that are likely to reel in its Crucible supremacy.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just Khvostov that's getting adjusted, either. In its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_06_27_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny blog post</a>, Bungie addressed three Exotics that are currently seeing a ton of use in the Crucible, and particularly in high-stakes Trials of Osiris weekend multiplayer event. Those are Red Death Reformed, a pulse rifle players get from the current season pass, and Speaker's Sight, an Exotic helmet for Warlocks. Khvostov and Speaker's Sight work particularly well together for an easy-to-use strategy that boosts the gun's power, while Red Death Reformed hits hard and heals its user when they score a kill, making it the go-to response to Khvostov.</p><p dir="ltr">A few things are going on with Khvostov to make it so strong. First off: It's bugged. Khvostov's Exotic perk makes its bullets occasionally ricochet, bouncing around and hitting multiple targets while dealing additional damage. Bungie said it wanted to reduce the recoil created by those ricochet bullets in particular, but the glitch in how the gun works caused <em>all</em> the bullets to receive that reduced recoil.</p><p dir="ltr">That means that Khvostov essentially gets maximum stability, reducing its kickback and making it <em>extremely</em> easy to use to land headshots. The gun also has very high aim assist, the stat that helps your bullets land where you want them. So taken together, both the low recoil and the high aim assist make Khvostov extremely easy to use well, and that's before you even take the ricochet bullets into consideration.</p><p dir="ltr">Those ricochet bullets get a boost whenever you pick up an Orb of Light, and this is where the Speaker's Sight Exotic helmet comes into play. That helmet allows Warlocks to turn their grenades into healing turrets, and whenever they drop one of those turrets, they generate an Orb of Power, instantly buffing Khvostov. So not only is the gun barely recoiling and making it easy to land headshots, but it's also firing ricochet rounds that can hit multiple targets and are easily powered up for even more damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie's addressing those issues by fixing the recoil bug on Khvostov, but it's trying not to make it <em>too much</em> worse. Players have been enjoying the low-recoil version of the gun, and Bungie wants to maintain that Exotic feel, so it's lowering its overall Stability level to 72, down 30 points. That should make it pretty stable, but not incredibly stable.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the ricochet bullets, which deal damage both on initial impact and on their ricochet strikes, Bungie feels they're too strong and too easy to activate in PvP, essentially giving a big damage buff to Khvostov users that's similar to much harder-to-activate perks on other guns. The initial bonus damage of a ricochet round is being reduced, from 15% to 5%, while the bouncing bullets are being ratcheted down from 18.4 points of damage on a hit to 4.6 damage. Bungie says those changes will maintain how often ricochets are happening, but make them less overwhelmingly powerful. However, Bungie doesn't want to alter how Khvostov feels in PvE activities, so those changes only apply to how the gun works in the Crucible.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Speaker's Sight, as of right now, the Exotic helmet's ability to generate Orbs of Power is being turned off in the Crucible altogether. Speaker's Sight will still generate Orbs normally in PvE, however.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie acknowledged that the helmet is making it too easy to generate a lot of Orbs of Power too easily in the Crucible, and that can give a big advantage for a lot of different player builds. While Bungie wants to maintain the fantasy the helmet facilitates--namely, of being a very focused healer--the developer says it needs to find a better balance between that function and how useful Orbs of Power can be in the Crucible.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, there's Red Death Reformed. Like Khvostov, it also benefits from high Stability and a tight recoil pattern that makes it very easy to use effectively in the Crucible, but unlike Khvostov, this is by design. Red Death has a special recoil pattern meant to make it fire tighter bursts than most pulse rifles, but Bungie says it has turned out to be <em>too</em> good at dealing out death against players, so the developer is bringing down the Stability stat a bit. The result should be that Red Death Reformed still has a specific feel when firing it and is still pretty effective, but with a little more kick that should balance it better against other pulse rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">As with all balancing changes when it comes to the Crucible, we'll have to wait and see how these changes alter the state of the PvP meta and whether they're enough to weaken Khvostov's dominance, or go too far and wind up taking it out of the rotation entirely. Destiny 2's Iron Banner kicks off next week, which should provide plenty of information on how the community receives the changes.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-frostpunk-2-its-not-the-cold-thats-your-enemy-but-human-nature">Frostpunk 2</a> is being delayed so its developers have time to address player feedback gathered during the beta earlier this year. The survival citybuilder was originally due to begin shovelling orphans into the furnace in July, but those dear children now have a reprieve until September 20th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Based on the surveys we received from you after playing, the average rating you gave the Beta was 8 out of 10," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775">the announcement of the delay</a>. "We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, the Beta was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, the Beta was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet. This allowed us to prioritize things better, and bring to the front the features and modifications we were already working on (we hope!) you’ll enjoy the most."
</p>
<p>To deliver those newly prioritised features and "guarantee the best possible experience at launch," 11bit say they need more time.
</p>
<p>The full announcement goes into some detail about the changes that are being introduced since the beta, and they don't sound small. Temperature and heat-based systems, a core part of the Frostpunk experience, are being revised. A new resource is being introduced to make city-building "more strategic". Players will be able to modify city districts after they're first constructed. Faction behaviour will more closely align to their lore. The UI is being revamped to make the world more readable. 
</p>
<p>11bit are also adding a new feature they call "Zoom Stories", which will let you snap closer to your city in order to "watch the day-to-day life of your citizens." The aim is to make players feel more attached to those orphans as in the short spell before you shovel them into the furnace.
</p>
<p>Matt Cox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2-reveals-a-wasteland-thats-more-about-wheelin-and-dealin-than-mere-survivin">enjoyed his time with the Frostpunk 2 beta</a> back in April, finding it "quite promising" after playing a relatively "small sliver" of the full game. We'll now need to wait longer before we find out whether that promise has been fulfilled.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new episode of the AnsweRED podcast</a> mainly focuses on a chat with the developers leading the work on Project Orion, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly built Boston studio</a> can bring to the game.&nbsp;Acting Executive Producer Dan Hernberg explained:</p>
<p><em>I think Cyberpunk is obviously a uniquely American story. It's got a lot of like punk energy, and it was written by an American, so it just seems right to do it in America.</em></p>
<p>Associate Game Director Paweł Sasko also shared a specific example: Cyberpunk 2077, which was made in Poland, had the wrong manhole covers for a US-based city.</p>
<p><em>There's this interesting story after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 that blew up on Reddit at some point, and it's the manhole debacle. Like, the manholes that are covering the roads, right? There was this post with the guy saying that there is this immersive breaking bug in Cyberpunk, and the bug was about the fact that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement. Those are not manholes that you normally cover in America on the streets.</em></p>
<p><em>This is basically showing you the differences, right? When you go to America, there's things like hydrants, where they are placed and how they look like. The street lights, the positions of that, the trash bins, right? They're in the front of the house, right by the street. In Poland, in Europe, you don't see it almost anywhere. There's so much nuance. Dan, when we talk about it, he calls it the Americana.</em></p>
<p>Dan Hernberg then said:</p>
<p><em>Our curbs are different, our color is different on all of our signs. Everything's just slightly different.&nbsp; It doesn't break immersion, but it's just that little thing where you're like, "Well, maybe this wasn't made by people who live here or people who fully understand all of American culture."</em></p>
<p><em>I also think that being in America, it allows us to have those cultural touchpoints with the larger American, you know, kind of influence with Hollywood. Obviously, Cyberpunk 2077 took place in LA, and so there's just kind of all these cultural touchpoints and things that we can kind of interact with, whether that's from music or story or just different parts of America that are interesting to explore.</em></p>
<p>One of the perks of the Boston studio is that CD Projekt RED will be able to tap into the North American talent pool, including graduates from high-profile universities like Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Moreover, they are collaborating with the existing Vancouver studio on Project Orion, with Hernberg teasing that the Canadian team is working on some 'really cool stuff' for the sequel.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel is undoubtedly going to take a while to materialize. That said, CD Projekt RED obviously built the new studio specifically to build the game in parallel with the new The Witcher saga. Indeed, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-aims-to-increase-the-cadence-of-game-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims to speed up the cadence of its game releases</a>, so you can hold on to that hope of playing Orion within this decade.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s beloved driving MMO, The Crew, was taken offline on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-taking-the-crew-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 31, 2024</a>. But the game’s community hasn’t given up; some are yet pushing hard to revive the game. In a heartwarming display of dedication, a group of passionate modders, Whammy 4, have announced their commitment to resurrect the title. </p>



<p>Their upcoming project, The Crew Offline+Online Server Emulator, showcases their unwavering love for the game. Through this project, they aim not only to restore the game to its former glory but also to add new features that the developers never did, giving the community a renewed sense of hope.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-in-business">Back in Business</h2>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> interviewed a member of the Whammy4 team, and they spoke more about the project. The member stated that the team had begun work on their project as soon as Ubisoft announced The Crew’s closure in December 2023. </p>



<p>The member said that their project retains the same game everyone knows and loves, but instead of using Ubisoft’s servers, the community will have to use Whammy4’s servers to access the game. Whammy4 recently released a new video on YouTube: The Crew – First Roadtrip After The Shutdown.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Crew - First Roadtrip After The Shutdown" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIo4l-BpK8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The Whammy4 member then speaks about game preservation, stating that if things keep on going the way they are now, then pretty soon, most video games that players love will become dead video games. Hence, game preservation should be the utmost priority “before the situation spins out of control.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Returning to The Crew, Whammy4 talks about how this is the only title where players get to cruise around a scaled-down and open-world version of the United States of America, and “to give up on such a remarkable game would be a crime.” Whammy4 believes they should be able to get the project up and running for the franchise’s 10th Anniversary, which arrives in December 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft revealed The Crew Motorfest’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-motorfest-year-2-plans-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 2 plans</a> earlier this month. Are you excited about The Crew being revived? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/27/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>As BioWare prepared to show me the character creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in its Edmonton, Canada, offices, I expected something robust – it's 2024, character creators have come a long way, and Bioware has a rich history of good customization. Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart of it is inclusivity, Veilguard game director Corinne Busche tells me before letting me guide her through creating my own character.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="25af3836-ce01-4d19-ba05-b9c3fa20f533" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>As is usual, there are four races to choose from: Elves, Qunari, Humans, and Dwarves. After selecting Qunari, Busche pages through various presets, explaining the game allows for more detailed looks at each and the ability to choose pronouns with she/her, he/him, and they/them separately from gender, select different body types, and more. You can view your character, referred to as Rook in-game, in four different lighting scenes at any time, including The Veilguard's keynote purple hue, a bright and sunny tropical day, and a gothic night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I joke with the team that after spending upwards of an hour creating my Dragon Age: Inquisition character in 2014, I immediately restarted the game after seeing him in the first cutscene; the in-game lighting made my hair color look terrible amongst other issues I had with my Inquisitor. Veilguard creative director John Epler says the team is aware of countless stories like that with Inquisition and its green-hued character creator, adding BioWare worked hard to squash that concern in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Head and body presets can be selected individually and customized to your liking with 40 different complexions that include smooth, rugged, youthful, and freckled skin tones, skin hues ranging from cool to neutral to warm, undertones to those skin tones, and even a melanin slider. Busche tells me BioWare relied on consultation to represent all people authentically. There's a Vitiligo slider (where you can adjust the intensity and amount of it) and sliders for your forehead, brow, cheeks, jaw, chin, larynx, and scalp. You can select your undergarments, with nudity as well because "this is a mature RPG," Busche adds, and use the "Body Morpher" to select three presets for each corner of a triangle and then move a cursor within it to morph your body or head into a mix of these presets. It's an impressive technology I'd like to see adopted in other games.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>I can keep going: You can adjust height, shoulder width, chest size, glute and bulge size, hip width, how bloodshot your eyes are, how visible cataracts are, the sclera color, how crooked your nose is, how big its bridge is, the size of nostrils and the nose tip, and there are as many sliders, if not more, for things like Rook's mouth and ears. On ears alone, I see you can adjust asymmetry, depth, rotation, earlobe size, and even add cauliflower ear to your Rook. Busche says makeup blends modern stylings with the fantasy of Dragon Age with more than 30 options, including eyeliner intensity, color, glitter, eye shadow, lips, and blush.</p>

<p>Tattoos are just as customizable alongside options for scars and paint. Tattoos, scars, and paint are very culturally relevant to some lineages, BioWare tells me, with unique tattoos for elves, for example. You can add tattoos to Rook's face, body, arms, and legs, and you can adjust things like intensity, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Im most impressed, however, by the hair options on display; there are a ton, and as someone with long hair, I'm especially excited about the fun selections I can make. You can finally dye your hair with non-traditional colors, and it's gorgeous. EA's Frostbite engine uses the Strand system to render each style fully with physics. "The technology has finally caught up to our ambition," Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes says.</p>

<p>After customizing all of that and selecting our Qunari's horn type and material (of which there are more than 40 options to choose from), it's time to pick a class out of the Rogue, Mage, and Warrior – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/25/breaking-down-dragon-age-the-veilguards-classes-and-factions">read more about Veilguard's classes here</a>. Since we built a Qunari, we went with Warrior. For the penultimate step of the character creator, at least during the demo BioWare shows me, we select a faction. Out of the six options, we select the pirate-themed Lords of Fortune.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>"Rook ascends because of competency, not because of a magical McGuffin," BioWare core lead and Mass Effect executive producer Michael Gamble tells me in contrast to Inquisition's destiny-has-chosen-you-characterization.</p>

<p>"Rook is here because they choose to be and that speaks to the kind of character that we've built," Busche adds. "Someone needs to stop this, and Rook says, 'I guess that’s me.'"</p>

<p>Ready to begin our Rook's journey, we select a first and last name and one of four voices out of English masculine, English feminine, American masculine, or American feminine options. There's a pitch shifter for each voice, too, allowing you to tweak it to your liking further.</p>

  <p id="DvX0dH"><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> isn’t so much a spinoff and prequel of John Krasinski’s 2018 horror movie as it is a riveting drama that plays in the series’ sandbox. You can spot the odd bit of new world-building here or there, about just how and why there are so many damn echolocating aliens, but these tidbits are just background noise (<em>shh, not so loud!</em>) to a much more interesting human story. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/9/17216604/a-quiet-place-parenting"><em>A Quiet Place</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22459067/a-quiet-place-part-ii-review"><em>A Quiet Place Part II</em></a> are rural sci-fi horror, but <em>Day One</em> — from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/7/26/22594110/new-movies-watch-pig-nic-cage-netflix-blood-red-sky"><em>Pig</em></a> director Michael Sarnoski — moves the setting to New York City and crafts its story in the vein of large-scale disaster cinema. It’s likely the best Manhattan mayhem film since <em>Cloverfield</em>, and it’s also a downright excellent Hollywood blockbuster, if an entirely unexpected one.</p>
<p id="UdjTtO">A first-time indie filmmaker being subsumed by the studio system can be cause for concern — it’s usually a sign they’ve been hired to execute a board room’s vision — but <em>A</em> <em>Quiet Place: Day One</em> has Sarnoski written all over it, as a genre filmmaker who finds emotional resonance where most might not think to look. <em>Pig</em>, which initially seemed like “<em>John Wick</em>, but with a chef and his beloved sow,” proved surprisingly thoughtful in its unraveling of grief, a sleight-of-hand gambit that applies to Sarnoski’s horror threequel, too. <em>Day One</em> is as much about confronting oblivion as it is about confronting aliens, for reasons the movie’s seemingly omnipresent trailers have avoided revealing.</p>

<p id="K2OUdu">When <em>Day One</em> opens, its lead character, the former poet Sam (Lupita Nyong’o), is wasting away in a hospice facility, frustrated by her terminal cancer diagnosis, and searching for any reason to lash out. She has just weeks to live, if that, which makes her an especially intriguing centerpiece in a film like this one. Whether she survives the movie is barely relevant, compared to how the experience of living through the end of the world as we know it will change her. The plot’s possibilities are finite, but the film’s emotional possibilities are endless, even within the series’ sci-fi confines.</p>
<p id="tnjHbX">The beats of the previous Quiet Place movies are present, but simplified: giant, insect-like monsters viciously kill anyone who makes noise. Everyone who doesn’t die in the first wave figures this out quickly, without burdening the audience with a guessing game where we already know the answers. But the movie is set so far in the series’ past — several years before the <em>Quiet Place</em> characters find the aliens’ weakness — that there’s practically no hope for a solution, or for humanity to fight back. At no point are these extraterrestrials framed like slasher-movie serial killers, with creeping one-on-one encounters the humans might possibly win. They function more like a force of nature, an inevitable doom sweeping through the streets of Manhattan, akin to an unrelenting hurricane attracted to noise. </p>
<p id="AjBp3j">Not only is New York the worst possible place to be when this specific apocalypse hits — the movie’s opening text claims the city’s average noise pollution is 90 decibels, the same as a human scream — but it’s a particularly thorny place to set a disaster movie in general. Like<em> Cloverfield</em>, though, <em>A Quiet Place:</em> <em>Day One </em>doesn’t shy away from the specter of 9/11, and the indelible news footage that came out of it. When the city becomes ground zero for the invasion, Sarnoski immediately envelops the characters in a disorienting cloud of dust.</p>

<p id="zkYDsH">The film, it turns out, is as much about New York as it is about the characters and the series’ central gimmick. Sarnoski treats the city’s neighborhoods and architecture as a distinct terrain. (Though he takes liberties when it comes to subway station design — New Yorkers will have a lot to say about those.) By the end, the film isn’t just about New York’s history; in subtle ways, it’s about people’s personal relationship to a changing urban landscape and the memories it holds. Some spaces, in <em>Day One</em>, are just spaces; they’re dull and functional. But some, which hold specific meaning, are presented with an ethereal glow. </p>
<p id="doiUTz">The spectacle of vehicles being tossed helter-skelter and familiar landmarks being damaged beyond repair is a key part of any disaster film’s allure. Sarnoski imbues these traditional visual cues with immense emotional weight, though, by focusing on how people would realistically react to experiencing them. This trajectory seems strangely idiosyncratic at first. When Sam visits the city with her cat, Frodo (a cute reference — they’re an inseparable pair), on a bus full of fellow patients chaperoned by kindly nurse Reuben (Alex Wolff), she’s intent on eating her favorite slice of New York pizza. This also remains her objective even when everything goes to hell.</p>
<p id="RXxKHr">That may seem like a joke about New Yorkers’ claims of culinary superiority, but the film is on Sam’s wavelength. Her arduous journey from downtown Manhattan to a specific Harlem pizza place is quickly established as an emotionally rooted fixation, a response to the immense trauma she’s facing. If she’s going to die, she wants to do it on her own terms, even if that means charging headfirst toward certain death for a small but familiar comfort.</p>

<p id="8AS1uY">On her way uptown, she runs into an English law student, Eric (Joseph Quinn), who, rather than evacuating, decides to follow her for a reason that seems equally ridiculous. He winds up as the film’s emotional backbone. Sam’s diagnosis had already turned her world upside down: The alien invasion reads like an external manifestation of her spiritual chaos. Eric’s life, by contrast, was on a straightforward path, but the experience of nearly dying on day one shakes him to his core.</p>
<p id="fbvw9m">Survival instinct as a broad concept is a decent enough character motive for a disaster movie, but Sarnoski anchors this idea in simple but powerfully relatable stimuli. In Sam’s case, it’s the specificity of memory. (The pizza place has a deeper significance than is immediately apparent.) For Eric, it’s the simple act of connecting not with Sam, but with Frodo. Under the circumstances, either of these motives is reason enough to push forward, in spite of the emerging complications.</p>
<p id="N6mSGh">As usual for Quiet Place movies, the action is built around moments where the characters want to escape, which clashes with the need to stay absolutely silent. Few theatrical experiences beat the tense realization of<em> </em>Quiet Place sequences where someone inadvertently makes a noise. But the way <em>Day One </em>frames the human voice is a powerful masterstroke. Between Sam’s intense pain as she runs out of medication and Eric’s intense trauma from recent events, the characters don’t just have to avoid making sounds while moving. They instead have to suppress their natures, their primal need to scream as their lives crumble around them. </p>

<p id="MCu1CK">The movie’s tension remains razor-sharp for lengthy periods, but this is also broken up by sweet moments of release as the characters find isolated ways to interact. Quinn, with his limited dialogue and numerous silent scenes, exudes a sweet, sympathetic vulnerability that takes him to difficult places as a performer. Nyong’o, though she punctuates Sam with moments of abject terror, maintains a stern resolve, which comes with some deeply moving layers.</p>
<p id="mqqKEu">While there’s no hint of traditional Hollywood romance between Eric and Sam, <em>A Quiet Place:</em> <em>Day One</em> is deeply romantic in its depiction of two frightened souls caring for each other, with emotional and physical intimacy born from sheer instinct, as the world tips past a precipice we know it won’t return from. In the process, Sarnoski and his leads turn what could have easily been facile personal pursuits into the most important thing either character will ever do. </p>
<p id="oyOuqP"><small><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em></small><small> is in theaters now.</small></p>

This game, and <em>Final Fantasy</em> as a series, is often incredibly self-serious— it’s always about saving a world from a cosmic evil, which is pretty intense. <em>Dawntrail</em> seems determined to ignore all of that and give us a chance to vibe out with a drink and a fluffy alpaca on the beach. I deserve that. I mean my Warrior of Light deserves that. I can’t wait.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another franchise is heading for the remake machine as Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin’s Creed remakes are on the way. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio’s website</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemont says that the Assassin’s Creed series would see a number of games in the future, including remakes.</p>



<p>“Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we’ve created in the past and modernize them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin’s Creed games that are still extremely rich,” he said.</p>



<p>“Secondly, to answer your question, there will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin’s Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including Assassin’s Creed Hexe, which we’ve announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. </p>



<p>“We’re going to surprise people, I think.”</p>



<p>He didn’t confirm what remakes are coming, but Insider Gaming has reported on the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake in development. That game is under the codename Obsidian. On top of that, Insider Gaming has seen brief footage of Edward Kenway in the remake under the condition that it not be shared.</p>



<p>As far as the engine being used for the Assassin’s Creed remakes, it will be using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Anvil Pipeline” engine</a> that Insider Gaming first reported on back in March. This isn’t a completely new engine, but is a major evolution in what Ubisoft studios are able to do when developing the game and required substantial changes to the in-game animations, parkour, and more.</p>

Hardware-wise, this is the exact same SSD as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/bP0ve" target="_blank">2TB SK Hynix P41 Platinum</a> (Solidigm and SK Hynix are the same company) which means it is <strong>one of the fastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs on the market</strong>. This is an outstanding candidate for either your PlayStation 5 console or your gaming PC rig.</p><p><strong>Update: This deal is now expired</strong></p><h2>Solidigm P44 Pro 2TB M.2 SSD for $119.99</h2><p><em><strong>PS5 compatible</strong></em></p><div id="179680" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Solidigm P44 Pro 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7000Mbps)</h3></p></div><p>Solidigm is the US-based subsidiary of SK Hynix. SK Hynix might not be as recognizable as Samsung or Western Digital, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker and the world's third-largest semiconductor company. They supply components for brands like Corsair and G.Skill.</p><p>The Solidigm P44 Pro is based off the SK Hynix P41 Platinum, which is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read and write speeds of 7,000MB/sand 6,500MB/s. It also boasts random read and write speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and 1.3 million IOPS. In terms of reliability and stability, this SSD has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. Solidigm backs it all up with a 5 year warranty. Unlike most other SSDs, both the chips and the controller are manufactured in-house. The P44 Pro uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips. </p><p>Of course, in terms of real world performance, the vast majority of users won't be able to tell apart the speeds between the highest end PCI-E 4.0 SSDs. Other top-tier SSDs include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Z446D" target="_blank">Samsung 990 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/X641Y" target="_blank">WD Black SN850X</a>. It really just comes down to which one you can get the cheapest. At its current price point, the P44 Pro isn't just one of the fastest drives on the market, it's also cheaper than any competitor that can come close to its performance.</p><h3>A great PS5 SSD, but you'll need to get a heatsink</h3><p>The Solidigm P44 Pro does not come equipped with a heatsink. That's because this SSD is catered to PC gamers looking to add storage to their desktop computer. Many motherboards come equipped with built-in SSD coolers and will only accept bare SSDs. It's generally harder to remove a heatsink than to apply a new one. If you plan to use this for your PS5, we recommend you install your own heatsink for peace of mind. You can easily get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OGrjj" target="_blank">PS5 heatsink for under $10</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valentine's Day may have already passed, but love is still in the air in EA's latest expansion pack for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>. Titled Lovestruck, the new game expansion features a number of new ways for Sims to romance each other (and, of course, new items and clothing pieces to help set the mood).</p><p dir="ltr">Launching on July 25, Lovestruck introduces a new locale to The Sims 4: Ciudad Enamorada, a romantic in-game world with three distinct neighborhoods where Sims can buy (or build) homes, visit romantic bars and hotels, and experience the world's unique collection of special festivals and events. There's even a new lot trait called Singles Hangout that will attract Sims who haven't yet found their better half.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326023" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326023"></a><figcaption>The Lovestruck expansion pack includes a romantic new world called Ciudad Enamorada.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326015,1300-4326016,1300-4326017,1300-4326018,1300-4326019,1300-4326020,1300-4326021,1300-4326022" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Lovestruck adds a new app to each Sim's phone: Cupid's Corner, The Sims 4's version of Tinder. Sims can create their own Cupid's Corner profile and browse other Sims' profiles. Some Sims are looking for love, while others may not be so quick to commit.</p><p dir="ltr">A new "Create A Date" function will also be included in the Lovestruck expansion pack, allowing players to customize dates, decide which in-game goals they want to complete on said dates, and create the perfect night out (or in) for their love-seeking Sims. Lovestruck also deepens the complexity of Sims' relationships with a new system called Relationship Dynamics. Relationship Dynamics mean Sim romances can now be labeled as Wholesome, Steamy, Strained, or Unpredictable, which will naturally have some interesting in-game consequences.</p><p>The Sims 4 Lovestruck expansion pack will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for $40 USD</a> when it launches on July 25.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alpha-protocol">Alpha Protocol</a> disappeared from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-de-listed-from-steam">digital store shelves back in 2019 due to expiring music licenses</a>. Back in March, some four years later, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-espionage-rpg-alpha-protocol-returns-to-store-shelves-after-four-years-in-license-hell">returned via GOG</a>. Now it's once again also available via Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You'll find the spy RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34010/Alpha_Protocol/">over on Steam</a> at a 20% discount for the duration of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-2024-summer-sale-is-now-live">just-launched Steam summer sale</a>.
</p>
<p>I have to assume this Steam re-appearance is the same version that's also available on GOG, which included not only the return of the licensed music that prompted its disappearance in the first place, but also controller support, cloud saves and achievements. 
</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol was developed by Obsidian, who these days are owned by Microsoft, but Alpha Protocol itself is still home at original publisher Sega. Whether the 2010 action RPG is actually any good is a matter of some debate: Alice0 called it her favourite Obsidian game, but I've seen as many people argue that it's janky trash as that it's one of <em>those</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-average-action-games-on-pc">seven out of tens</a>. 
</p>
<p>I have no opinion of my own, having not played it, but I know it's a favourite of enough of you commenters that its appearance on Valve's storefront seemed worth acknowledging. Please start a vibrant but polite argument about its relative merits in the comments.</p>
