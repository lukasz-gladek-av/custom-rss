<p>Relic have confirmed that Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: ReDawned: War For All: Come Get Some War Down Ya: One Dawntillion Wardollars Edition will be compatible with "over 20 years of lovingly crafted community mods". Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: This Dawn, Its Warsenal Edition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">also comes bundled with all four expansions</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the full package contains four campaigns and nine factions, namely Orks, Eldar, Spicy Eldar, Space Marines, Spicy Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Tau, Necrons, and Sisters Of Battle. Tyranids were never released, but you have to remember this was 2004, and the idea of having a swarming species of hive-minded purple bug aliens in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> was ridiculous.</p>
<p>In terms of multiplayer, Relic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">say they've</a> been "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs", though balance will remain the same. They also plan to hang around for a bit after launch to fix "high priority issues", and experiment with with changes to things like flying unit behaviour, unit pathing, and "quality-of-life settings such as grid key presets".</p>
<p>As for general improvements, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of Phwoar, That's A Lot Of War(hammer) edition features: image-based lighting, unit texture upscaling ("at least four times their original resolution), new world lighting, unit reflections, surface gloss, emissive lighting, and new shadows. There's also an integrated mod manager, an "improved camera", better draw distances, 4K support, and a better HUD for widescreen.</p>
<p>There is apparently a very minor controversy going on over the new trailer (above) replacing a Space Marine's scream. The word 'iconic' has been used. This does not bother me, because everything that has ever come out of a Space Marine's mouth is stupid, and the setting would be vastly improved if you replaced it all with goat noises. Although, as an Ork enjoyer, I realise I'm throwing stones from the glassiest of houses here.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-gets-an-august-release-date-with-a-chunky-discount-for-anniversary-owners]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo and Universal Pictures have registered the copyright for a Donkey Kong film, suggesting the forthcoming Mario sequel and Legend of Zelda film could be followed by Nintendo's gorilla.</p>
<p>Few details are currently known, beyond the existence of the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">copyright itself</a>, but the news is in line with a response from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">investor call</a>.</p>
<p>Furukawa was asked about the future of the "visual content business" - films, essentially. The president replied the company has been "working on initiatives beyond our dedicated video game platforms for several years" and that it's "deeply involved in production".</p>

<p>He added: "Although we cannot discuss our plans beyond The Legend of Zelda movie at this time, we are working on various other projects."</p>
<p>It seems a Donkey Kong film will be the next project.</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong film would certainly make sense. To begin with, the gorilla is a prominent character in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, voiced by Seth Rogan, and will likely feature in the sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-super-mario-movie-title-quietly-announced-then-quickly-removed-by-nbcuniversal">expected to be called Super Mario World</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are the theme parks, which have expanded from just the Mario universe to include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releasing as a launch period game this week for Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say Nintendo is putting great emphasis on Donkey Kong at present, meaning it's understandable why a Donkey Kong film would be prioritised as the next project after Mario and Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Mario sequel film is set to release in April 2026</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">Zelda film was recently delayed to March 2027</a>. There's no indication as to when the Donkey Kong film will be released but, perhaps Spring 2028 if they're a year apart?</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed ahead of its release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza is being made by the Mario Odyssey development team</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza recently</a>, stating "it's clear to me that the Nintendo developers in Japan have paid an enormous amount of attention to the entirety of Donkey Kong's history - and the result is a Nintendo Japan game that has a rare energy".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues]]></content:encoded>

        <p>You suddenly wake up in an unfamiliar room. You step through a door only to find yourself in yet another strange room. This mysterious space is a collection of interconnected rooms, coming one after the other with no exit in sight.</p><p>What’s worse, you’ve lost your memories. Inside the rooms, you run into other girls who also have no idea who they are or how they got here. But as you keep exploring, you realize something: these rooms are built from your memories. Yours and the other girls’.</p><p>Who are you?<br>Why are you here?<br>And how can you escape this seemingly endless collection of rooms?</p><p><strong>Restore Memories by Placing Items</strong></p><p>As you explore, you’ll find various items. Place them in specific spots to trigger memories associated with a specific combination of items and locations.</p><p>For example, placing a knife in a kitchen might bring back memories of <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>… but that same knife, placed in another room, could remind you of something entirely different.</p><p>However, not all the memories you’ll find will be your own. Some may belong to the other people trapped in this strange space. Sort through the memories, find out whom they belong to, and the truth will finally come into focus.</p><p><strong>A Shifting Space, Changing Every Time You Wake up</strong></p><p>Every time you fall asleep and wake up, you’ll find that the layout of the rooms, how they connect, and the items you find in them all change.</p><p>You can explore, find items, and uncover memories how many times you like, but remember: no two attemps will be the same.</p><p><strong>The More You Do, the Sleepier You Get</strong></p><p>Each <a title="Genres > Action [2,871 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> you take adds to your Sleepiness gauge. Once the gauge is full, you’ll fall asleep… and who knows where you’ll wake up.</p><p>You’ll also lose the items you were carrying, so you’ll need to carefully plan your every step, from the rooms you explore to the items you place in them.</p><p><strong>Meet the Others Trapped Within</strong></p><p>Just like you, the girls inside this space have lost their memories. As you find out more about them, they’ll surely repay the favor by giving you hints.</p><p>The real question is… should you trust them?</p><p>Everyone here has their own forgotten past and their own secrets. Uncovering those may be the key to learning the truth.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li>Published by: KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO</li><li>Scenario and Programming: Kazuhide Oka</li><li>3DCG and Art: Moe Katakura</li><li>Music: agehasprings <a title="Genres > Party [99 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a></li><li>Logo Design: JEFF99</li><li>English Translation: Marco Godano</li><li>Simplified / Traditional Chinese Translation: flankoi</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/kamitsubaki-studio-and-kazuhide-oka-announce-psychological-space-exploration-adventure-game-platonica-space-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>8BitDo has partnered with Xbox on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new edition of its Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller</a>. Unlike the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DLFVGYJP,B0DK37CSHP,B0DK36N98Q,B0F5WRZ3LJ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original model</a> that 8BitDo debuted last holiday season, the Xbox-licensed model supports iPhone. We'll be testing the revised model in the coming weeks and will update this article with our impressions, but it has the same features as the Android-only original--and that controller is great.</p><p>Like all 8BitDo controllers, the Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth carries a budget-friendly price: $50. But even from a manufacturer known for offering customizable pro-style controllers with high-end performance at low prices, the $50 price is a bit surprising. 8BitDo's other collaborations with Xbox--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DMTLLSBN,B0DMVLD2HC,B0F18T675W,B0D1VHH4C5,B0D1VHT3S6,B0F9L7Q3VG,B0F9L7L7CJ,B0929K9W4N,B0F7RMB4RH,B0CH4SFPSW,B0C4YKQ7ZF,B0CNPST9GY,B0D7P5M1Q3,B0CSPFFVRT,B0CX52RYR4,B0CX4YP82L,B0D3HJ8T3C,B0D1TV3HGB,B0D3HHZK8D,B0D1T96W4L,B0D1TDYNPS,B0CYZKNSS1,B0CYZH52ZY,B0DNZB28FR,B0DNQBQNG7,B0DNZD53VF,B0DNQ9FXJW,B0DNZFCJ5S,B0DNQD9HPS,B0BXSV78R6,B09B2R2GRM,B0CMH7DR3Y,B0D5LPJ2NN,B0BGPX25FP,B0BGPTPSCM,B0BGPQSCMM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Series X|S controllers, arcade sticks, a keyboard and matching mouse</a>--generally cost a bit more than comparable versions without the Xbox license. But the $50 price here matches the cost of the Android version, and the new one supports iPhone <em>and </em>Android.

It's available in two colors, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a>. Both models have black sticks, face buttons with the standard Xbox color scheme, and the retro-style D-pad found on most 8BitDo controller. It has tactile handles that are contoured to look and feel quite similar to a console/PC controller.</p><p>The Ultimate's numerous premium components and features make it a serious competitor to mobile controllers that retail for double the price (or more). It has two remappable back buttons that will feel familiar to those who have used one of 8BitDo's Ultimate Controllers for PC or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>The full-sized thumbsticks utilize Hall Effect sensors, which offer a smoother feel and are generally more durable than conventional analog sticks because you don't have to worry about stick drift. The right and left triggers are activated via Hall Effect sensors as well. With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2, you can remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and create up to three custom profiles.</p><p>The stretchable bridge is large enough to fit all iPhone models and most Android phones. As long as your device is within the range of 100-170mm (3.93-6.69in) in length, you're good to go. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest edition so far, is 6.42 inches.</p><p>The phone cradle offers a secure fit thanks to a few design features. It has a rubberized back and tabs on each side to grip your phone while also preventing scratches. The back sheet of rubber is dotted with a series of button symbols that create a textured feel. Additionally, the bottom corners jut out slightly from the handles for extra support.</p><p>Since it connects wirelessly to your device via Bluetooth, you can also use it with Android tablets, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even the Apple Vision Pro. 8BitDo says the 300mAh battery offers up to 13 hours on a full charge (1.5 hours to recharge).</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller for iOS &amp; Android (White)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50 | Officially licensed by Xbox</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Here's a quick rundown of the specs, which are virtually identical to its predecessor.

Made in collaboration with XR glasses manufacturer Viture, the translucent black <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Controller with USB-C</a> is only compatible with Android and costs $79. An iPhone version of the Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate is in the works and is expected to release this year. You don't need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture XR Glasses</a> to use the USB-C version, but we'd recommend checking out the XR glasses regardless because the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/viture-pro-xr-glasses-prime-day-deal-save-big-on-wearable-135-inch-display/1100-6529930/" data-ref-id="1100-6529930">wearable display tech</a> is immensely impressive.</p><h2>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller vs. the competition for iPhone</h2><p>The Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller is half the <i>regular </i>price of the popular Backbone One. Regular is in italics because <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CCT2TJW4,B0CCT2LWT8,B0CT17GPNT,B0CT1BRLZ9,B0DQM23MLZ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has the Backbone One 2nd Gen for $70 (was $100)</a></strong> and the 1st Gen models for $60 right now. From a build perspective, I preferred the original 8BitDo Mobile Controller for Android over the Backbone One. That said, Backbone's app is also a pretty awesome console-like launcher, whereas 8BitDo's Ultimate Software is just for control configuration. The Backbone connects to your phone's USB-C or Lightning port, which is typically better than Bluetooth in terms of input response times--though many people won't notice the difference. The Backbone One doesn't have back buttons or full-sized sticks; for those features, you have to make the jump to the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone Pro</a>.

Just last month, the popular manufacturer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razers-kishi-v3-pro-xl-controller-turns-your-ipad-pro-into-a-giant-handheld/1100-6532399/" data-ref-id="1100-6532399">released the Kishi V3 series</a> with three different models starting at $100. Only the $100 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F233Y5YL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 base model</a> is comparable to the 8BitDo Ultimate or Backbone, but it's a rather impressive option thanks to TMR electromagnetic sticks, remappable back buttons, and a premium build. The $150 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 Pro</a> also works on iPhone and Android phones as well as 8-inch tablets. It has extra features such as remappable claw bumpers and Razer's mecha-tactile, mouse-like button.

It connects to iPhone 15/16 and small tablets like the iPad Mini via USB-C. This model doesn't have back buttons, but it does have Hall Effect sticks. GameSir also has its own app called GameHub with a launcher UI similar to Backbone.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is perhaps the most beloved intro cinematic in Warhammer 40,000 video game history, a precious relic of a bygone era that is seared into the memories of fans of Games Workshop’s grimdark setting. And woe betide anyone who dares to change it, lest the wrath of all four Chaos gods descend upon them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s how I imagine the developers at Relic Entertainment felt after releasing a high quality version of <a href="https://youtu.be/_oqr06cHAGw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn of War’s iconic intro cinematic</a> to accompany the announcement of the August 14 release date of the Definitive Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, below, reveals the insertion of dialogue from the 2004 Dawn of War real-time strategy game into its intro cinematic, replacing some of the original audio along the way. Chief among the changes is the removal of an “iconic” (at least, for Warhammer 40,000 fans!) guttural scream bellowed by the Space Marine who leads the forces of the Blood Ravens to battle against the monstrous Orks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its stead is the battlecry of Gabriel Angelos, Chapter Master of the Blood Ravens, as it is heard in Dawn of War gameplay. The thing is, that’s not even Gabriel Angelos screaming in the trailer. It’s a Blood Raven sergeant. And, Dawn of War fans say, the new dialogue compares poorly to the heroic scream it replaced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. Those with keen hearing and an even keener memory will notice other audio changes. The Dreadnought’s dramatic entrance is “ruined,” some say, by the addition of voice lines that distract from the heart-pumping sound of its Assault Cannon revving up and unleashing on the enemy lines. New Ork lines are inserted, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“THEY'VE RUINED IT! THEY REMOVED THE SERGEANT'S HOLY SCREAM!” declared one Emperor-living fanatic in the YouTube comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original sound effects were PERFECT.  You didn't need to add all those voices. I'll be honest, they kind of ruined it,” said another devotee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Makes it feel less well done and not as cohesive. They just seemed so out of place and you can tell they're just shoved on top.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The new audio is awful. Really takes me out of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Leaving the sergeant's scream out is a crime against humanity, and therefore heresy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mind fixing the cinematic by restoring the original audio? The new stuff spliced in doesn't work at all and it kinda ruins the nostalgia for us. Hopefully it can be reverted by launch,” said another, perhaps more considered worshipper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps that’s exactly what Relic will do. I asked the developer for comment on this online complaint barrage, and its response suggested the whole thing has taken the studio by surprise.</p><blockquote>“We decided to change the scream as the original audio was quite distorted which was notable when compared to some of the audio touch ups in the enhanced trailer. That said, we’ve heard the feedback from fans — the roar was even more beloved than we realized! Who knows, we may have something for OG roar enjoyers before long.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it sounds like Relic has a solution up its sleeve, which will hopefully go some way to placating the wrath of Warhammer 40,000’s passionate fanbase. I realize, however, that for the uninitiated, all this fuss may sound like an overreaction. All we're talking about here are a few audio changes, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s something unmistakingly gritty about the original intro trailer’s look, feel, and, yes, old-school audio. It reminds fans of a time in PC gaming’s history when RTS ruled the roost, the Astra Militarum were called the Imperial Guard, and Warhammer 40,000 superfan Henry Cavill had just finished filming Hellraiser: Hellworld. The original rekindles memories of hazy summer days spent hammering out Heretics, my flatmate desperately trying to outmaneuver my attacks. This new and “improved” intro cinematic is too clean, too… nice, and it will always be too recent.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is to say Relic’s Dawn of War Definitive Edition is on a hiding to nothing. I’m genuinely excited to play it, and not just for a short-lived trip down memory lane. It’s a fantastic game — perhaps the greatest Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made — and I look forward to hammering out those Heretics all over again. Perhaps I’ll even convince my old flatmate to join me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the trailer! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-interview-i-am-going-back-and-fixing-typos-i-made-20-years-ago">I interviewed design director Philippe Boulle back in May when the Definitive Edition was announced</a>, and we gushed over Dawn of War’s intro cinematic. Here’s why it’s so good, according to Boulle:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was an amazing accomplishment at the time in terms of the fidelity. We really hadn't seen that for 40K at that time, and it really stood up as something that would reach out and grab you and say, ‘Hey, this is awesome. You need to pay attention.’ And it will still be in the game. It will be playing in beautiful 4K.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The thing that amazes me about it when we look back at it is the directing really holds up. That I think is the undervalued key to it. For the time the rendering was phenomenal, but what really holds up is the pacing, the drama, the ending on this guy running up the hill and getting shot, planting that flag and the drop pods coming down… that just works and that didn't need any changing obviously. That just was like, ‘Oh yeah, that's the stuff.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fun fact! Dave Wilson, executive producer and supervising director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40000-secret-level-animation-is-a-sequel-to-space-marine-2">the excellent Warhammer 40,000 episode of Prime Video’s Secret Level animated anthology series</a>, led the creation of the Dawn of War intro cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>According to a new copyright listing</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong - Mario Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a39b4952f817/donkey-kong-mario-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the monumental success of <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, it seems Nintendo and Universal are keen to expand on its new venture beyond the upcoming sequel in 2026.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-and-universal-pictures-seemingly-pursuing-donkey-kong-movie/">Nintendo Everything</a>, a <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">new copyright filing</a> has been spotted that is simply listed as <strong>'Untitled Donkey Kong Project ;Motion picture'</strong>. The date of recordation is 6th June 2025, with two dates listed as the execution: 9th May and 17th May 2025.</p>
<p>Now, are we absolutely sure that this relates to a new movie starring Donkey Kong? No. But given that it's listed as a 'motion picture' and it's from both Nintendo and Universal leads us to believe that maybe a spin-off starring DK is in very early pre-production (or if not pre-production, then early discussions, at least).</p>
<figure><a title="DK Movie - Copyright" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/671a601aee3cc/dk-movie-copyright.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">Public Records</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo currently has two movie projects officially in the works. The first is a direct sequel to the Mario Movie – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/super-mario-world-looks-to-be-the-official-name-of-the-next-mario-movie">rumoured to be titled 'Super Mario World'</a> – scheduled for release on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>. The second is a Legend of Zelda live-action movie scheduled for release on <strong>7th May 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>It's likely, then, that if a Donkey Kong movie is indeed in the works, then we probably won't be seeing it for a few years yet. Chances are, however, that Nintendo will be keen to retain the voice talent from the Mario Movie. Seth Rogan voiced DK himself and Fred Armisen voicing Cranky Kong.</p>
<p>It looks like we're seeing the start of a 'Mario Cinematic Universe', folks – or 'MCU' for short. We're certain that won't cause any confusion... Maybe 'Nintendo Cinematic Universe' is better.</p>

<p>A Switch 2 user claims they've got the game early</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/50710-donkey-kong-bananza-s-street-date-has-been-broken">highlighted by GoNintendo</a>, a user on the Nintendo Switch subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mark7z/">known as 'Mark7z'</a> has supposedly acquired a copy of DK's anticipated release early.</p>
<p>Attached to the user's post are photos of the box art and game card, and in follow-up comments are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lye5oy/comment/n2u21im/?context=3">some photos of the game's home menu icon</a>, as well as photos of the game in what's claimed to be a "playable" state.</p>

<p>The same individual says they didn't get it from a store, but instead through their "connection" and goes on to mention how the title is currently running on Version 1.0.0 – with an update, apparently, ready to go. They add that they <em>won't</em> be installing this update until release day.</p>
<p>Some replies to this post also raised some concerns about the type of game card included, and the user responded, stating it's not a "game-key card" but an "actual" game card.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8kzripm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, street dates being broken on major first-party Nintendo titles (along with leaks) was quite common during the Switch generation. So, this might not go down well at Nintendo headquarters, seeing as how the official release for DK's new outing isn't until <strong>17th July 2025</strong>, and this is the first major game to follow the system's launch and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:185143 @ 1752483422 -->
<p>If we hear any significant updates or more cases of this game being accessed by other Switch 2 users ahead of its launch, we'll let you know. At the very least, consider this a warning that story-related leaks (or more) could potentially start circulating online in the coming days.</p></section>

            <p>Ken Levine has revealed his upcoming game, Judas, will be an "old-school" and "traditional" single-player adventure.</p>
<p>It's been 11 years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, and on the surface, Judas seems to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> game in all but name, with gunplay and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And while that is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">essentially what trailers</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">shown us of the game so far</a>, Levine has now confirmed that his upcoming game will indeed feel "old-school" given its focus not on live service or online play, but "telling the story and transporting the player".</p>

<p>"I grew up playing single-player games," Levine said. "And I grew up before [...] certain types of monetisation existed. I'm not here at all to say this is bad, or this is good, right? That's not really my thing. I know the kinds of games I like to make, and so we never made a game... like, Juas is a very old-school game," Levine told Nightdive's Lawrence Sonntag in a recent interview (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/bioshock-creator-says-audiences-reward-single-player-games-that-dont-have-other-methods-of-monetization-like-baldurs-gate-3-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">GR+</a>).</p>
<p>"You buy the game and you get the whole thing. There's no online component. There's no live service, because everything we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player somewhere.</p>
<p>"We're very fortunate. This is no diss on any developers who have done that, because look, games are expensive to make, and we're very fortunate to work at a company where they believe in us enough that they say, 'Okay, you've been working on this thing for a long time, it's gonna cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not gonna push any of that stuff on you.'"</p>

If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has Nintendo Switch copies available for only $34.99. In my opinion, the Switch has to be the definitive way to experience this classic, and now is the perfect time to catch up before Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake this Fall.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save Big on Samsung Gaming Monitors</h2></div><div id="224045" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="10b6cd8c-a865-48f5-bfb6-27093bf89254"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 32” Odyssey QD-OLED G8 (G80SD) Series 4K UHD Smart Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><div catalogid="10b6cd8c-a865-48f5-bfb6-27093bf89254" id="224046"><div id="224046" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD) Series OLED Curved Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot has two excellent Samsung gaming monitors on sale this weekend, and you can save up to $900!

This monitor is best for the richest visuals, as the OLED technology allows for true blacks. On the other hand, the Samsung G9 49" Curved OLED Gaming Monitor is a beast that will instantly transform any setup.

Arkham Knight notoriously ran poorly on the Switch, but the Switch 2 has ironed out most of these issues seemingly thanks to its increased power. For $29.83, you can pick up the trilogy for under $10 a game, which is a pretty great deal considering this was a $60 release. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza Out This Week</h2></div><div catalogid="3cd545c5-1d5f-4eb7-be84-a6f92ed62e6d" id="222943"><div id="222943" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza - Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is out this week, so now is the time to lock in your copy.

If you don't have interest in the Apple Watch Ultra, this model will bring most of its features for just a third of the price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> developer Unknown Worlds' parent company, Krafton, has issued another statement, this time confirming that an internal milestone document leaked online is authentic.</p>
<p>As Matt explained for us last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original Subnautica director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>

<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026.</p>
<p>It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>Then, just ahead of the weekend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">pages from an internal review document</a> also popped up online. According to the leaker, it "clearly shows the state of the development progress and why Krafton and the Subnautica team disagreed on the release schedules".</p>
<p>The document purports to show where the development of Subnautica 2 was deemed to be versus expectation at this point in the development cycle. It criticises the as-is position, saying "while the game includes a variety of content, it currently lacks the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and "falls short of meeting the high expectations of the OWSC and the Asian market". It also clearly states it expects a "content volume increase of over 30 percent compared to v1.0".</p>
<p>At the bottom of the second slide, the author - which remains unknown - states: "compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications, the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap".</p>
<p>Rather than refute the leak, however, Krafton has confirmed the document is real, saying it was approving the credibility of the report because that would "minimi[se] speculation and ensur[e] accurate communication with players".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">A leak from a credible source regarding the milestone review of Subnautica 2</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Complete_Bread_4924/">u/Complete_Bread_4924</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/">Subnautica_2</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>"Krafton is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2," Krafton said in a statement to Eurogamer. "This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. Krafton has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. Krafton recognises the confusion this has caused.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document," the publisher added. "Krafton believes that minimising speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence.</p>
<p>"Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with Krafton's creative studios across all projects. These reviews help assess development progress, define clear objectives, and ensure that each project aligns with Krafton's standards in both creativity and quality. This process is central to Krafton's commitment to delivering polished, high-quality games at the right time.</p>
<p>The statement closed with Krafton's claim that it will "continue working closely with Unknown Worlds to ensure that Subnautica 2 meets the expectations of players who have supported the franchise over the years."</p>
<p>There has, as yet, been no formal response from the former leadership team.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gearbox is about to launch Borderlands 4, a new installment in its most lucrative franchise by far. It's been six years since Borderlands 3, although there were the spin-offs fantasy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and the forgettable adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/new-tales-from-the-borderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Tales from the Borderlands</a>, both released in 2021, in between.</p>



<p>Let's recap everything we have learned about the game from the developers since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/">unveiling</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions<br></h2>



<p>In February, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Borderlands 4 would debut on September 23. However, in late April, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it forward to September 12</a>. At the time, most believed that publisher Take-Two Interactive had dictated the move due to the imminent launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, then still scheduled for Fall 2025. However, Gearbox president Randy Pitchford was quick to state that the date change <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-denies-rumor-that-borderlands-4-launching-early-has-to-do-with-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had nothing to do with GTA VI</a>, and he was proven right mere days later, when Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> GTA VI's delay to May 26, 2026. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2, although users of the latter platform will have to wait a bit more to play the game. Unlike most games nowadays, there won't be any 'early access' for those wishing to purchase more expensive editions. However, said editions do come with many perks.</p>



<p>The Standard edition is priced at $69.99. The Deluxe Edition costs $99.99 and includes the <strong>Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin</strong> and the <strong>Bounty Pack Bundle</strong>, which consists of the following post-launch Borderlands 4 content:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 unique areas, featuring new missions and unique bosses</li>



<li>4 Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>4 New vehicles with new cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>The Super Deluxe Edition is priced at $129.99 and adds the following to the above:</p>



<p><strong>Ornate Order Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>4 Vault Hunter Skins</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Heads</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Bodies</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vault Hunter Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>2 new playable Vault Hunters</li>



<li>2 new Story Packs, featuring all new story and side missions</li>



<li>2 new map regions</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>New ECHO-4 cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>All editions of Borderlands 4, if pre-ordered, will provide access to the <strong>Gilded Glory Pack bundle</strong>, which consists of 1 Vault Hunter Skin, 1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin, and 1 Weapon Skin.</p>

<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>The franchise can be considered the original looter shooter, and this new installment will be no exception. </p>



<p>However, the setting is different from the previous titles. Long gone is the planet Pandora, which had been the focus of every game in the series except for New Tales from the Borderlands. This new entry follows directly from the ending of Borderlands 3, where Lilith uses her Siren powers to teleport the moon Elpis away (saving Pandora in the process). An unintended consequence is that Elpis's arrival in the orbit of the planet Kairos destroys the planet's protective barrier, making it visible to everyone after a very long time of staying hidden.</p>



<p>Kairos is a planet ruled through fear and oppression by a dictator named The Timekeeper. However, the uncloaking caused by the moon Elpis sparked chaos and uprisings. Players take the role of a Vault Hunter who ends up leading the resistance against The Timekeeper while, of course, seeking various alien artifacts. Borderlands 4 is also going to shift the series' trademark humor a bit. It will still be there, mostly in side content, but the main storyline will be a bit more serious than fans are used to due to the dictatorship theme.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, the game will focus heavily on shooting and looting. However, the new installment offers several enhancements. To start with, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-more-vertical-and-lets-you-go-anywhere-and-thats-why-it-doesnt-have-a-minimap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the map is the biggest and most seamless in the franchise, allowing players to explore freely. There's a lot more verticality, too, which players will be able to exploit thanks to climbing, the grappling hook, and gliding. Other movement options include dashing, sliding, and double jumping. </p>



<p>Because of the exploration changes, the developers have opted to use a Bethesda-style compass rather than the mini-map seen in previous Borderlands games. They did not completely close the door to adding the feature post-launch if the fans really want it, though. Exploring Kairos will be spiced up by dynamic weather and events. Furthermore, players will be able to command their own vehicle to reach further destinations more quickly.</p>



<p>In terms of combat changes, Borderlands 4 introduces a new ordnance slot, which groups together grenades and heavy weaponry, including rocket launchers. These weapons can be fired or thrown until the ammo is depleted. Then, they possess cooldown timers that refill the ammo and the ability to activate again over a short timeframe. There are also new repair kits that can regenerate health or provide other benefits, such as increased elemental damage, fire rate, and movement speed.</p>



<p>At launch, Borderlands 4 will offer four playable characters to choose from:</p>



<p><strong>Vex the Siren</strong> - She had a hard life, fending for herself for her entire life. This perhaps explains her cynical and sarcastic nature, but beneath her rough exterior and general pessimism, she still believes in helping others. If helping means blasting oppressive jerks, all the better.</p>



<p><strong>Rafa the Exo-Soldier</strong> - He was born and raised in microgravity, which altered his bone density and musculature so severely that he could not survive anywhere else. However, Rafa was desperate to explore and enlisted in Tediore's military. In exchange for a tour of duty, his body was modified to fit a new exosuit. However, when it became clear that Tediore never intended to release him from service, he went on the run, planning to enjoy whatever time he has left before his Tediore Deadframe ends him for good.</p>



<p><strong>Harlowe the Gravitar</strong> - A former Maliwan combat scientist, she is driven by the need to understand how things work. This initially made her an outcast among her Traunt relatives, but she has used her intellect to bring new technology and gadgets to the battlefield as a Vault Hunter. Her brilliance is evident in everything she does, as is her enthusiasm and love for life.</p>



<p><strong>Amon the Forgeknight</strong> - He was raised in a Vault monster-worshipping cult until the Vault opened and the creature turned on everyone he loved. The only survivor of the ensuing carnage, he dedicates his life to finding and killing as many of these beasts as he possibly can. At heart, Amon is a warrior-poet who is introspective and unflinching in his duty. Despite his rugged appearance, he has a warm attitude and often shares stories and advice from his travels with his comrades.</p>



<p>At least two additional playable characters will be introduced to Borderlands 4 at some point after launch. As with previous franchise entries, the game will support cooperative gameplay for up to four players, this time with cross-play between all platforms.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Borderlands-4-characters-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. Gearbox has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassured</a> fans that the Nintendo Switch 2 is powerful enough to run the game well.</p>



<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official PC system requirements</a> aren't the most taxing we've seen for an Unreal Engine 5 game:</p>



<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br><em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br><em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p>So far, Gearbox hasn't officially partnered with AMD or NVIDIA for Borderlands 4, but that may change before launch. If it does, we'll update this article.</p>
