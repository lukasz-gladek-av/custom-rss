</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I spawned on a moon base in <em>Arma 3</em>. My role was a rifleman, and I held some extra ammo for the rest of my squad. I put on my armor, which had “PRESS” written in white across the chest piece. Outside the base’s walls was the surface of a moon, which had a thin atmosphere and low gravity. I wasn’t going to be able to hear gunshots or footsteps while outside.</p><p>After being slowed down by technical issues, we were briefed on the mission. Stellarynn, my squad leader and the founder of the 1st Selkie Platoon, asked everyone to open their maps, and we took a look at our objectives. We were to advance on a base occupied by pirates and find a server room. Once there, we would find a way to connect servers to a huge railgun to target the orbiting pirates’ ship. We’d then get to the railgun, bait the pirates into attacking us, turn it on, and blow up their ship.</p><p>“We will convert haters to craters,” Stella said.</p><p>We formed up and got ready to move out.</p><p>I’ve always loved military simulation video games. There’s something uniquely special about strategizing, navigating the realistic mechanics, and working as a team, all with your heart pumping because one well-placed enemy bullet could knock you out of the game and ruin your plans.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Arma 3</em> might be the best game to seek that thrill, but it comes with challenges too. Milsim games can be overwhelmingly masculine. When I play public servers in the modern combat milsim<em> </em><a href="https://www.joinsquad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squad</em></a>, I have to grit my teeth and bear racial and anti-LGBTQ+ slurs. While I feel discomfort and annoyance in these games as a cis, white bisexual man, other players have to act or speak certain ways, or not speak at all, to avoid harassment or worse.&nbsp;</p><p>So upon receiving an invite from Stella to play with the 1st Selkie Platoon, her trans women-only unit, I was excited to not only meet them, but to learn how they navigated a game dominated by cisgender men.&nbsp;</p><p>Stella told me that she doesn’t play <em>Squad </em>and that, when she plays public servers in milsims, she stays quiet.</p><p>“I avoid using microphones in [other milsim games],” she said. “I’ve got friends who have played <em>Squad</em> and do use the microphone and all that, and some of them have absolutely had various forms of bigotry leveled their way.”</p><p>The milsim community – and gaming in general – struggles with something Stella calls “assumed maleness.” It’s the idea that another player is a cis male by default until that player asserts otherwise. The key is “asserts” – other players won’t always click your profile and see your pronouns, she said.</p><p>“Even when I’ve got my profile picture that is a picture of my face with long hair, bangs, and makeup on, I will still get ‘he/him’s in a conversation unless pronouns are in my username,” Stella said.</p><p>For the 1st Selkie Platoon, that idea is “flipped,” she said; everybody in the Discord server is assumed to be a woman by default. This helps trans women who might not feel comfortable talking because they have a deep voice feel safer doing so.</p><p>“There’s a lot of girls who basically have said [that] they’ve never really spoken in any kind of voice channels before because they don’t feel comfortable anywhere else,” Stella said. “But this space was an exception.”</p><h2><strong>"Everybody in this server is like, 'I deserve respect</strong>'"</h2><p>Before the Selkies, Stella was in another unit where it was hers, she said, “in all but name,” run by someone else who was more of a “figurehead” and was “being rude to some of the people” and driving them away.</p><p>So Stella decided to make her own unit, which came together last January. The Selkies use a more casual structure than some other units. Before a mission, players choose roles in different squads. Squad leaders are determined from a de facto list of people who like to lead, but others are encouraged to step outside of their comfort zone.</p><p>“Because we aren’t very strict, we tend to encourage people to try new things,” she said. “Some days, somebody’s had a long day at work [and] doesn’t want to [lead], so we’ll kind of swap the team structure a little bit.”</p><p>Tuesdays are when the group plays their operations, which bring in the most players. Operations are similar to one-shots in tabletop roleplaying games: usually scripted missions developed by a player, with someone — usually the mission maker — as the “game master” called Zeus. Some units have multiple mission makers, but the Selkies have just Stella, who makes the mission, takes command, and acts as&nbsp; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275700/Arma_3_Zeus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zeus</a>.</p><p>Though Stella makes the missions, other members have contributed through modding. The 1st Selkie Platoon has an overarching story in an alternate timeline diverging at the end of <em>Halo 3</em>, so those additional mods help enhance the experience.</p><p>“We’ve got custom lore, and we’re fighting against enemies that are like our own custom version of these groups where it’s all kind of coming together to tell that story,” Stella said. “People are matching the amount of effort that I’m putting in, which is awesome to see.”</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>There isn’t a vetting process to join the Selkies, but Stella said she and two other moderators conduct a “vibe check” when they speak to someone who’s interested. Usually, Stella finds interested players on sites like Tumblr and talks to them for a little bit before extending an invite. That’s enough to keep any bad actors from getting in so far, she said.</p><p>And if they do get in, they’re joining a server “full of very outspoken trans women,” she said.</p><p>“Everybody in this server is like, ‘I deserve respect and I will fight for respect, and if I’m not respected, I will end communication with people,’” Stella said. “Everybody in that server deserves to take up as much space as somebody who is not a trans woman. That is just a fact of life. We deserve the same respect as any other person, and if somebody’s going to disagree with that, they’re going to find that they’re disagreed with very often.”</p><p>The Selkies provide more than just <em>Arma 3 </em>operations. They have roles in their Discord for other games, and Friday nights are a non-<em>Arma</em> game night. Stella’s vision is for the 1st Selkie Platoon to be a casual space like any other.</p><p>That the space is casual is important to her, because queer spaces can sometimes open “a floodgate” of repressed sexuality that can finally be expressed, Stella said. The Discord keeps NSFW jokes and comments to “an absolute minimum within reason” to keep everyone comfortable.</p><p>“There are people who are not necessarily comfortable with that, and we don’t want anybody feeling like she can’t speak up because the conversation will get derailed into people being horny again,” she said. “It means that people can feel comfortable just forming friendships and there’s no pressure.”</p><p>Those rules have worked “wonderfully,” she said. Conversations are kept civil — even in the Discord’s politics channel.</p><p>The unit is growing, too. When I spoke first to Stella in July, she said about 15 people come to their big operations. Now, the number is closer to 20-25, and the Discord just hit 70 members.</p><p>Stella feels like with every mission, she is “perpetually underestimating” how many people will show. But seeing the growth, she said, is “fantastic.”</p><p>“I keep low-balling myself,” she said. “Then everybody’s standing in front of me, and [I’m] like, ‘Wow.’”</p><h2><strong>Getting briefed</strong></h2><p>To accept Stella’s invitation to join the operation, I had to set up a slew of mods to join the server, ranging from one called <a href="https://ace3.acemod.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACE</a>, which makes the game even <em>more </em>realistic through wound management and absurdly accurate ballistics. To communicate with my squad, I installed TaskForce Radio, a mod that accurately replicates radios and adds higher-quality proximity chat with the help of <a href="https://www.teamspeak.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TeamSpeak</a> (yes, it’s still around!). The Selkies don’t play the default near-future modern military gear; they run milsims in the world of <em>Halo</em> using an overhaul called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769440155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Trebuchet</a>. Players cannot change their character’s gender to female in the game, so some use a mod called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2021778690&amp;searchtext=Timberwolf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Task Force TimberWolf Female Characters</a> for female heads.</p><p>I wasn’t the only one newcomer to this op. Joining me was a player who goes by Myra, a new member of the Selkies who was attending eir first op.</p><p>The 24-year-old was first introduced to <em>Halo 2</em> by eir “nerdy parents” when e was 5, Myra told me. Myra bought <em>Arma 2</em> after watching the YouTube channel FRANKIEonPC play it nearly 13 years ago. But Myra only played solo and casual multiplayer, and e didn’t start to explore unit-based multiplayer options until <em>Arma 3</em> in 2019.</p><p>“<em>Arma</em> has permanently earned a soft spot in my heart,” Myra said.</p><p>Myra played online with cis men before coming out, but throughout this time was testing eir gender by dressing as more female presenting. It was a feeling Myra had felt since middle school, but e didn’t come out until last year.</p><p>“It was definitely hard to want to come out,” Myra said. “I was comfortable with the mediocrity of not having things change, though the change would be really good for me.”</p><p>In another squad was Aurelia. Aurelia first got interested in military roleplaying through a <em>Mass Effect </em>RP server in <em>Garry’s Mod</em>. She came out in 2018, and made her way to <em>Arma</em> around 7 years ago, where she continued her roleplaying interest in the 81st Arachnids, a <em>Halo</em> unit. That unit started as a bunch of friends, but it began to expand and needed someone to help manage the community. That’s where Aurelia came in – and where she was accepted as a woman by a community for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>“[They gave] me a place to be a part of the community — to be such a ‘pillar,’ as they have said to me,” she said.</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>The 81st Arachnids was retired not long after Aurelia joined. But Aurelia, along with her friends Red and Blue, created a new unit called the 137th Wolf Pack Battalion. Roleplay became even heavier, with operations weaving in storylines from different characters that players inhabited. While the 81st Arachnids was accepting, 137th Wolf Pack Battalion was made with the intent to be queer-friendly.</p><p>The 81st Arachnids helped Aurelia feel safe and comfortable, even though the outside world wasn’t as accepting.</p><p>“ I was kind of stuck in college and [had] parents that were not even remotely supportive,” she said. “I had a really hard time in my IRL life coming out [and] socially transitioning.”</p><p>Joining the op was a woman who wasn’t a regular member of the Selkies, May. The 20-year-old is in her own group made up of trans women called Purple Team, one of the very few units who not only play as Spartans from <em>Halo</em>, but to roleplay as them — like a specialized acting troupe. Other <em>Halo</em> units ask a Spartan unit like Purple Team to join their ops to provide an authentic Spartan experience to members of a unit.</p><p>Though she now is embedded within the Operation Trebuchet community, May joined her first <em>Halo</em> unit in 2020 when she was 16 years old. She began to experiment with her gender identity six months later, and hopped from unit to unit. <em>Arma 3</em> provided May with the opportunity to use her strengths in organization. She refers to herself as a “paper jockey” — she likes writing documentation like new player handbooks and training manuals.</p><p>“It’s one of the few games I feel like I can play endlessly and not get tired,” May said. “[<em>Arma 3</em>] is by far what I put the most amount of time and effort into, and enjoy the most doing.”</p><h2>"You can kind of tell this isn’t quite a safe space"</h2><p>Six months after May joined her first unit, she wore eyeliner in her Discord profile picture and changed her pronouns to they/them. The change caught the attention of one of the members. May recalled that member, a regular, saying that she “used too much” eyeliner and was getting “really aggressive.”</p><p>“Pretty much any time I spoke, he would tell me to get the fuck out,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>The member’s harassment made May feel some doubt about her gender identity, she said. She felt like she couldn’t leave the unit easily because it was the first one she joined, but a couple months later, she finally left.&nbsp;</p><p>After she left, an adult member of the unit reached out to her. May said the member encouraged her transition, but that after she turned 17, he joined her new unit, groomed her into a relationship, and later sexually assaulted her when they met in person. A week after the assault, May said the member sent her a message implying that he wanted to hurt her.</p><p>May reported the incident to her unit’s leadership. She said leadership banned the player and promised to work on blacklisting him from the particular game’s community, but that, according to a friend of May’s, the unit did not communicate with other units about the danger the player posed.&nbsp;</p><p>“I left [the unit] ‘cause that is just no longer a safe place for me to be in if they’re lying to my face about that,” May said.</p><p>Aurelia described how putting her pronouns in her Discord bio made players treat her differently. When joining a unit, she does “a lot of sleuthing” to tell if a unit is a safe space for her or not.</p><p>“Joining [a] unit, you get to look through some of the things that have been said in the unit, and you can kind of tell this isn’t quite a safe space,” Aurelia said.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>Aurelia had joined another <em>Halo</em> unit where she said she met some “really awesome people,” but ran into some “really bad eggs” as well. One player in particular, she says, was “just given a pass to be a bad person.”</p><p>“They made some very inappropriate comments towards me on my first day joining the unit,” Aurelia recalled. “When that happened to me, and I told people about it, they just basically shrugged and said, ‘Oh well, that’s Person, that’s what they do.’”</p><p>“I made a big fuss about it for like a month,” Aurelia said. “It was one of the first, like, negative experiences that I really took a stand for instead of just leaving, and I’m so glad that I did because I got to meet a whole lot of really good people. I really got to help improve that community in a way, which is awesome. But, you know, I got to learn a whole lot about what it means to just let somebody do what they want in that way, and [it] certainly made me feel a little uncomfortable.”</p><p>But Aurelia also understood some of the dynamics at play of why such “bad eggs” had trouble being removed from a community — they’re people’s friends. It’s hard to call out a friend when they fuck up, Aurelia said.</p><p>“I can see across the fence, and it’s hard to want to look at your friend and say, ‘Hey, that was really fucked up,’” Aurelia said. “A lot of people don’t do that. They won’t call their friends out on that kind of shit.”</p><p>When harassment is spewed on Discord, May said trans women will sometimes be the only members to speak up. But members of a unit can get “unspoken privileges" if they’ve been around long enough as part of a “loyalty system that [leadership] will consider.”</p><p>“In almost all of my experience with <em>Arma</em>, you will not be heard if you are a trans woman,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Masculinity in gaming</strong></h2><p>What some members of the 1st Selkie Platoon experienced in <em>Arma 3</em> is indicative of a wider masculine culture in gaming. Megan Condis, a professor at Texas Tech University who studies intersections of technology and gender, said that she’s seeing a comeback in one of the ways gamers show they are in the “in-group,” through the use of slurs in multiplayer games.</p><p>“Two years ago, I would’ve said that it is no longer considered necessarily a marker of gamer identity or a way that you demonstrate that you’re within the ‘in-group’ of online gaming culture to use those kinds of slurs or to just sort of casually throw around misogynist or homophobic rhetoric,” Condis said.&nbsp;</p><p>She said the lead-up to the 2024 election and the rise of the “manosphere” through streamers and podcasters has reframed that kind of rhetoric. Commentators would argue that they don’t <em>agree </em>with the slurs, but that the censorship of them is a result of the Left and so they use slurs “to emphasize how much [they] care about freedom of speech.” To them, the Left is the “censorious overseer” keeping you, the real gamer, from saying those words, instead of the wider gaming culture disavowing them.</p><p>“‘We need to, on the micro scale, take back gaming culture from these feminist critics or companies that have diversity officers or whatever,’” she described this viewpoint. “‘On the macro scale, we need to take America back from the Woke.’”</p><p>These rhetorical ideas spread in certain spaces more than others, she said.</p><p>“Multiplayer competitive eSports-style spaces are often more steeped in this masculinist communication style — and by that I don’t even necessarily mean that they’re full of men, but everyone who participates is expected to conform to speaking in this particular way or taking this [position],” Condis said.</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, how players are perceived in video games can be influenced by their avatar. In games where a player’s role is designated by a character — such as Tracer in <em>Overwatch</em> — the player is represented by that character.</p><p>“The structure of the game causes you to think less about the person operating the computer and more about the function of the avatar and the abilities the avatar has, whereas a game like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Minecraft</em> even, the players’ avatars are representatives of the player in the game world,” Condis said.</p><p><em>Arma 3</em> has no default customization options for women. You can select military gear and your character’s head and voice, but they are all masculine. This could make players slip into masculine pronouns because that’s the “story of the game” being presented to them, Condis said. Asking whether a player is male or female might not even occur to another player.</p><p>“The assumption is, ‘Of course it’s a guy. Why would I even ask?’ And so then it becomes easy to just slip into that assumption all the time,” she said. “The software doesn’t seem to even consider the possibility that anyone else would be participating.”</p><p>That assumption has leaked into how player communities teach newcomers. May has read handbooks written for new players, and she said many of them are gendered towards men.</p><p>One unit May joined was particularly egregious. “This was prevalent in most documents for that unit, like ‘The soldier will set his gun on full auto. The soldier will throw his grenade. You’ll protect the man in front of you,’” May recalled. “There is absolutely assumed maleness in <em>Arma 3</em>.”</p><h2><strong>“I just want to have some femininity in it</strong>"</h2><p>The players I talked to all espoused how <em>Arma 3</em> has provided them special experiences despite the numerous obstacles thrown at them by other units.</p><p>For Aurelia and Myra, they think if Bohemia Interactive provided female player options, their experiences would improve much more.</p><p>“I just want to have some femininity in it,” Aurelia said. “I don’t want to have this bulky box chest, you know? I wanna feel a little more comfortable and easily identifiable [as a woman] from a distance — a smaller frame, a smaller figure.”</p><p>Myra understands that female player models means additional modeling work for developers in a game that is already trying to make authentic, detailed models. But other modern military shooters – <em>Call of Duty, Battlefield, </em>and the more tactical <em>Insurgency: Sandstorm –</em> are open to representing women in combat roles — why not <em>Arma</em>?</p><p>“When you have a multiplayer experience where [you can modify] player expression, whether it be selecting skin tones, equipment, [faces] and gear, then why not just go that extra mile and give representation for those who have not been given representation in the past, especially in these kinds of communities?” Myra said.</p><p>Myra also wants Bohemia Interactive to add more safeguards against harassment, though e understood how it’s difficult to police a decentralized community. But as Bohemia works on <a href="https://reforger.armaplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Arma Reforger</em></a> — a side-game that’s a sort of testing ground for the team’s new engine — and <em>Arma 4</em>, Myra said multiplayer is becoming more centralized through official servers and the previously PC-exclusive series making its way to consoles.</p><p>“[Safety tools are] definitely something that they need to kind of put serious thought into,” Myra said. “There’s no excuse to not do it anymore.”</p><p>Bohemia Interactive spokesperson Pavel Křižka said the team is “not sharing any details” about <em>Arma 4</em>, but “However, our new technology—the ‘Enfusion engine’—is introducing many new and improved features to help create even more immersive and diverse worlds.” He did not specify whether female player options were part of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>Křižka also said Bohemia is “including built-in mechanisms to report inappropriate behavior.” He said “flagging inappropriate behavior” and kicking players through voting and admin intervention were already available in <em>Arma 3</em>, and those tools would “most probably be evolved” in <em>Arma 4</em>.</p><p>Currently, <em>Arma 3 </em>provides a vote kick option on public servers, but to address any harassment, you have to speak to the community’s admins or moderators in charge of the server.</p><p><em>Arma</em> communities also institute their own rules to manage their communities. As Aurelia joined multiple units over seven years, she came across a familiar rule — don’t talk politics.</p><p>While the rule seems fine on the surface, Aurelia found that when servers have that rule, politics tend to include her own transgender identity. The rule constricts her from feeling like she can be herself, she said.</p><p>“We are all inherently political — that’s what politics has done, like the world has done that to us,” she said. “The LGBTQ+ community is now a political thing because [others have] made it that way.”</p><p>Bohemia Interactive seems to share some of this “no politics” sentiment, according to an answer they gave to me when I asked why their games have not acknowledged or celebrated Pride month. Křižka said the company does not celebrate it, either.</p><p>“As a company, we are strictly apolitical and we do not aim to participate in such global activities,” Křižka told me. “Instead, we focus on creating a pleasant and inspirational working environment in our studio for all people, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or beliefs.”</p><p>Aurelia said she has seen more and more servers dropping the “no politics” rule. Rather than not talking politics, servers will instead ask to keep any political discussion civil and kind.</p><p>“I like seeing that,” she said. “They’re not trying to erase. They’re just trying to promote healthy discussion.”</p><h2><strong>“It’s a community that is made for the trans community</strong>"</h2><p>Back on the moon, the operation to take over the MAC cannon had an explosive climax. My squad was split between guarding the cannon’s northern gate, while Myra and I held our ground at the entrance into the cannon. The cannon blew up the pirates’ ship — however, the alien Covenant races landed on the moon right after.</p><p>We were outnumbered. The northern gate fell after Stella and my squadmate with a rocket launcher were downed, with their bodies trapped on the other side of the wall. Myra and I shot at the Covenant from a small barricade, but we quickly ran out of ammo. Eventually, we both went down after I accidentally overdosed on morphine and Myra died trying to carry my body to safety.</p><p>I’ve played a lot of milsims, and, on occasion, I have joined units in games like <em>Arma 3</em>. Many of my fellow players were men. There was only one unit that I recalled having trans women. After I left the unit, one of them told me that they were harassed by another player in that unit.</p><p>The 1st Selkies made me recall fond memories of playing in units, coordinating, and planning together. There wasn’t any drama. Our debrief touched on mistakes people made, but those mistakes were always framed in how they could do better next time.</p><p>Stella told me before I joined that she wants the Selkies to feel like a casual unit, just like any other, but one that’s safe for trans women.</p><p>“ We are forming the space to be very much for trans women and for general gaming as well,” she said. “A lot of that is making it a space where we can have a normal relationship with other people and develop friendships.”</p><p>When I asked Aurelia, Myra and May about the Selkies, they only had positive things to say.</p><p>“It’s a community that is made for the trans community,” Aurelia said. “I’ll never find another place that I feel more safe.”</p><p>May plays with the Selkies only occasionally, as she’s focused on developing the Purple Team. Having a team full of trans women was when she felt “completely comfortable” for the first time, she said.</p><p>“I still feel completely comfortable [in the Selkies],” she said.</p><p>Myra started to transition recently, and the Selkies provided em with an opportunity to find emself.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’d say the Selkies are kind of the first group that I’ve been able to just kind of be myself and try more things out,” Myra said, choking up. “The Selkies have provided me with a wonderful opportunity to kind of tread new water and test some stuff out, and [to] just be genuine.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arriving on Switch next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/absolum">Absolum</a>'s roguelike / beat 'em up fusion since we first went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-absolum-dead-cells-meets-streets-of-rage-4-in-an-effortlessly-stylish-rogue-em-up">hands-on</a> with it earlier this year. Ahead of its launch on <strong>9th October</strong>, publisher and co-developer Dotemu has today revealed a new gameplay trailer, and it looks every bit as stylish as we were expecting.</p>
<p>Aside from giving us a closer look at the fantasy beat 'em up action, the new trailer showcases some of the game's meta progression, helpful additions like co-op and recruitments, and explains how your path through the lands of Talamh can produce permanent game changes.</p>
<p>It's also a nice opportunity to get reacquainted with the four main Absolum heroes: sturdy gun-wielding dwarf Karl, well-rounded swordsman Galandra, acrobatic rogue Cider and ranged frog wizard Brome — yes, <em>frog wizard</em>.</p>
<p>If you want a closer look after checking out the above trailer, here's a handful of screens from Dotemu:</p>

<p>It looks like a blast, and if our brief hands-on time was anything to go by, it will be — assuming it scrubs up nicely on Switch. Every game under the sun seems to be coming our way in October, but this one might just be worth making some room for.</p>

			<p>When I was jumping into Techland's Dying Light: The Beast, it wasn't for the third time since the first title's release in 2015. It was for my very first, and like an amateur parkourer trying to jump across one roof to another for the first time, I was cautiously enthusiastic. Aware that this could go horribly wrong, or be an amazing thrill.</p>



<p>Thankfully, after fearing I would suffer the former in my early hours, my time with it leaned closer to the latter thanks to its survival elements and the two tried-and-true pillars of the series. I began to understand why one of my best friends has put in hundreds of hours between the first two games.</p>



<p>Of course, I had heard a lot about the first two games, so I knew the basics. There are zombies, a first-person parkour system, and a focus on melee combat. I didn't know who Kyle Crane was, but thankfully, the game is prepared for me and other such players since there's a quick recap video ready to give you Cole's (Kyle's) notes on Crane's last outing.</p>

<p>This is all to say that everything about Dying Light was new to me, and what is now old hat for veterans of the series had a stronger impact on me because it was new. Like, how the parkour feels absolutely wild. Keeping to the rooftops was always a fun challenge that I enjoyed solving on the fly as a longtime fan of platformers. Finding a flow within it all and running across ledges or high wires to leap through half-open windows felt exhilarating. And all the more disappointing when a wrong step sent me to the ground.</p>



<p>But while I could see how its movement and combat could keep you locked in for hours, the whole package of The Beast lost me before I hit credits, thanks to some poor design choices and some flaws that brought the experience down from the start.</p>



<p>Overall, I found that Dying Light: The Beast is a land of contrasts, with equal parts I could do without and elements I loved as a newcomer to the series. It's a completely fine videogame; an enjoyable time, surely, for someone invested in Crane's story arc more than a newcomer like me could be, and anyone who appreciates crunchy and satisfying zombie kills.</p>

<p>Before I dig deeper, a few bits of needed context. Dying Light: The Beast brings the first game's protagonist, Kyle Crane, back into the spotlight after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a>'s Aiden Caldwell took center stage. Crane's story kicks back up in a research facility where he's been tested on and tortured for years. After being the personal lab rat to a man we know as 'The Baron' for a decade, when Crane gets his opportunity to escape, he succeeds and vows to take revenge.</p>



<p>You begin to meet a cast of characters along that journey, like Olivia, a mysterious woman who helps you escape in the first place and get stronger to take on The Baron. Jacob, the Sheriff, and the people of the Town Hall, who give you a place to rest your head while you help them stay alive, and help you in your fight against The Baron. Of course, getting revenge on the Baron and helping your new friends survive isn't as simple as it sounds at the beginning of the game, and the story unfolds in a fairly straightforward manner.</p>

<p>I won't go any further into details to avoid spoilers, but what I'll say is that I don't think anyone will play Dying Light: The Beast for its story. I found it to be fairly bland and overall uninteresting, especially because the performance from Roger Craig Smith (Kyle Crane) jumped from contextually tone-deaf open-world quest speak to some emotionally charged and impactful moments, with Smith wonderfully portraying the anger Crane carries with him, and how his never-ending crusade to help people in impossible situations can lead to moments where Crane is reminded of the good that people are capable of. Nothing felt consistent, making it all the more difficult for me to get invested in the story.</p>



<p>And those better moments often came from side quests instead of the main campaign, which is a scenario that's always disappointed me in games. I've never subscribed to the notion that good side quests make up for a lacking core campaign. I think it's just another way of saying 'Don't worry, the game gets way better once you're 10 hours in,' since I might have to spend that kind of time getting to the side quests that are supposed to make the other bad parts worth it.</p>



<p>There are some undeniably cool and tense gameplay moments I won't spoil here, included in the missions you'll complete for the main campaign. It also has two boss fights out of the several you encounter that stand out as trying to do something more engaging with its combat, but the primary campaign never evolved beyond being a vehicle through which new characters and more interesting side quests are introduced.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Most of the infected you fight in boss encounters end up becoming an infected variant you can find while running around the game's map, and are also repeated in later boss fights.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With regards to the gameplay, as I said before, the parkour mechanics can feel exhilarating with how fluidly you can move from rooftop to rooftop, particularly when you get a grapple hook in the back half of the game. But there's a fairly major bone I have to pick with how you get around in Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>A large chunk of the map is an area called Old Town, with tall buildings and rooftops galore to parkour through. There are other smaller town-like areas around it, but Old Town is where the game's parkour mechanics shine best. The rest of the map? A giant park with trees and bushes that you'll either run on your own two feet through or drive through to go from one objective to another. I thought I was playing a parkour open-world game, not a game where getting across the map in a reasonable amount of time means scavenging for fuel and going out of my way to find the closest working truck.</p>



<p>Every moment I spent driving instead of parkouring felt antithetical to what I thought was a key part of Dying Light's pitch. Could you imagine Insomniac making players drive around New York as Spider-Man as a significant part of how you're supposed to get around, instead of his usual web swinging? That's how against the grain it felt to get into a car in this game. I can understand it as an added layer to the survival and resource management woven into the gameplay, or even just as Techland wanting to try something new (although it was already a part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Following expansion</a>). It just doesn't work to the game's benefit.</p>


<figure>

<figure><figcaption>The driving doesn't even feel good.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Dying Light: The Beast's other core gameplay pillar, melee combat, doesn't have the same kind of problem. It's just good; the weapons are fun to use, the modifiers you can craft for them add some decent effects, particularly for critical hits, and entering Kyle's new 'Beast Mode' never lost its touch due to how perfectly Techland nailed it with attack and finishing animations that really make you feel like you could tear through anything.</p>



<p>On the flip side of tearing through enemies, I deeply enjoyed how tense I got if I was caught out at night. The threat of Volatiles around each corner and 'the chase' to get back to a safe zone had my heart pounding nearly every time, and trying to navigate while sneaking around to avoid a chase felt like one of the most intense cat-and-mouse games within a videogame I've ever played, as I did what I could to find my way in the dark, only turning my flashlight on for a few brief seconds to try and figure out my path forward without ringing a Volatiles' dinner bell.</p>



<p>I also happen to like weapon durability, and I appreciated that there were enough strong weapons to be found, crafted, and repaired that I didn't have to be precious with what I used. I enjoyed switching between different weapon classes to see what I preferred, and how a weapon's unique shape impacted my infected/human slicing skills, and making the necessary resource choices to either keep a weapon I'm having fun with going or move on to something else.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>What I could have done without is the color-coded system and slow upgrade pacing for everything, particularly the gear Crane wears. When upgrading your weapon's blueprints, you'll almost always see meaningful improvements in damage output, and what Crane is wearing hardly felt like it was impacting gameplay at all.</p>



<p>Levelling up, obviously, has a greater impact on your health, stamina, etc, than any piece of gear could. XP is, however, dolled out slowly, and the four sections of a skill tree you work your way through just feel like they are there because skill trees are a staple of the genre. The abilities on the trees feel empty, like they're included in the game because it's what's expected.</p>



<p>I don't mind a good skill tree, but when you're dedicating a late-game ability slot to just being able to craft a grenade launcher, that can't help but feel like a lack of creativity. I'd already found blueprints to craft items in the overworld, so why couldn't I have found grenade launcher blueprints? I understand it as a way to determine the flow of the challenge in a game so that players are not running around with an overpowered weapon from the get-go. But if pacing out the power fantasy of the endgame and managing the difficulty scale are the goals, then I think it would be far more engrossing to see that done through melee encounters and the abilities you can unlock to empower those encounters.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And while Castor Woods almost always looks like a scene from a postcard, Techland's style of zombies, or infected, or whatever you'd like to call them, is genuinely freaky in a way I really appreciated. They're bloody, gory, and fall apart to my knife with a satisfying, blood-splattering slash. Whenever I saw another head roll, it just made me think of my favorite slasher films, and made me want to keep playing to chop off another zombie's head.</p>



<p>Lastly, a note on the game's performance. I did hit a few frame rate drops here and there, playing on my laptop with an NVIDIA 3070Ti and an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS on medium settings, but it didn't happen with any consistency that it broke my experience. What actually broke my experience was a progression-blocking bug I encountered early on in the game, though that was before a day-one patch was issued ahead of release, so hopefully it is fixed and you'll be spared having to rollback your save like I did to get around it. All I ask of my games is that they look good and run smoothly, and for the majority of my 35+ hours it took to hit credits, that was how The Beast ran.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast has two core pillars that are fairly strong, and if you are already a fan of the series, then there's sure to be plenty here for you to enjoy, even if it might not knock it out of the park in every element. If you're new to the series and have no prior attachments to it, but love a good zombie-killing game now and then, I'd push you to really consider how much you want to spend your money on this game, when there are so many better games to spend your time with in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Overall, those two pillars only keep the game interesting for as long as you want to keep your brain turned off. A dash of well-executed survival elements around those pillars doesn't make up for the rest of the ways the game is lacking, making Dying Light: The Beast a missable title as we move into the final months of 2025 with plenty of major releases on the horizon.</p>

					<h2>Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go *splat.*</p>

							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Castor Woods is a gorgeous setting
</li><li>Combat is fun and satisfying to pull off, and Beast Mode feels especially fun to engage

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic announced today that beginning this December, developers making their own games in Fortnite will be able to sell in-game items directly from their items as a new line of potential revenue on top of the revenue already received from engagement payouts.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items">blog post</a> on the official Fortnite website, where Epic explained that as part of this new feature's implementation, developers will earn 100% of the value from sales in their islands from December 2025 through to the end of 2026. After that, the normal rate earned will be 50%.</p>



<p>Payouts from engagement are also being updated, with an update coming on November 1, 2025, to include changes like "<em>Creators that bring in new or lapsed players will receive 75% of those players' contributions to the engagement payout pool for their first six months</em>."</p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Epic will also add a sponsored row to its Discover page. "<em>All creators will have transparent market data to bid for placement in the row and enter an auction to surface islands in the new Sponsored Row,</em>" Epic writes. The revenue split will also follow the same timeline as the sale of in-game items, with developers receiving 100% from revenue generated by being in the sponsored row from November 2025 through to the end of 2026, with it dropping to 50% afterwards.</p>



<p>Creator Communities are another new feature that Epic is launching in the next few months, letting developers "<em>build community forums with island updates, event information, feedback requests, and more</em>. <em>Creator posts will also appear to players in Fortnite across Island Lobbies, Island Pages, Creator Pages, and a new row in Discover</em>."</p>



<p>It's the latest step in Epic continuing to compete with <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-experiences-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-end-of-2025/">Roblox</a>, which comes across particularly with how Epic shares the difference between what can be earned on Roblox as a creator there versus developing games for Fortnite.</p>



<p>Whether this will actually generate more revenue for Fortnite developers is another question, since players will still have to want to buy these items in the first place.</p>



<p>"<em>Since UEFN launched, players have spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands, which has resulted in $722,000,000 paid out to date. We'll continue investing in new tools that unlock more development possibilities for creators</em>."</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>-related has happened <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">at an Australian museum again</a>. This time, rather than the game being confirmed for an appearance back when it was still infinitely mysterious and sans release date, it's Team Cherry devs addressing just how difficult their creation is, following plenty of post-release discourse on the subject.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">first patch making a couple of its early bosses a bit easier</a> to tackle, amid debate as to whether it's just good and hard, or pushes into unnecessarily annoying slog territory via the likes of bench placement and hazards being able to deal out two masks of damage. As with every FromSoft game since time itself began with the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a>, where you stand on that bickering will likely depend on how prepared you are to spend hours battling one foe over and over again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Naturally, the appropriate venue for Team Cherry co-directors Ari Gibson and William Pellen to weigh in on this conundrum of our time is Australia’s national museum of screen culture, <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/">ACMI</a>, where the launch of a new exhibition was attended and reported on by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>.</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson said when asked about the difficulty by exhibition co-curator Jini Maxwell. "So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes."</p><p>While acknowledging that Skong packs "some moments of steep difficulty", Gibson stuck to emphasising that going for a wander is the best medicine if you get stuck banging your head against a bug-shaped wall, as there are "ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely". Learning? In a video game? Come on lads, I can't be doing that. I use my brain for marginally more important things during the average day, but by the time I get to playing games for non-work purposes, it's all just mush up there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress. Gibson and Pellen also explained the differences between developing Silksong and the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> from a hardness perspective. Hornet, with her superior zippiness and superior skills to the knight, demanded more complicated base enemies to make sure she still faced a good challenge.</p>
<p>"The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss," Pellen said. "The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight’s enemies, Hornet’s enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away."</p>
<p>I imagine this was followed up with a gesture to some screens of culture as the devs indicated that the time had come to check out the Aussie exhibitions. If you're still struggling with Silksong, definitely check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">our great Silksong walkthrough</a> Ollie's worked very hard on.

            <p>Parkoury zombie bludgeoner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has, literally just this minute, gone on sale, which means the review embargo curtain has lifted on RPS to reveal... an empty chair with an IOU stuck to it.</p>
<p>This one is my bad, rather than because of any cheeky <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">code</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">withholding</a>. I’d simply underestimated how many trillions of PC games were also out this week, and had to abandon my charge through The Beast to help keep the undermanned Treehouse on top of things elsewhere. Still, we’ll shortly be bringing you a full, likely much better appraisal from RPS veteran Dominic Tarason (thaaaaaanks Dominic), and in penance, I offer some initial impressions from my couple of hours with the game’s opening.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-wants-to-make-you-afraid-of-the-dark-again">Techland weren’t kidding about the nighttime</a>. In response to complaints that the nocturnally inclined zombs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a> weren’t sufficiently scary after the sun goes down, The Beast looks to put more horror back in the darkness. Successfully, in the mind of this wimp. Between the night’s pitch blackness, the keyring LED you call a torch, and the sprinting, lethally hench super-zeds that aren’t at all keen on sharing the game’s rooftops, any sort of freerunning you were flexing with during the daylight hours is effectively reduced to nervous shimmying through the void.</p>
<p>Yet it still feels like you’re <em>supposed</em> to be chased back to the safehouse by these burly Volatile bois now and then, in which case panic and near-blindness become enemies in themselves. Several attempts to survive my first night ended with my shinbones shooting up into my lungs, the stress of a pursuit having overwhelmed my ability to consider whether a roof-to-roof jump was actually doable before I hurled myself into the cobbles below. It’s not always "fun", strictly speaking. But it is decent horror.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>If anything, The Beast’s brighter hours could do with more of this urgency. The bread-and-butter meleeing benefits from some nicely heavy hittin' sticks, but the actual swinging sensation is on the wrong side of sluggish, at least in these early stages. The first two bosses aren't that exhilarating either: they require little in the way of sharp timing or last-gasp dodging, outside of a few repeating, heavily telegraphed attacks.</p><p>Visually and practically, they’re also just minor variations on the same 'What if a ghoul was taller and shredded' concept, which somewhat saps the excitement out of your stated mission of hunting and killing as many of these souped- up zeds as possible. Fleeting thrills can be had in the moments when you transform into a berzerking monsterman yourself, ripping off limbs and punching through chest cavities, but the time limit on this literal beast mode seems disappointingly stingy, considering how many regular shovel hits it takes to build up the gauge.</p>
<p>Again, mind, I’d only got two hours into what is supposedly a 20-hour-plus campaign. And I was similarly insta-fatigued by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">apparently ain’t half bad</a> once it gets rolling. Maybe I really <em>should</em> stick to hardware, in which case, I’ll note that Dying Light: The Beast has also been granted Verified status for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – justifiably so, as it repeatedly breached 60fps on my Steam Deck OLED when running in Performance mode. There is the slight hitch of an Epic Game Store pop-up asking on launch if you want to sync accounts, but it doesn’t throw up any serious non-Steam-app compatibility woes, and can be banished with a tap of the B button on subsequent boots.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-horse-race">Patrick Recommends: Horse Race</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Horses, baby!</span></figcaption></figure><p>In my younger days, I liked hanging out at a bar for hours. Yeah, fine, part of the reason was to be irresponsible at an age when I could afford to, but it was a reason to sit around with a group of people for an extended period of time and <em>talk</em>. Even though my circle of friends are not board game people, I get the appeal. It's the same idea. It's a justification to be around people and pass the time.</p><p>In the past year or so, some friends introduced us to our new obsession: <em>Horse Race</em>. I've tried to find out the origins of this goofy and unpredictable dice game, but maybe your AI-garbled searches will produce better information than mine.</p><p>Here is the short pitch on <em>Horse Race</em>, though. </p><p>You have a board where a series of horses are moving forward on the board if you roll the number that matches the horse. The more unlikely the number combination, the fewer spots the horse has to move. Four of the horses each round are "scratched," determined by one person rolling four times. From there, you move around the table and have each person keep rolling until a horse crosses the finish line. Each time you roll a scratched horse, you have to pay into the pot. What you pay escalates based on the order in which it was scratched, i.e. a horse in the "four" spot means you have other pay up 4X.</p><p>(<a href="https://fgbradleys.com/wp-content/uploads/rules/Horse%20Race%20Game.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOorW5Z2PleP_2_lQte0U9PFHmS4iR3vW_yS8aUll9darWq1f9EGu&amp;ref=remapradio.com">The full rules are here</a>, but like many games of this type, you're like to and are encouraged to have house rules.) </p><p>It's completely random. There is no skill. It's also so goddamn fun. We've had nights stretch into the collective bedtime for the children of parents involved because, well, maybe if we just did one more round...? I lost all of my money last time around, and would happily head back into the horse breach to try and claw it all back.</p><p>(Usually, we play with nickels and dimes. Last time, we escalated to quarters.)</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-vintage-asmr">Rob Recommends: Vintage ASMR</h3><figure><figcaption><span>"ASMR Working to decipher a message on a captured Enigma, this 1940's scientist has a breakthrough!" is a very unique YouTube title. Credit: Jake Hellbach</span></figcaption></figure><p>I am just going to share an awesome thing that Carolyn Petit was posting about the other night: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JakeHellbach/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=1&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">The Jake Hellbach Vintage ASMR</a> Youtube channel. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carolynmichelle.bsky.social/post/3lu4ajqpmos2y?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Carolyn described his work</a> as being "staged and shot with care, and the vibe i often get from them is something like "could have been footage of a character in a '90s FMV game doing their thing."</p><p>Admittedly, I can be shaky on what is ASMR and what is not. I'd call his longer videos ambient or mood pieces, but the important thing is that in a landscape littered with lousy hacked-together scene renders, this guy is making unique short films with good photography and <em>excellent </em>prop design and selection. In fact, looking at his channel, it seems like he's a prop master as much as a photographer. </p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgkqijUiEf8&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">an early video of his</a> is just five minutes of footage of a train compartment set where a man is writing something on a manual typewriter and jotting down notes. But off to his right, my eyes immediately locked onto an old pre-war Lucky Strike package, when the orange disc had become part of the brand design but before they moved to the white wrapper.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The advantages of a laptop goes without saying, but lets say it anyway. It’s portable. It’s a portable computer you can take anywhere with you. But I’m here to tell you, “Big whoop.” a lot of us end up just doing our work from the same spot anyway and if you don’t need that portability, you can save some cash by just going with a tower instead. <strong>Take a look at Dell’s Vostro 3030 PC tower.</strong> This is the kind of computer that does what’s expected of it and nothing more. A capital P, capital C <em>PC</em>.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/"> It normally goes for $899, but Amazon happens to have it right now for 33% off. Right now, you’ll save $299, bringing the price down to just $600 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>Diving into the specs, what we have here is a 13-inch by 6-inch by 12inch PC tower powered by a 14th generation Intel Core i3-14100 processor and an integrated Intel UHD 730 graphics card. It’s loaded with 32GB of RAM which while make your performance-intensive apps run fast and react snappy. As far as storage is concerned, the Dell Vostro 3030 is equipped with a PCIe SSD with a capacity of 1TB. You can expect fast load times from anything off this solid state drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compatibility Options</h2>
<p>One big bonus PC towers have over laptops—the ports. With a newer laptop you might have to suffice with just one, maybe two USB slots along the side. That’s not the case here. This Dell tower comes with three USB-A ports and one USB-C, and that’s just on the front. Turn it around and you’ll be greeted with four more USB Type-A ports. That makes eight USB ports in total.</p>



<p>Other connections you’ll find are an HDMI and DisplayPort so you can set yourself up with two monitors side by side. You also have an Ethernet port on the back and a combination headphone/microphone audio jack conveniently on the front. The Dell tower supports Bluetooth so you can pair wirelessly to headphones or other accessories like your mouse or gaming controller. Wi-Fi 6 support enables you to take advantage of fast download and upload speeds.</p>
<p>The Dell PC tower comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro. That comes with support for OneDrive and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/">For a limited time, Dell’s Vostro 3030 PC tower is heavily discounted at Amazon. Get it right now for $299 off.</a> That brings the price all the way down from $899 to just $600.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the past decade, video game remakes have become more and more prevalent. Most years see at least one major remake attempt to rekindle the nostalgia of old fans and show new players the achievements of days gone by. And while there’s an argument to be had about games being stuck in the past, we can’t deny what a thrill it is to see our favourites of yesteryear given a modern makeover. Remember when Final Fantasy 7’s Cloud was six purple polygons and a yellow spike? Well, he’s a supermodel these days. (The spikes are still there, thankfully.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what are the qualities of a good remake? That’s an increasingly difficult question. Once upon a time it was enough for a remake to simply update something with modern graphics. But as the games industry has evolved, so have tastes and gameplay systems, and thus remakes have changed, too. Now a remake can offer a truly new experience to both long-term and new fans, with fresh new takes on decades-old ideas. The very best remakes are carefully-observed balancing acts that find the sweet spot between faithful recreation and exciting new ideas. In some cases, that’s the game exactly as you <em>thought </em>you remembered it, now unshackled from old hardware limitations. In others, its radical recreations that provide an alternate vision of the original’s core idea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all that in mind, let’s explore the very best video game remakes. These are the 15 strongest examples of remakes, judged not by their overall quality as games, but by how each project achieved its new, upgraded ambitions and brought new perspectives to old classics.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Video Game Remakes</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">15. Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/pokemon-heartgold-soulsilver-1757063407995.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Gold and Silver, though only the second in the long-running Pokemon series, are the only entries that allowed you to travel across two different regions and collect 16 badges instead of the standard eight. That meant two "end-game" challenges to conquer, two sets of Legendary Pokemon to collect, 16 different gym leaders to defeat, and more. The enhanced Nintendo DS remakes bring that sprawling journey into full color and utilizes the superior hardware to seamlessly bring improved music, better UI, and WiFi capabilities. With the addition of new content like the National Dex, increasing the total Pokemon from 251 to 493, the grueling battle frontier, and everyone’s favorite, the Pokeathlon mini-games, there is so much more to explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-heartgold-version">HeartGold</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-soulsilver-version">SoulSilver</a> introduced to the Pokewalker, the original Pokemon Go, which allowed you to take your favorite Pokemon outdoors and gain levels by walking around… or cheat by shaking the Pokewalker. Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver added new life to the classic adventure, reimagining the original experience with fun and challenging additions to appeal to both new and returning fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/10/linkawakeningbr-1749597347808.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the mammoth success of Breath of the Wild, Nintendo did a complete 180 for its next The Legend of Zelda project. Rather than the grand and ambitious open world of Hyrule, it looked back to the compact and twisty overworld of 1993’s Link’s Awakening. The 2019 version of this Game Boy classic is near enough a beat-for-beat remake, just reimagined with a delightfully cute toy town aesthetic. This faithful approach means that the distant memory of one of Link’s earliest adventures is fully restored, now elegantly elevated thanks to its seamless map and more easily-navigated dungeons. A number of quality-of-life improvements are the cherry on top, including the ability to mark important discoveries on the map, and doors that remain open after being unlocked (seriously, you wouldn't believe how frustrating that one was back in the ‘90s.) This Switch remaster does unsuccessfully try something new with the lacklustre build-your-own Chamber Dungeons system, but everything it recreates it does so with an enchanting touch.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Live A Live</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/live-a-live-1757062785542.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty of wonderful games are deserving of remakes, but none perhaps needed one as much as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/live-a-live">Live A Live</a>, the 1994 Square Enix RPG that preceded Chrono Trigger and laid the groundwork for not only that game, but numerous beloved classics that followed. Live A Live’s unique structure, following seven characters from different eras through distinct vignettes, was groundbreaking both back in the day and once again in the 2022 remake, to say nothing of the ways in which it ultimately threads its themes and overarching narrative through its separate parts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2022 remake gave Live A Live a desperately-needed makeover in gorgeous HD2D and reorchestrated its fantastic soundtrack, all while keeping its wonderful story intact with its first-ever localization outside of Japan. In a final flourish, Live A Live’s remake adds a small but massively impactful piece of new content in its final hours that throws its ending into a hopeful new light, and makes its emotional conclusion all the more powerful.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/mgs-delta-1757062843674.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The philosophy behind many remakes is unlocking ambitions that were once hindered by technological limitations. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> makes the interesting decision to embrace those limitations – its sprawling Soviet jungle remains divided by load screens, the scope of its playspaces defined by the limits of the original PlayStation 2 hardware. You’ll see the term “faithful remake” used a lot through this list, but none are as faithful as MGS Delta – this is a PS2 game in PS5 clothing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what a PS2 game it is. Arguably the pinnacle of Hideo Kojima’s career, what was once a groundbreaking stealth game is now an enduring classic, thanks to its playful approach to Cold War espionage and its dramatic, cinematic story. Snake Eater has been iterated upon many times across the years, and MGS Delta collects together years of improvements and enhances them all with incredibly glossy modern graphics and an updated control system that finally turns Snake into the nimble operator he was always meant to be. This may not be a revolutionary remake, but it does a solid job of preserving perfection for a brand new generation.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Black Mesa</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/black-mesa-1757062874152.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of remakes on this list that were developed by studios that didn’t create the original game, but there is only one that was developed by <em>fans </em>of the original. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa </a>is a complete remake of Valve’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a>, created by enthusiasts and officially supported by the original developer. And you can easily see why it won that support: this is a truly phenomenal rebuild of one of the most important first-person shooters of all time. It captures the distinctly creepy atmosphere and excellent combat that made Half-Life such a pioneer, while also augmenting almost every level with something new, be that a reimagined combat encounter or a Half-Life 2-style physics puzzle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's the final missions that really make Black Mesa a vital part of the Half-Life story. The original game’s final arc, set on the world of Xen, is infamously a bit of an under-developed slog. Black Mesa completely redesigns that final stretch, eliminating the tedium and injecting a sense of creative, alien wonder. And while it’s true that Black Mesa took so long to create that, by the time of its release, it already looked dated, that’s only true if you consider it from a purely technical standpoint. Take one look at Xen, or the eerie abandoned corridors of the titular facility itself, and there’s no denying that Black Mesa is an artistic triumph.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Final Fantasy 7 Remake</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/ff7-remake-1757062890307.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It may literally be in the title, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> is more than just a remake. It’s also a reimagining of the 1997 JRPG classic, a reinterpretation of its achievements, and – somehow – also a <em>sequel </em>to the game it recreates. Oh, and it also only covers around the first 30% of the original story, which has been transformed from a brief journey through the city of Midgar into a massive, 30+ hour adventure. This approach certainly isn’t for everyone, but you can't deny the ambition of this lavish project. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first chapter of the three-part Final Fantasy 7 remake is a stunningly gorgeous RPG that gives new life to some of gaming’s most memorable characters and settings. With all that extra time, it successfully expands upon the story and weaves in new plot threads, such as robust backstories for members of the Avalanche team, more believable relationships between protagonist Cloud and his new buddies, and a better sense of life in the Sector 7 slums. On top of all that, it also completely revamps the combat system, creating a brand new, action-heavy, real-time system that feels both exhilaratingly new and highly evocative of the original game’s turn-based battles. FF7 Remake’s approach is exemplary, and makes many other games on this list feel more like remasters than remakes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Shadow of the Colossus</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/02/27/shadow-of-the-colossus-on-ps4-27152686679-o-1519761322276.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> was a landmark achievement when it hit the PS2 in 2005. Developer Team ICO built a lonely, desolate, deeply affecting world using hardware that could barely render its vision. While the game itself undeniably stands the test of time, it's clear to see that technical performance and visual clarity held back the studio’s incredible ambition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward 13 years and Bluepoint Games crafted an incredibly faithful remake, focused on overcoming those technical limitations so that the soul of the project could achieve its true ambitions. With a much steadier framerate, gorgeous graphics, and a commitment to keeping the events, systems, and mechanics of the original intact, Bluepoint absolutely hit it out of the park. It was such an achievement, in fact, that it won the studio the chance to remake Demon’s Souls, as well as laid the groundwork for its acquisition by PlayStation.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Demon's Souls</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/demons-souls-1757062963760.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After reaching the heights of Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, it was hard not to see 2009’s Demon’s Souls as the ageing, hollowed precursor to FromSoftware’s mighty success story. But it was undeniable that a fantastic, paradigm-shifting game remained, and Bluepoint Games’ 2020 remake of Demon’s Souls was a project dedicated to making those qualities shine again. It completely stripped away the technical shortcomings that held the PS3 version back, while adding several subtle quality of life upgrades that succeeded in modernizing the game to the point where if you’d never played the original, you could very likely be fooled into thinking that this was the latest entry in the Souls series as opposed to the very first one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bluepoint managed to stay completely respectful to the original vision in many ways (it is, for the most part, the exact same game just with modern, photo-realistic graphics and refreshed animations,) the alterations made to the art style and design of some locations wasn’t fully embraced by some fans of the original. Nevertheless, Demon’s Souls helped elevate what was already one of the best games of the PS3 era and bring it to a whole new, post-Dark Souls audience. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Metroid: Zero Mission</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/metroid-zero-mission-1757063296688.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Metroid was a groundbreaking NES game back in 1986, but when looked at through a modern lens, it’s hard to argue that it holds up. Fortunately, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-zero-mission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a> exists. Developed 18 years later, rather than opting for a 100% faithful remake with a couple of modernization tweaks, Metroid: Zero Mission is instead a game rebuilt from the ground up using the original Metroid as a blueprint for its story and level design. By allowing itself to explore beyond the boundaries of the source material, Nintendo was able to draw new inspirations from the more modern 2D Metroids, like Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zero Mission is now over 20 years old, and so the idea that it’s a “modern” version of Metroid is something of a bygone era. However, it remains an expertly crafted reinterpretation of one of Nintendo’s best ever games, and is both young and strong enough that it still holds up to this day – not only as one of the best Metroid games, but also one of the best remakes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Resident Evil 4</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/resident-evil-4-1757063000978.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has become somewhat synonymous with the idea of remakes, having now rebuilt no less than <em>four </em>of its Resident Evil games. Among them is the legendary Resident Evil 4 – Leon S. Kennedy’s action-packed descent into the Las Plagas-infected Spanish countryside. Of all the games Capcom has reinvented, Resi 4 was the one least in need of a refresh, but despite that, the RE4 remake is an astonishing feat that helps elevate an all-time classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purist fans may have been annoyed by the erasure of the original’s more eccentric ideas, but they have been replaced by an altogether darker, more horrifying tone that syncs Resident Evil 4 with Capcom’s other recent remakes. It also benefits from snappier, more energetic combat, complete with an excellent knife parry that makes fighting both the Armadura enemies and the Krauser boss battle much more intense. Perhaps most importantly, it vastly improves Ashley, both in terms of her depiction and the mechanics around protecting her, eliminating any sense that Resident Evil 4 is an annoying, multi-hour escort quest. Combine all that with an incredibly handsome graphical makeover and you’ve made a masterpiece feel even more essential.       </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Persona 3 Reload</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/persona-3-remake-1757063016839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Persona series are no strangers to new versions of the beloved Atlus RPGs arriving soon after their initial release – Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal both added significant social link, story, and dungeon additions, for example. But in terms of a full-on remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> is the first to have undergone a complete overhaul. Reload took the game’s foundational bullets and rechambered them into a much more stylish weapon — one that borrowed the best-in-class UI and menu systems of Persona 5 and rebuilt its colorful high-school surroundings and spooky shadow realm from the ground up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps its most exciting addition is the way Reload tweaks Persona 3’s battle system. Informed by the series entries that came after it, combat is a much more enticing prospect, thanks to the introduction of new skills, the ability to directly control each party member and shift between them baton pass-style, and the brand-new Theurgy system that allows for Personas to perform devastating Ultimate attacks. All of these changes, among others, breathed new, exciting life into an already treasured RPG, meaning Reload is now the definitive way to Persona 3.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Silent Hill 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/silent-hill-2-1757063033994.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Silent’s original Silent Hill 2 is rightfully considered one of the most affecting survival horror games of all time, and Bloober Team’s 2024 remake does nothing to diminish that. While the PS2 original has an incomparable, unsettling atmosphere thanks to its technological limitations, the remake uses modern graphical and sound techniques to generate a complimentary oppressive tone. As you explore the strange, abandoned town of Silent Hill, you can't help but let the dread creep in.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloober’s creation is incredibly faithful to the original game, following the same plot beats and exploring the same environments, but its new over-the-shoulder camera both pulls you deeper into its terrifying world and makes combatting the town’s grotesque inhabitants more intuitive. Those combat enhancements can really be felt in the boss battles, which are now reinvented as terrifying engagements rather than repeating the attritional slogs they once were. But really it’s the modern presentation of this bleak story that really makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> a vital remake: actor Luke Roberts breathes fresh new life into protagonist James Sunderland, providing a deeply troubled, nuanced performance that anchors this tale in inescapable grief and guilt.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Resident Evil</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/resident-evil-remake-1757063053876.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to faithful remakes that largely stick to the core design established in the original and focus instead on bringing everything else up to modern standards, there aren’t many games better than the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-remaster">Resident Evil remake</a>. The “REmake” adheres to everything that was intrinsic to the original, from the pre-rendered backgrounds, to the tank controls, to the limited inventory that forces you to make tough decisions on what to keep and what to toss. All these may be incredibly familiar for those who were there back in 1996, but they’re polished up to beautiful new standards. It may have old ideas, but it plays fantastically… which is impressive, considering this remake is already much older than the original game was when it was made. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Resident Evil isn’t just a shinier version of its source material. It also adds several entirely new features that change up the experience and give it its own identity. Whether it's the terrifying addition of dead enemies resurrecting as powerful Crimson Heads (unless you have the foresight and resources to burn the corpses) or the brand-new plot thread involving the horrifying Lisa Trevor, Resident Evil’s remake shines because not only is it a faithful remake that brings a PSOne classic into a modern light, but also because of the ways that it separates itself from that classic to become something even better.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/ff7-rebirth-1757063068737.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After having successfully pulled off a radical re-imagining with the first game in the trilogy, Square Enix faced a more daunting challenge with the second chapter of its Final Fantasy 7 remake project. It needed to recreate the most expansive section of the original game, redesign a huge variety of locations (including a whole theme park), add a number of new characters, <em>and </em>re-stage one of the most important emotional beats in RPG history. As with its predecessor, not all of these ambitions are met equally, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> is nonetheless an incredible, transformative achievement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most immediately impressive factor of Rebirth is its scope. While it doesn’t totally leave Remake’s linear structure behind, much of Rebirth takes place in sizable open hub worlds. While there is a touch of the Ubisoft box-ticking about them, they’re elevated by a smart approach to exploration that introduces a brand new gimmick with every zone, from buggies to planes to Chocobos that can climb walls and glide across chasms. It’s a smart reinvention of the original game’s freely-explored-but-ultimately-empty overworld. But it’s the continuation of Remake’s story and emotional core that makes Rebirth so strong – these modern interpretations of the core trio of Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith are among Square’s strongest-ever characters, and their journey here – which feels more authentic to the original than Remake’s more expansive efforts – is unforgettable. Oh, and that overhauled combat system? It’s even better here – perhaps the best Final Fantasy has ever had. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Resident Evil 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/02/15/residentevil-1644966155522.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>'s remake took what the original did so well - its labyrinthian level design, its disgusting enemies, its omnipresent sense of dread - and molded it into a horror game designed for modern audiences. The Raccoon City police station is cleverly reworked and expanded upon, enemies are faster, deadlier, and more unpredictable, and gorgeous lighting casts shadows over nasties waiting to grab you unawares. And, of course, the static camera angles and tank controls are traded in for third-person, over-the-shoulder shooting, which truly transports the PS1 classic into the modern era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Resident Evil 2’s biggest achievement, though, is the way Capcom has played with the original’s most iconic encounters. When you think you’ve got a terrifying moment figured out, Capcom twists it ever so slightly, removing any certainty as you slowly make your way through its carefully curated collection of memories. This is a remake designed to both terrify you in today’s horror landscape and scratch that nostalgic itch, and miraculously achieves both right until its breathless end. And even though multiple other Resident Evil remakes have arrived since, this remains the ultimate gold standard for video game remakes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s our pick of the 15 best video game remakes.

<p>Retro isometric puzzle sweetness incoming!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We really enjoyed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lumo">Lumo</a> when it launched on Switch back in 2017, awarding the isometric action-puzzler <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/lumo">an 8/10</a> and saying that it "provides a modern isometric platformer, offering (as you'd expect) improved audio-visual presentation over the classics of the genre, whilst still providing the same kind of entertainment."</p>
<p>Numskull has announced that the sequel, aptly named <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lumo_2">Lumo 2</a>, will launch on Switch on <strong>17th October</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, if you're around the same sort of age as this writer, you'll get a warm and fuzzy feeling inside whilst checking out the new trailer for the game (above), as just like its predecessor, Lumo 2 seems intent on reviving this lost-but-very-much-still-loved 'sub-genre' from an unnecessarily early grave. Yes, that's right, bring back the iso-action-puzzler, and do it this instant. Please.</p>
<p>Lumo 2 comes in both digital and physical flavours, with a deluxe physical edition rocking a soundtrack cassette and "other retro goodies", in an '80s-themed collector’s box. Digital will set you back <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Lumo-2-2897116.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq1-0-59adaTlVn8ka3KrESQM846ZPam5ryA_Iu2Cf9KUagzP3d">£19.99 / €22.99 / $24.99</a>, whereas the standard physical comes in at £34.99 / €39.99. And that snazzy collector's box is £49.99 / €59.99.</p>

<p>With plenty of nods to classics of the genre, and gaming culture of the period, there should be plenty to enjoy here when the game drops in a few weeks. For now, though, here's more from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lumo 2 is a love letter to the 8-bit era and to the Golden Age of British gaming – so expect collectibles galore and retro-inspired isometric visuals, all with the polished mechanics of a modern platformer.</p>
<p>In Lumo 2, players can experience:<br>
- Retro‑inspired puzzle platforming - A modern sequel built on the charm and artistry of early isometric British classics<br>
- Classic Collectibles - Collect 25 vintage cassettes and 20 ducks hidden in inventive locations, rewarding exploration and persistence<br>
- Evolving Gameplay - Traverse over 100 shifting dimensions and portals; mini-games and genre-bending levels surprise around every corner"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Have you played Lumo? Looking forward to the follow-up as much as us? Let us know!</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-windows-10-32-bit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-soon-lose-support-for-around-0-01-of-its-install-base.1301649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that Steam will soon stop supporting 32-bit Windows operating systems, but if you're worried that might mean you, don't fret: it almost certainly doesn't.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Valve says that it will end support for systems running 32-bit Windows instances on January 1st next year. Essentially, that means if you're somehow still running a 32-bit version of Windows 10, it won't be supported from New Year's Day.</p>

<p>However, Valve quickly qualifies this announcement by clarifying that according to its Steam Hardware Survey, this decision will only apply to around 0.01% of systems, so it's very unlikely that the end of 32-bit Windows support is going to affect you (although not impossible!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-windows-32-bit-support-ending.jpg?itok=irSUzJWX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-windows-32-bit-support-ending.jpg?itok=v3PUAVVp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Steam is ending support for 32-bit Windows instances, but that's a very small number of machines.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're still running Windows 10 and want to check whether or not you've got a 32-bit instance of the OS, all you need to do is head to the System menu, then About. You'll see whether you've got a 64-bit or 32-bit Windows version there.</p>

<p>Windows 11 users need not fret; there is no 32-bit version of Windows 11, so if you've already upgraded to Microsoft's latest operating system, then this move definitely won't affect you.</p>

<p>Valve says that even when support ends, Steam will continue to function on 32-bit Windows 10 machines, but updates and support will no longer be available, so if some critical flaw appears that renders Steam unusable on Windows 10's 32-bit version, you'll have no recourse.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why this is happening, Valve says it's because core Steam features "rely on system drivers and other libraries that are not supported on 32-bit versions of Windows".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/windows-10-32-bit-valve-support-ending.jpg?itok=0g_gtNf3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/windows-10-32-bit-valve-support-ending.jpg?itok=mwubss1A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Still running 32-bit Windows 10? It might be time to upgrade.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in Steam news, the app's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-age-verification-uk" rel="nofollow">age verification process recently kicked in</a> for UK users, requiring that valid credit card details be entered if players want to access adult content on the platform.</p>

<p>Prior to that, the storefront saw itself mired in controversy when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow">removed certain adult games</a> from its store, responding to pressure from payment processors (which also saw fellow digital storefront Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">make similar changes</a>).</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969"><i><span>Light of Motiram</span></i></a><span>, Tencent’s upcoming survival game, is the subject of a lawsuit from Sony, who calls the game a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>“slavish clone”</span></a><span> of its open-world RPG franchise </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><i><span>Horizon</span></i></a><span>. Looking at the two side-by-side, the comparison is pretty damning, it utilizes both the tribal, prehistoric aesthetic of </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and the roaming mechanical animals that have become synonymous with Guerrilla Games’ series. Now that Sony has served papers, Tencent is arguing that the PlayStation company is trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions, and that </span><i><span>Light of Motiram</span></i><span> looks like dozens of other games, actually.</span></p> <p><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/"><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i></a> <span>reports that Tencent has filed the motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that Sony is trying to use the power of the law to take a “well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it [the company’s] domain.”</span></p> <p><span>“Sony’s Complaint tellingly ignores these facts. Instead, it tries to transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets,” Tencent alleges. “By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>—like </span><i><span>Enslaved</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry: Primal</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry: New Dawn</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Outer Wilds</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Biomutant</span></i><span>, and many more—Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions.”</span></p> <p><span>You can read more about the arguments Tencent makes in </span><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i><span>’s write-up, but the summary is that the company argues that </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>isn’t as unique as Sony claims in the lawsuit. It even points to a statement made in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tLcD1r-6w"><i><span>NoClip</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>documentary</span></a><span> by Guerrilla art director Jan-Bart Van Beek indicating that the studio had its own reservations about the game’s originality, with Van Beek saying it seemed very similar in some ways to Ninja Theory’s 2010 action game </span><i><span>Enslaved</span></i><span>. Tencent also argues that the entire lawsuit is based on hypotheticals, as the game isn’t slated to launch until 2027, and thus might not look anything like </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span> by the time it launches. Tencent and </span><i><span>Light of Motiram </span></i><span>developer Polaris Quest </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608"><span>scrubbed the game’s Steam page</span></a><span> of images that featured a red-haired protagonist similar to Aloy from </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>last month.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silksong Devs Talk About Why The Game Feels Harder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-devs-difficulty-elden-ring-team-cherry-interview-2000626850</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong-devs-talk-about-why-the-game-feels-harder.1301634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> ratchets up everything from its predecessor. The world is bigger, more detailed, and more dangerous. Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen recently spoke about some of their thinking behind making the Metroidvania Soulslike sequel harder, and what players can do to navigate the higher difficulty.</p> <p>“Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight–so even the base level enemy had to be more complicated, more intelligent,” Gibson said during an interview at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ACMI Game Worlds</a> exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">according to reporting by <em>Dexerto</em></a><em>.</em> Even basic enemies in <em>Silksong</em> hit harder and can be much more aggressive. That’s because the hero Hornet is much more agile, and Team Cherry wanted to balance that out with more effective adversaries.</p> <p>“The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss,” Pellen added. “The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight’s enemies, Hornet’s enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away.”</p>

 <h2>If you keep dying, go somewhere else</h2> <p>That was essentially what Gibson’s advice seemed to be from the interview. He argued that <em>Silksong</em> is much less controlling than its predecessor when it comes to where the player can go and explore at various points in the game.&nbsp;“The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path,” he said. “So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes.”</p> <p>The logic is reminiscent of <em>Elden Ring</em> which, despite its punishing enemies and brutal boss fights, was arguably more inviting than previous FromSoftware Soulslikes because the open world allowed players to approach each challenge in unique ways. In addition to being able to grind additional levels, they could also explore off the beaten path until they found a weapon or spell that would tip the balance of power in their favor.</p>

 <p>“<em>Silksong</em> has some moments of steep difficulty–but part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you’re going and what you’re doing,” Gibson said, adding that players “have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled.”</p> <h2>A clash of design philosophies</h2> <p>There was recently a mini-debate about whether <em>Silksong</em> is actually harder than<em> Elden Ring</em>. <em>The Washington Post</em>‘s Gene Park <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/1968136044471324728">came down on the side that it is</a>. I would agree, though I think that’s in part because <em>Elden Ring</em> isn’t necessarily one of the harder games out there. <em>Elden Ring</em> is just a hard game that happened to sell over 30 million copies, meaning that its reputation is partly derived from tons of people who wouldn’t normally play a Soulslike actually giving it a try.</p>

 <p>Ryan Thompson, an assistant media studies professor at Michigan State, teased out <a href="https://x.com/BardicKnowledge/status/1968171985768460778?t=q0BLt1rfRLvioKYTgAnLMg&amp;s=19">what I thought was an interesting observation</a> about one of the core differences between<em> Silksong</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. It’s not just that one is a 2D side-scroller and the other is a 3D open-world RPG; it’s also the way the roots of those genres diverge. “3D games are designed for you to win eventually,” he argues. “2D platformers are originally designed to take your quarter and tell you to piss off.”</p> <p>That’s an oversimplification, but a helpful one when it comes to a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em>. As the genre name denotes, it has its feet in two related but distinct traditions. One is 8-bit action platformers of the NES era that seemed to be perfectly content if the kid they were sold to was never able to beat them. The other is a baroque RPG adventure in which the expectation is you’ll be able to level up or learn your way out of any challenge.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> is as much a 2D bullet hell game as a Metroidvania, maybe even more so. The margin for error on screen is more circumscribed than in its 3D counterparts, and its arsenal is more streamlined. It’s borrowing from <em>Castlevania III: Dracula</em>‘s<em> Curse</em> more than <em>Dark Souls</em>, and the result can be more uncompromising. That might be easier to accept if <em>Silksong</em> didn’t also tell an evocative and whimsical story that’s constantly dropping devilish obstacles in your path. But I’ll take that challenge over the original <em>Mega Man</em> any day.</p>
