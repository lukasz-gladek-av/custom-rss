The sale on Nintendo’s fancier version of its long-in-the-tooth Switch console runs until tonight at midnight ET or once Woot sells out. And it’s possible Woot will <em>not</em> run out of stock this time around because demand for a Switch is not what it used to be. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">sold so many Switch consoles</a> that it feels like everyone who wants one — and their parents — surely must own one by now.</p><div><p>It’s true that the Switch came out over <em>seven</em> years ago, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">a successor is confirmed by Nintendo to be announced by April 2025</a>. But even though the Switch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23473152/nintendo-switch-console-games-performance">feels pretty dated</a>, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth buying in 2024. There is a vast back catalog of games to pick from if you’ve never owned a Switch, and the OLED model with its excellent seven-inch screen is one of the best ways to enjoy them (if you prefer to play in portable / handheld mode). The Switch’s massive library includes games that now feel like institutions unto themselves, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953834/thats-a-lotta-mario-kart"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/28/23811665/masahiro-sakurai-smash-bros-without-me"><em>Super Smash Bros.

        <p>Cuts needed to ensure "a stable and sustainable future for the company"</p>

            <p>
Just Cause creators, Mad Max developers and Rage 2 co-developers Avalanche Studios have announced that they will lay off 50 developers - nine per cent of their global workforce - and close their New York, USA and Montreal, Canada studios in order to "ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company". 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/avalanche-studios-group-expands-to-montreal">announcement post</a> doesn't go into much detail about either the reasons for the layoffs or how exactly Avalanche will be supporting the departing staff, adding only that "our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time" and that "we're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players." 
</p>
<p>
Avalanche's Montreal studio had been open for all of eight months. The studio was founded in October 2023 after Avalanche acquired and integrated Monster Closet, who were themselves founded in 2021 by former developers of such headliners as Halo, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed.  Avalanche's New York studio, meanwhile, dates back to 2011. 
</p>
<p>
Avalanche as a whole turned 20 in 2023. Their current projects include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">Contraband for Xbox Game Studios</a> - an open world co-op game about smugglers with a focus on vehicular battling, set in the fictional Southeast Asian region of Bayan in the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
The layoffs follow hard on the heels of a unionisation agreement for Avalanche staff in Sweden. In April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">Avalanche entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish labour organisations Unionen and Engineers of Sweden</a>, with a view to "[standardising] frameworks around essential areas such as salaries, benefits, employee influence and career support". The deal will take effect in 2025, and Swedish Avalanche workers are now in the process of hashing out the specifics with management. It's not clear how, if at all, this relates to the decision to shutter the New York and Montreal offices.
</p>
<p>
The studio closures fit a larger pattern of games industry mass layoffs over the past year or two that have been widely attributed to a mixture of "overambitious" expansion during the lockdown gaming boom, technological innovations/gimmicks such as NFTs not paying off, general economic upheaval, and a desire for returns on investment that are increasingly hard to square with the sheer expense of developing a blockbuster videogame.</p>
<p>That's a very compressed summary that doesn't take into account how circumstances may vary between studios - Avalanche are not Microsoft, for example, who started the year by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">laying off almost 2000 people</a> after spending $68.7 billion on the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. As Alice B wrote at the time, "shrinking headcount is often one of the first things a business does when it has eaten a smaller, weaker one."</p>
<p>You can read more about the gutting of the games industry in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">my feature from this year's GDC</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/adventure-forge-hands-on-preview-the-power-of-creation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While games like Minecraft and Roblox made user-generated content games popular, this unique type of game, which relies on the user's creativity, is not new at all. From the classic RPG Maker series to Media Molecule's Little Big Planet series and the underappreciated Dreams and Super Mario Maker, players have had the chance to try their hands at game creation countless times.</p>
<p>None of these games, however, focused specifically on narrative-driven games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/adventure-forge-qa-with-jordan-weisman-unleashing-creators-with-a-no-code-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure Forge</a> does. The powerful tool created by Endless Adventure promises to change the world of user-generated content games by offering users everything they need to create complex narrative games without knowing how to code.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Adventure Forge platform, whose creation is led by Jordan Weissman, the man behind the Battletech and Shadowrun tabletop games, was developed to create a true game creator economy, eliminating the barriers to entry for aspiring creators. As such, it features no-code tools optimized for creating and innovating games within the narrative games genre, ranging from interactive fiction to visual novels, dating sims, and deep isometric RPGs. The tool will ship with four different Universes, which include all the assets required to create a full narrative experience, such as textures, character models, sounds, and so on. But the system is designed to allow the user to go wild with their creativity, as seen in some of the test games that will be available with the Steam Next Fest demo starting next week. Oni was developed during one of the game jams the developers held, and it features some unique visuals and different minigames that showcase the tool's versatility.</p>
<p>While the no-code tools offered by Adventure Forge streamline game development, they are still somewhat complex and require some time to understand. Thankfully, Endless Adventure will offer on the <a href="https://adventureforge.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> some quick and to the point tutorials to get started. These tutorials only cover the basics, such as creating isometric and 2D scenes and implementing conversations with multiple outcomes using the assets belonging to a few Universes, so it is up to the user to use these basics to create more complex narrative experiences. As such, the tool is relatively easy to use, as once I followed the tutorials, I had a decent understanding of how Adventure Forge works.</p>
<p>As such, in around 40 minutes or so, I was able to create a very short dialogue sequence set in a sci-fi world, complete with some basic exploration mechanics, a 2D dialogue sequence in a visual-novel style with multiple choices and different outcomes. It isn't anything complex, but the relative ease with which I could do so with absolutely no game-creation experience proves how everyone will be able to use Adventure Forge with some time and patience to create games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This simple sequence I created only scratched the surface of what Adventure Forge can do. Isometric scenes, for example, can be fully edited with custom-made locations, lighting, and events that can be triggered by interacting with specific tiles, such as dialogue sequences, camera changes, and so on. In 2D scenes, it is possible to control pretty much every aspect of the visual presentation, such as window placement, character states triggered by different dialogue choices, backgrounds, and so on. One amazing feature Adventure Forge comes with is the ability to test out single sequences on the fly, allowing the user to iterate their games with extreme ease. Coupled with the powerful audio and lighting tool, which grants the user more control over their creations, the possibilities are truly endless and likely even beyond what the developers thought possible.</p>
<p>During a recent presentation, the Adventure Forge development team showcased a project featuring a turn-based combat system created just using the current logic tools. While enemy AI had yet to be developed, and the interface was very basic, the development team was considerably impressed by what was achieved, which they did not think possible at the time. As such, it is clear how creativity will be the only limit when using Adventure Forge's powerful tools.</p>

<p>It is not yet known when Adventure Forge's early access version will be released, but soon enough, users will be able to try out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2466590/Adventure_Forge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> during the aforementioned Steam Next Fest, which will be held from June 10th to June 17th. The demo will also feature two narrative experiences created with Adventure Forge: the sci-fi story The Icarus Experiment and the fantasy world of Oni, which do an excellent job showcasing the possibilities offered by the tool created by Endless Adventure.</p>

<p id="YUfyPb">By completing <em>The Final Shape </em>campaign on Legendary difficulty, you will receive the following rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li id="UZs7Fv">Gear set fixed at 1960 <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23375994">Power level</a> (20 above the soft cap, 30 below the Powerful gear cap)</li>
<li id="Ayjx8g">Exotic armor</li>
</ul>
<p id="IUK2cP">As well as the above, like <em>The Witch Queen </em>and <em>Lightfall</em>, it’s also <strong>you’ll receive a second chest after each major campaign encounter</strong>, which will grant you additional loot to help get you to the soft cap faster — useful if you want to break away from the campaign at any point to play other activities.</p>
<p id="Z15JsV">In summary, by completing the Legendary campaign will give you a healthy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23375994">Power level</a> advantage, both from bonus rewards earned during each mission, and a fixed Power level set once the credits have rolled.</p>
<h2 id="H1EAMX"><strong>How difficult is the The Final Shape campaign, and can you play Legendary solo?</strong></h2>
<p id="6qmhrk">For solo players, these harder story missions are designed to <strong>scale with your Fireteam</strong> — meaning the difficulty will adjust to the number of players, allowing you to run the campaign solo if you choose.</p>
<p id="U0DCqa">The elephant in the room — whether you’re playing in a Fireteam or not — is the difficulty of the Legendary campaign for <em>Lightfall, </em>which was criticized by fans for being more difficult than <em>The Witch Queen</em>. The good news:<strong> The difficulty appears to have been scaled back </strong>— in part due to ‘raid-lite’ puzzles replacing demanding combat challenges.</p>
<p id="Bq40Dl">“I was able to solo the missions I played on the max difficulty without any real struggle, despite playing at a different mouse sensitivity than I’ve been aiming with for years,” explained service writer Ryan Gilliam in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164318/campaign-mechanics-raid-final-shape-interview-bungie">our hands-on preview with the campaign</a> ahead of release. “I’ve soloed the other Legendary campaigns as well, but there are some spikes in a few of those missions that had me sweating a bit, even in the comfort of my own home. It feels like Bungie has taken some of that combat difficulty and injected it into the puzzles instead — which is great for non-raiders, but might disappoint some endgame players.”</p>

<p id="ylEpM5">Even with the adjusted Legendary difficulty this time, it’s worth coming prepared with a build prepared to help you survive more challenging encounters. Hunters, for example, could consider using equipment and mods focused on boosting invisibility so you can hide from enemies to recover your shields.</p>
<p id="EdlxYW">For returning <em>Destiny 2 </em>players, it’s likely you’ll also have a range of crafted or god roll weapons and high-stat gear to give you the upper hand. <strong>For new players</strong>, the challenge of Legendary will be more significant without a decent loadout. If you cannot join other players who can help “carry” you through the campaign, it’s worth considering doing a Legendary run at a later time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-diablo-4-season-4-end-date-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>If you ask anyone currently playing Diablo 4 Season 4, they’ll likely tell you this is the best season to date. This is how the ARPG should have launched last year. It took some time to reach this point, but most of us remain pretty addicted to the core gameplay loop this time around. With good reason, too! It’s fantastic leveling a character to 100, but it’ll end soon. Here is what you should know about the Diablo 4 Season 4 end date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-diablo-4-season-4-end">When Does Diablo 4 Season 4 End?</h2>



<p>The Diablo 4 Season 4 <strong>end occurs on August 6, 2024</strong>. You still have another two months to enjoy the entirety of Season 4, and that’s enough time to level each class to level 100 multiple times over.</p>



<p>I know people who have leveled each class to max already, and now they’re just grinding The Pit for additional loot and bragging rights.</p>



<p>Personally, I’ve been playing rather casually this season due to other responsibilities, and I’m still at level 75 on my Barbarian. I cannot recommend this season enough!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-should-you-play-in-diablo-4-season-4">What Class Should You Play in Diablo 4 Season 4?</h2>



<p>While most classes will prove viable in Diablo 4 Season 4, a few stand a cut above the rest—namely, the <strong>Minion Necro</strong>, <strong>Dust Devil Barbarian</strong>, and <strong>Heartseeker Rogue</strong>. </p>



<p>As someone who plays Barbarian every season, I’m running a mixture of Upheaval and Charge. I’m having an absolute blast blowing through entire mobs in a mad dash forward alongside my ancestors. Follow up the initial charge with a flaming Upheaval that ignites the ground in front of you, and you will have a recipe for clearing areas quickly and spectacularly!</p>



<p>However, most people would recommend the Necromancer this season. They’ve received a significant buff to their minions, allowing players to clear dungeons while basically never lifting a finger off your movement controls.</p>

<p data-characters="240" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It looks like <em>Call of Duty</em> could reportedly be part of the the Esports World Cup. New data uncovered today indicates <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone </em>tournaments for a total prize pool worth almost $3 million may be hosted as part of the event.</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Dexerto’s Jacob Hale <a href="https://x.com/JakeHaleee/status/1798021527008678101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that lines of HTML were found on the tournament’s website, indicating that the Esports World Cup may host events for <em>Call of Duty</em> . According to the leaked image, the <em>Warzone </em>tournament would have a $1 million prize pool and runs from July 3 through 6. Meanwhile, the <em>MW3</em> portion would have a $1.8 million prize pool and takes place from August 15 through 18. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sources: Call of Duty could feature at the Esports World Cup, with tournaments in both MW3 and Warzone totalling an almost $3m prize pool.</p><p>These lines of HTML were found on the tournament's website this morning before being deleted &amp; I've verified with several sources. <a href="https://t.co/zPoYpHRO4p">pic.twitter.com/zPoYpHRO4p</a></p></div>— Jacob Hale (@JakeHaleee) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeHaleee/status/1798021527008678101?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="590" data-current-count="890" data-injectable="true">The 2024 Esports World Cup is a tournament series with the largest combined prize pool in esports history, totaling over $60 million. It features at least 20 events in 19 different titles. Originally, the Esports World Cup Foundation <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/sport/esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted a similar tournament</a> called Gamers8, but Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund stepped in and is taking over the competition for the first time this summer. 30 organizations from five different regions have already been confirmed as official participants, but the competition <a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received backlash</a> because of Saudi Arabia’s involvement. </p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty League </em>organizations 100 Thieves and FaZe Clan have already agreed to participate in the tournament, but it remains to be seen if other CDL teams will follow suit. As for <em>Warzone</em>, there are far fewer organizations involved, and in most cases, it will fall on individuals to decide if they want to compete or not. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Activision has not yet confirmed the dates for the latter stages of the World Series of Warzone. The qualifying stages take place from June 4 through 12. The Esports World Cup and <em>World Series of Warzone </em>are unlikely to overlap, but several teams will most likely compete in both competitions. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Meanwhile, the Call of Duty League Championship weekend runs from July 18 through 21. Usually, the regular roster shuffle starts after the final tournament of the year, as contracts expire and players are free to join other organizations. However, it’s possible that some teams will stay together if there’s another prize pool to compete for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-steam-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s–<em>finally</em>–a demo of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a> on Steam, the latest game by journalist-turned-game developer Tom Francis. Francis previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/206190/Gunpoint/?curator_clanid=32938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gunpoint</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/268130/Heat_Signature/?curator_clanid=32938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Heat Signature</em></a>, two very good games that I like a whole lot, and I am excited to report that <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> is also very good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The demo is pretty much what the title sounds like: you control a pair of wizards as they tactically breach areas and clear them of enemies. It’s got <em>XCOM</em> and <em>Invisible Inc</em> vibes in its turn-based combat and limited moves each turn, dictated by action points. Unlike those games, levels are contained to discrete series of rooms that make up campaigns, each with their own challenges and goals, as opposed to sprawling areas where you have to manage moving through a lot of space. Also unlike those games, your characters and some of the enemies are wizards, who use their magical abilities in service of somewhat mundane ends as detectives or mercenaries. In combat, this plays out in their unique abilities: in the demo, a character can chain shots together or give another character action points. These special abilities are refilled through mana that you access from intel found around the level, and which forces you to juggle multiple objectives as you make your way through a space.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tactical Breach Wizards trailer (PC Gaming Show 2022)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vgz6xzsle0o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before committing to a turn, you can use the “foresee” button to get a preview of how things will play out. In easier levels, I didn’t find this necessary, but it came in handy in a later encounter, where I found myself repeatedly rewinding and testing new strategies before I found the least bad one. Levels also feature optional challenges, which will earn you “confidence” that lets you change your character’s outfit.&nbsp;</p><p>Mechanically, all of this is fairly standard stuff for the turn-based genre, but <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>’ unusual setting and humor bring something unique. The combination of real-world and magic makes for some fun dialogue and set-ups (one enemy is a “traffic warlock,” which is a delightful concept). The character design reflects these contradictions in stuff like a character wearing camo wizard robes, or another sporting a witch hat and cliche rocker star tattoos. It’s a very funny game, with quippy dialogue and the ability to knock enemies out windows, which seems to be a staple of Francis’ games and which honestly never gets old. Given that Francis once wrote <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/2014-08-08-the-formula-for-an-episode-of-murder-she-wrote/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a blog post about <em>Murder She Wrote</em></a> that I still think is one of the funniest things on the internet, none of this surprises me.</p><figure><figcaption>Suspicious Developments</figcaption></figure><p>All of Francis’ games share a focus on how actions and their consequences can change a situation, and on finding creative ways to play the hand you’ve dealt yourself. In <em>Heat Signature</em>, this plays out in real-time action where things go wrong quickly; the slower, turn-based pace of <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> is a different, slower stage for making things go wrong and then finding ways to make them go right again. Judging by the demo, it feels like everything I was excited for it to be when it was first announced in 2019, and I’m psyched to play the full game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>At this point, it feels like every horror franchise of note has been made into an asymmetric multiplayer game or, at the very least, been fed to the genre-dominating beast that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a>. Perhaps because of this, IllFonic (a studio that’s tackled the likes of Friday the 13th, Predator, and Ghostbusters in the past) has had to dig pretty deep for their latest, dredging up <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killer Klowns from Outer Space</a>, a video store “classic” few have actually watched.</p>
<p>Killer Klowns from Outer Space may not be the hottest horror IP out there in 2024, but hey, it’s the gameplay that counts, right? Is IllFonic’s latest venture a barrel of laughs or begging for a pie to the face? Time to unpack this particular Klown car…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you’re expecting Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game to offer up any sort of deep worldbuilding, well, I’m afraid I have to dash your dreams. This game has no story mode and everything you need to know about the franchise is summed up by its title – there are Killer Klowns, they’re from space, the end. While most folks don’t expect much of a story from this type of game, it <em>is </em>disappointing that the game is rarely, if ever, funny. The original Killer Klowns movie isn’t high art, but it at least provides a few legit chuckles.</p>
<p>Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game offers your typical asymmetric multiplayer setup, albeit with a few tweaks. Instead of pitting a single killer against a group of survivors, this title opts for a 3v7 split between Klowns and humans, with the differences between the two sides not feeling quite as dramatic as in other games of this type. Each individual Klown isn’t too terribly overpowered and humans aren’t just helpless victims in waiting.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As a human, you’re dropped onto a map with nothing to your name, but you’ll quickly accumulate a variety of useful items, such as food and energy drinks to buff your abilities, balls, and other noise makers to distract the Klowns, and even weapons like bats, knives, and guns to fight back with. Humans are also generally the more agile of the two factions, with the ability to vault through windows and over obstacles to escape their floppy-shoed pursuers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Klowns are pokier and more awkward, but are pinged whenever a potential human victim makes noise by moving too fast, firing off weapons, or attempting certain tasks, like breaking down the gate blocking an escape route. Keeping quiet as a human and keeping your ears open as a Klown is central to this game. Klowns come to the battle with a loadout, including one of several melee weapons and a gun that can encase humans in a cotton candy cocoon. These cocoons, which are also found lying around the map, can be hooked to generators that spawn AI Klown lackeys to patrol the area. Klowns also have a number of abilities on cooldown timers that allow the player to, say, instantly jump to a different section of the map, lure opponents in, and even summon a human-sniffing balloon dog. Ultimately, though, perhaps the Klowns’ biggest advantage is that they respawn after being killed (you can be resurrected once as a human, but go down a second time, and you’re done for good).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Both sides have their own goals with humans having a variety of ways to escape the map (a boat, bunker, portal machine, and more) most of which only accommodate a portion of the seven survivors in a match. While it’s nice to have multiple paths to safety, most of the humans’ escape methods play out more or less the same – scavenge a couple of items (gas, spark plugs, keys, etc.) and take them to a designated location. More variety in the actual step-by-step process of escape would be appreciated.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the Klowns’ goal is simple – kill as many humans as possible before the match ends. You can do this by cocooning survivors, beating them down and performing a finishing move on them, or waiting for the Klownpocalypse to take them out. The Klownpocalypse is about what it sounds like – a big explosion that wipes out all remaining survivors when a match’s time limit expires, or Team Klown hooks enough cocoons.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the Klownpocalypse is a big advantage for our interdimensional jesters, IllFonic has done a fairly good job of balancing the game. For instance, humans have a lot of different ways to flee the map, <em>but</em> Klowns can coat escape routes with cotton candy, making getting away harder. As powerful as the Klownpocalypse is, a last-second escape route for the humans always opens up just before it hits. Also, even if you do die as a human, you can continue to play minigames in order to earn items you can gift to still-active players to help them survive. Granted, the Klowns won the majority of the games I played, but there are tons of mechanics, both big and small, that keep things fair, and with proper teamwork, the survivors can definitely come out on top.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At this point in the review, Killer Klowns from Outer Space may sound like a pretty solid asymmetric multiplayer game, and in terms of base mechanics and balance, it is. That said, this is a <em>very</em> crowded sub-genre at this point, so the question has to be, is Killer Klowns as good or better than other top games of this type? I’d be hard-pressed to say yes.</p>
<p>Compared to most of its competitors, playing as a killer in this game just doesn’t feel that exciting, although due to the 3v7 split, you get to do it fairly often. So, would you rather playing as a killer be a rare and exciting thing? Or a more common, yet less unique, experience? That will largely come down to individual taste, but speaking personally, I prefer the former.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFkillerklowns8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Beyond that question, Killer Klowns is pretty rough around the edges. Combat is unsatisfying, with ranged weapons being largely useless and melee battles just being frantic button-mashfests. The game’s visuals are ugly on both an aesthetic and technical level, and the audio is largely grating. Glitches, crashes, dropped games, and progress not being saved are all common occurrences.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqlVMqvo0hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of content. Killer Klowns from Outer Space serves up a sum total of five maps and a single game mode of launch. Those maps are a decent size and feature some randomization, but after only 4 or 5 hours, I felt I’d pretty much mastered them. I give IllFonic credit for not stuffing the game with microtransactions at launch, but with the lack of content on offer, $40 is a big ask, particularly given how thin the source material is. While IllFonic has vaguely promised some post-launch content is on the way, I question how many scarves they can pull out of their sleeves.</p>

<p>Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is a solidly-conceived asymmetric multiplayer horror game, but a lack of polish and content means it’s unlikely to become a long term go-to for most fans of the genre. There’s some quick and easy fun to be had with Killer Klowns, but a $40 entry fee and an uncertain future make these cheap laughs feel a bit overpriced.</p>

  <p id="9gWjSb">The virtual versions of <em>Talisman</em>, the board game developed by Games Workshop, have expanded into an extensive library of post-launch DLC since their 2014 launch. If you’re looking to jump into this amazing card-based RPG, you won’t find a better introduction than the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/polygon/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/talisman-complete-collection-returns?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_2_layout_type_threes_tile_index_2_c_talismancompletecollectionreturns_bundle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___pl__p_23935241__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/talisman-complete-collection-returns?hmb_source=\u0026hmb_medium=product_tile\u0026hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_2_layout_type_threes_tile_index_2_c_talismancompletecollectionreturns_bundle&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;hmb_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hmb_medium&quot;:&quot;product_tile&quot;,&quot;hmb_campaign&quot;:&quot;mosaic_section_1_layout_index_2_layout_type_threes_tile_index_2_c_talismancompletecollectionreturns_bundle&quot;,&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23935241__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Talisman Complete Collection</a>. This $10 bundle from Humble brings together the base versions of <em>Talisman Digital Edition</em> and <em>Talisman: Origins </em>along with a comprehensive collection of their corresponding DLC <em>— </em>valued at $162 if you were to buy everything separately.</p>

<p id="ViUIYJ">The tabletop version of <em>Talisman</em> is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24159225/talisman-5th-edition-pre-orders">returning with a fifth edition later this summer</a>, with a virtual adaptation currently in development, making this a fantastic opportunity to give this legendary dungeon crawler a try.</p>
<p id="gE9LhE">This bundle features 49 individual pieces of DLC for <em>Talisman Digital Edition</em>, including expansions, legendary decks, and character packs. While Talisman Digital Edition is designed to be played against human opponents, this bundle also includes a copy of <em>Talisman Origins</em> and its three expansions, which offers a more robust single-player experience.</p>
<p id="BRcbOS">Just like other Humble Bundles, a portion of each sale will benefit a nonprofit — in this case, BuildOn, a foundation that helps fund after-school programs in the U.S. and builds schools in developing countries. Just remember you can always use the “Adjust Donation” drop-down menu to choose how much of your payment goes to the publisher, the charity in question, and Humble.</p>

Those posts are some of the most comprehensive information about the event we have thus far. A specific issue she cited was that the event organizers filmed people in the designated rest area for social media. Pokéverse’s official account responded to the criticisms saying that, as this was the first iteration of the Pokéverse event, it agreed any future shows would need to be improved. However, they have not removed the videos from the rest area as requested and instead took down videos of contest winners performing the Pokémon theme song.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Hi BintuRita we apologise for the oversight we are investigating the matters with the production the team.</p><p>The organisers have been very busy with post production but have said will reach out to you personally to make sure your concerns are addressed.</p><p>It’s our first event with very little time to prepare but we do agree that better that a lot of things need to be improved for another season but we appreciate your participation and will continue take your feedback to do better next time.</p><p>Please DM us privately as we did have your prize bags available on the day and was suppose to be given to you after the performance and we will have it delivered to you this week.</p><p>We have taken down the PokéSinger video as well for the time being to investigate further.</p><p>But we really appreciate you for being part of the event and we hope to excite better for another one.”</p></blockquote><p>We’ve reached out to Pokéverse for a comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation Plus Essential Games for June have arrived, here’s more details and the Days of Play benefits!</p>



<p>June has kicked off, which means a new month of free games for PlayStation Plus Essential members. According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-free-ps-plus-games-for-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, players can now claim SpongeBob: SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever and Streets of Rage 4 and add them to their library. Additionally, EA Sports FC 24 will be extending its run in the monthly games category and will be available to claim until June 18, 2024. All you need to claim these games is PlayStation Plus Essential membership, which starts at <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$9.99 per month</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a 3D platforming adventure developed by Purple Lamp and published by THQ Nordic. The story has you playing as SpongeBob with your trusty companion, Patrick as you explore different Wishworlds. Next, we have AEW Fight Forever, a 3D wrestling game from YUKE’s and THQ Nordic. In this game, you experience nostalgic arcade wrestling with different types of fighters, game modes, weapons and more. Lastly, we have a 2D beat ‘em up by the hands of Dotemu, called Streets of Rage 4. Streets of Rage 4 is an exciting instalment to the series as it improves the classic gameplay with new mechanics, impresses visually with hand-drawn visuals and has a soundtrack that you will not forget.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-expansion-is-out-august-20-adds-new-raid-player-housing-and-land-spears/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet has unveiled Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds, the fifth expansion (following Secrets of the Obscure, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-midnight-king-the-final-content-update-for-guild-wars-2-secrets-of-the-obscure-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got its final content update</a> for the MMORPG originally released in 2012.</p>
<p>Janthir Wilds will be released on August 20, priced at $24.99, with <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/en-us/janthir-wilds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-orders open now</a>. Bonus<br>
items include a Serpent’s Wrath weapon set, the Whispering Serpent Pauldrons shoulder armor, the Homesteader character title, a shared inventory slot, and a level 80 character boost. The Deluxe Edition is priced at $49.99 and comes with the standard edition bundle plus another batch of exclusive items: the Wayfinder’s Versatile Table, a set of Eldritch Gathering Tools, an additional character slot, and an Identity Repair Kit. Finally, the Janthir Wilds Ultimate Edition ($74.99) includes the exclusive Standard and Deluxe Edition items, plus 4,000 Gems, the premium in-game store currency.</p>
<p>Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will add several new features and content, such as proper player housing called Homesteads, which will feature a brand new customization and decorating interface so that heroes may create and adorn their very own housing space for their friends and guild mates.</p>
<p>The expansion also adds the first new endgame PvE Raid to Guild Wars 2 since 2019, featuring challenging boss battles. On August 20, two new explorable maps will be available: the bucolic Lowland Shore and the stormy Janthir Syntri. A third will follow in future updates.</p>
<p>All professions (classes) will also finally get the chance to wield land spears. This new weapon type will be available during a limited time beta test between June 27 and 30. The Warclaw mount will also break out of PvP's World vs. World mode to join the player's mount stables as a new option for exploring the mountains and river valleys of Janthir, using its unique double-jump ability to navigate difficult terrain. Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will also feature Titans, vaguely described as mysterious magical beings native to the land. They can channel the energy of the land itself.</p>
<p>Players looking for new legendary items to farm will find a spear and backpack item, along with a variety of new non-legendary armor and weapon sets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds - Expansion Announcement - UK" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/57pu8v_FPfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Josh Davis, Guild Wars 2 Game Director, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>From the beginning we wanted to bring together many of the items that have been on both our and the community’s wishlist for years. Janthir Wilds is proof of our commitment to continue to surprise and delight while improving the Guild Wars 2 gameplay experience in unexpected ways, and to support game modes for both the cooperative and competitive communities.</em></p>
<p>ArenaNet also announced that Guild Wars 2 is coming to the Epic Games Store (after launching on Steam) later this Summer.</p>

  <p id="FCgDHc"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23603142/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-jk-rowling-transphobic-ps5-pc-xbox"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a> is getting a substantial free update this week, more than a year after the game set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter debuted on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Developer Avalanche Software will release its summer 2024 update on all platforms on June 6 — here’s what <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> owners can expect. </p>
<p id="PJ7OT3">The biggest new addition to <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is photo mode, which will let players take customized screenshots of their gameplay. The game’s new photo mode looks like what we’ve come to expect from other games with similar features, letting players snap pics and apply various effects, including frames and filters inspired by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/hogwarts-legacy-guide/23581208/house-sorting-quiz-test-gryffindor-slytherin-ravenclaw-hufflepuff-daring-curiosity-ambition-loyalty">Hogwarts’ famous houses</a>. You can put your young wizard or witch in various poses — including <em>sitting</em> — and change time of day and seasons for photos.</p>
<p id="LmA16m">A new quality of life feature will let players easily reset talent points from the Field Guide, but at the cost of 200 in-game gold per talent point. </p>
<p id="FV03HN">And for players who want to see and do it all, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352072/hogwarts-legacy-ps5-exclusive-mission-quest">Haunted Hogsmeade Shop quest</a> and its rewards will become available for all players of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. Previously, that quest was a PlayStation platform exclusive.</p>
<p id="ecri12">Avalanche Software is unlocking other exclusives as well: The onyx Hippogriff mount, previously a pre-order exclusive cosmetic item, will be available to all players, as will the Felix Felicis potion recipe, another PlayStation exclusive. The update will also give players some new cosmetics, including the Azkaban coat and prisoner’s outfit, and taped-up spectacles.</p>
<p id="5x75On"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is available on Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</p>

This might lead you to try all sorts of wild maneuvers to uncover what these mysterious locations mean. Trust me, do <em>not </em>bother taking the M.

<p>As someone who genuinely enjoys lengthy role-playing games, even those with a bit of grind, I cannot wait to see more about Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. I adore Inquisition, as do many of you, and it’s high time we receive a direct sequel. But will we see Dragon Age: Dreadwolf at Summer Game Fest?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-dragon-age-dreadwolf-reveal">When is the Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Reveal?</h2>



<p>According to insider reports, which we’re working to corroborate, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will receive a full reveal this week, likely during Summer Game Fest. Whether it happens during the Summer Game Fest Showcase, Xbox Games Showcase, or elsewhere, however, remains to be seen.</p>



<p>According to the report, the game will be unveiled in Summer 2024. It makes the most sense to showcase the open-world RPG at SGF 2024!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-dragon-age-dreadwolf-have-a-release-date">Does Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Have a Release Date?</h2>



<p>We don’t yet have a full unveiling, so there’s no official Dragon Age: Dreadwolf release date. However, Insider Gaming received reports regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-reportedly-launch-by-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch by March 2025</a>. We’ve previously heard the RPG will launch sometime this year, but an early 2025 release date seems more likely and appealing for EA to focus on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf-a-direct-sequel">Is Dragon Age: Dreadwolf a Direct Sequel?</h2>



<p>Yes! It’s been revealed that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the fourth game in the long-running RPG franchise, is a direct sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition. Players will take on the role of a hero, likely with full customization like in Inquisition, as we fight to stop Solas from ripping a hole in the Veil.</p>

Players will be able increase their power by seeking out minor bosses and defeating them, so this will be an additional factor to consider besides your level when entering the Land of Shadow.</p><p>If you're keen on saving a few extra dollars elsewhere, we also have a slew of other gaming deals roundups worth checking out, including the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">best Xbox deals</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals">best PlayStation deals</a>, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals</a>.

They are mostly friendly though, and with a bit of skill you can charm them to join your flock.</p><p>As your flock grows and your sheep get woolier, you can use the wool you shear from them for hats, cardigans, even socks!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Will you find all the creatures? Even the super rare and elusive ones? Will you keep them to yourself or share them with your friends? Will you knit the longest scarf ever seen? Will you find the fabled Golden Bewl?</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="FLOCK | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAOqkpvly2s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developed by XR Games in collaboration with IO Interactive, Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded also brings some John Woo energy to the mix, as you'll be able to dual-wield guns for the first time.</p><p>XR Games says this will add a new dimension to the strategic gameplay of Hitman, and as seen in the debut trailer, you can can swiftly assassinate two enemies at the same time with a pair of 47's signature Silverballer pistols.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCpv3XuxTL8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qCpv3XuxTL8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Other changes include a brand-new cel-shaded art style, environments enhanced with more interactive elements, an overhauled user interface for VR, and improved movement options to make it easier to weave through environments. XR Games added that it has also implemented visual enhancements and refined gameplay mechanics amongst many other tweaks to Hitman 3.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Hitman 3 has been adapted for VR--it's playable in this mode on PS4, PS5 via backward compatibility, and PC--but this appears to be a more focused approach to creating a more immersive version of the game. The game is now available to <a href="http://bit.ly/hitman-3-vr-meta-horizon-store" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder on the Meta Horizon Store</a> ahead of its Summer 2024 launch, and interested players can grab a 10% discount as part of an early bird special.</p><p>IO Interactive is making a new James Bond game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-hires-ubisoft-veteran-for-new-james-bond-game-and-hes-excited-to-work-on-a-non-sequel/1100-6522538/" data-ref-id="1100-6522538">and has hired Ubisoft veteran Rodrigo Santoro</a> be the Missions Director on the project.

"However, the industry’s unprecedented popularity has also led to unprecedented competition."</p><p dir="ltr">"To pursue this clarified vision, Behaviour will implement multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure, improving the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources," the post continued, adding that the aforementioned "strategic changes" include laying off "up to 95 employees." Behaviour Interactive's Montreal studio seems to have been hit the hardest, with 70 employees being removed from their posts.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement stated that the development of the studio's biggest IP, Dead By Daylight, will not be affected by the reduction in staff.</p><p dir="ltr">"I would like to express my deep personal appreciation for any employee affected by today’s changes," co-founder and CEO Rémi Racine said of the layoffs. "While changes to our structure and strategic vision have led to challenging decisions, we are confident that these decisions will position us for continued success. As we begin the next phase of Behaviour’s growth, our commitment to excellence in our products and workplace culture remains steadfast."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">Layoffs in the gaming industry are at an all-time high</a>, and the announcement of Behaviour's layoffs comes just a day after Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios revealed it would be closing two studios--including its Montreal location, which had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-cause-developer-closing-two-studios-including-one-thats-only-been-open-since-october/1100-6523899/">only been open for eight months</a>.</p>

                <p>If you don't live near an Ikea, we've got good news: The furniture outlet is bringing its many charms to Roblox. Ikea is launching <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-is-opening-a-new-store-on-roblox-pub8a9272d0" rel="nofollow ">a virtual experience</a> called "The Co-Worker Game" that aims to simulate the experience of working in one of its real-life stores, complete with paid co-worker roles that the company will begin hiring for later in June.</p><p dir="ltr">To work at this virtual Ikea, you must reside in the UK or Ireland and you have to be 18 or older. Employees will be paid 13.15 GBP per hour, which is apparently the standard pay for a London Ikea co-worker. Applications for these roles opened on June 3 and will close on June 16. The announcement claims that this is the first instance of paid work from a major brand on Roblox as a platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312770-coworker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312770" data-ratio="0.72110552763819" data-width="796" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312770-coworker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312770"></a><figcaption>A look inside the virtual Ikea.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312770-coworker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The virtual Ikea store launches on June 24, and it'll allow players to explore and redecorate Ikea showrooms, while also stopping for some of its famous Swedish meatballs at the food market and bistro. Players can also win exclusive Ikea-themed cosmetics and other user-generated content.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Roblox news, studio head Stefano Corazza <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-boss-talks-teens-making-money-on-the-game-disputes-exploitation-claims/1100-6522420/">recently stated</a> that the "majority" of those making money on the platform are 18 or older. He also said that the company has hired teenage developers that had "millions of players" on their content, and those developers didn't feel "exploited."</p>

The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.</p>

<p>Heart Machine is currently working on <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/31/heart-machine-announces-hyper-light-breaker-enters-early-access-in-2023">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver's teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine's logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.</p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>UI/UX&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>GENERAL</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>GAMEPLAY AND INVESTMENT&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>ABILITIES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All Subclasses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All Super abilities now use the same damage-based recharge parameters.
<ul>
<li>Previously, energy gained through damage dealt and received was scaled based on the passive recharge rate of the Super, resulting in a broader delta between long-recharge Supers and short-recharge Supers than intended.</li>
<li>This will, for example, bring the real-world uptime of Ward of Dawn and Well of Radiance closer to the uptime of a Super like Arc Staff or Fists of Havoc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arc Subclasses</strong></p>

<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Touch of Thunder
<ul>
<li>Lightning Grenade:
<ul>
<li>Now applies Jolt after the first damage event, rather than prior.</li>
<li>This means that the Jolt won’t instantly pop on application, and attackers will need to either wait for the second lightning burst from the grenade or deal additional damage via other means to trigger the Jolt’s chain lightning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Stormcaller
<ul>
<li>Lightning Surge

</ul>
</li>
<li>Ball Lightning
<ul>
<li>Increased the final arming shape size by 30%.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the arming shape was offset upward, higher than the maximum damage range of the projectile’s detonation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chain Lightning
<ul>
<li>Increased secondary chain projectile’s base damage from 27 to 54.</li>

<p><strong>Solar Subclasses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solar General
<ul>
<li>Restoration
<ul>
<li>Restoration’s full-body visual effects now reduce their intensity while the player’s Super is active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cure
<ul>
<li>Cure’s healing now takes place over 0.1 seconds rather than instantly.
<ul>
<li>This change is unlikely to affect Cure’s efficacy in a meaningful way but is primarily intended to improve the readability of Cure’s heal in the middle of combat in the UI.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Hammer of Sol
<ul>
<li>Increased projectile submunition count when Sol Invictus is not equipped as follows:
<ul>
<li>If the projectile detonates within the first 0.7 seconds of its lifetime, it now creates 4 shrapnel submunitions, up from 3.</li>
<li>If the projectile detonates after the first 0.7 seconds of its lifetime, it now creates 6 shrapnel, up from 5.</li>

<ul>
<li>Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn dome remains roughly the same as it was before vs. PvE combatants.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>No longer provides Weapons of Light by default. This behavior has been moved to the benefits of Helm of Saint-14.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Void Grenades
<ul>
<li>Suppressor Grenade
<ul>
<li>Damage radius now matches Suppression radius.</li>
<li>This does not meaningfully change the damage profile of the grenade but is intended to provide additional feedback to the player when they have successfully Suppressed a target.</li>

</ul>
</li>

            <p>
Hitman 3 is headed to Meta Quest 3 via a VR version that adds dual-wielding, and features a new cel-shaded art style.
</p>
<p>
Officially titled as Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, the project is being worked on by Leeds-based studio XR Games in collaboration with original developer IO Interactive. 
</p>
<p>
Its addition of dual-wielding is a first for the rebooted Hitman series, allowing you to hold two weapons or items at the same time for some intriguing new quick-fire possibilities.

<p>
The game's world is said to offer a "new layer of realism" so you can wander around picking up and smashing objects to your heart's content. And there's a new cel-shaded visual style - which reminds me a little of XIII.
</p>
<p>
"We knew the Hitman audience demanded the absolute best VR experience, and only the Meta Quest 3 could power such large environments, dense crowds and emergent sandbox gameplay,"  said XR Games boss Bobby Thandi. 
</p>
<p>
"With dual-wielding, a stunning new art-style, new features and improvements, we believe Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded will set a new standard for bringing AAA franchises to Meta Quest."
</p>
<p>
Originally launched in 2021, Hitman 3 brought IO's World of Assassination trilogy to a close. The studio is now working on two new projects - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">secretive fantasy game</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">a new 007 James Bond blockbuster</a>.

<p id="Xe2Hlc">Prismatic is probably the wildest addition to Destiny in the franchise’s history. Normally, Guardians choose what element they want to play as on their particular class and that’s their Subclass. Every ability deals damage (Arc, Strand, Solar, etc.) until they change to a different element. Prismatic turns all of that on its head by allowing Guardians to combine abilities from multiple elements at once, allowing players to equip an Arc Aspect, a Strand Aspect, a Void grenade, a Stasis Super, or any other combination of elements.</p>
<p id="A9MIW4">That’s all great, but the real kicker there is Transcendence, which is a kind of bonus Super players can get by dealing Dark and Light damage in equal measure. When activating Transcendence, Guardians will gain bonus weapon damage, bonus ability charge rate, and a brand new grenade that’s exclusive to their class.</p>

<p id="LgZP2b">In addition to Prismatic, each class is also getting a new Super and a new Aspect for one of their Light subclasses. Titans are getting Twilight Arsenal — which lets them throw massive axes that their teammates can pick up. Hunters are getting Storm’s Edge, a kind of teleporting knife twirl. And Warlocks are getting Song of Flame, which supercharges their normal Solar abilities.</p>
<p id="LHkTPH">These new Supers are available in the base forms of the Light subclasses they belong to, and Prismatic.</p>

These new Exotics let Guardians combine perks from two Exotics into a single item. They’re randomly rolled and will come from a mysterious activity that takes place somewhere inside The Pale Heart.</p>

<p id="2xBGJq">After years of players waiting and complaining, Bungie is finally giving Guardians a truly new race: the Dread. These Darkness enemies have some unique combatants — like the Grim, which Bungie’s own devs refer to as “gun bats” — and enemies that can give Guardians a taste of their own medicine with Strand and Stasis.</p>
<p id="aCQSy8">These new combatants join forces with The Hive and a variety of other enemy types to ensure The Pale Heart is packed full of stuff for Guardians to kill.</p>

But in addition to some truly wild newbies — like Still Hunt, a sniper that very literally shoots Golden Gun shots — there are a couple returning faces getting a big glow up. </p>
<p id="UNPhct">The first gun Guardians ever pick up in the Cosmodrome, Khvostov, is finally back as an Exotic in <em>Destiny 2</em>. And despite having already been reimagined as the hand cannon Crimson back in 2018, the Red Death pulse rifle is also back with <em>The Final Shape</em>. </p>

<p id="33nsae">Destiny has been around for 10 years now, and while the series certainly wasn’t known for its story in the beginning, the narrative team has really turned it around in the past few years. Now, as Guardians step up to face The Witness, Bungie is promising an answer to questions players have had for a decade, as well as a satisfying conclusion. </p>
<p id="VR1EY5">However, <em>The Final Shape</em> is not the end for <em>Destiny 2</em> or Destiny — despite the feeling the name conjures. Instead, <em>Destiny 2</em> will continue on with a new kind of content delivery system, detailed below.</p>

<p id="UAkhR8">Episodes are Bungie’s reimagined seasons. Instead of four different seasons per year that dole the game out into mini chunks every Tuesday, there will only be three episodes per year that focus on more direct content drops. Each episode is broken up into three distinct acts, each lasting six weeks. Every time a new act comes out, Guardians will get new story, quests, activities, weapons, and even artifacts to play with. </p>
<p id="tAeF4l">The idea here is to ensure Destiny feels both consistent and less formulaic than seasons.</p>

<p id="wN0th9">Finally, one of the more exciting changes for players looking to bring their friends in <em>Destiny 2</em> is Fireteam Power and the leveling changes. With <em>The Final Shape</em>, Guardians will be able to share their Power with Fireteam members of a lower level in most activities. The Guardian with the highest Power will be anointed the leader of the group, and everyone else will be brought up to the leader’s Power minus five. This allows anyone to drag their friends through some of the game’s best content without needing to have that awkward “we have to get your Power up first” conversation.</p>
<p id="y5kwID">This change comes paired with sweeping fixes to how Bungie assigns difficulty to activities. Only certain activities, like raids, will use Power anymore. Other activities, like the campaigns, will have a fixed difficulty, meaning Guardians can’t over- or under-level it.</p>

<ul>
<li id="5ohStP">All Super abilities now use the same damage-based recharge parameters.</li>
<li id="OxlGAt">Previously, energy gained through damage dealt and received was scaled based on the passive recharge rate of the Super, resulting in a broader delta between long-recharge Supers and short-recharge Supers than intended.</li>
<li id="ESuwiz">This will, for example, bring the real-world uptime of Ward of Dawn and Well of Radiance closer to the uptime of a Super like Arc Staff or Fists of Havoc.</li>

<p id="ReZz52">Lightning Grenade:</p>
<ul>
<li id="GpkEmd">Now applies Jolt after the first damage event, rather than prior.</li>
<li id="xyOTYr">This means that the Jolt won’t instantly pop on application, and attackers will need to either wait for the second lightning burst from the grenade or deal additional damage via other means to trigger the Jolt’s chain lightning.</li>
</ul>
<p id="nnWIkU">Storm Grenade:</p>

</ul>
<p id="KvAzQM">Ball Lightning</p>
<ul>

<p id="MHXdio">Cure</p>
<ul>
<li id="YhoC9D">Cure’s healing now takes place over 0.1 seconds rather than instantly.</li>
