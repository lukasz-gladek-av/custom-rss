            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spire-of-dioronna-card-game-based-on-3-body-problem-now-live-on-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A S<em>pire of Dioronna</em> board game has gone live on Kickstarter. This card game is based on the <em>3 Body Problem</em> novel series written by Liu Cixin, which was recently given a streaming series adaptation on Netflix. Specifically, it focuses on a single character from those books.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <em>Spire of Dioronna </em>is a modular map escape card game. It is based on Dioronna, a <em>3 Body Problem: Death's End</em> character. Dioronna was a prostitute in the time of the Byzantine Empire who, through the aid of a high-dimensional fragment, attempted to help Constantine kill the leader of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

In addition, the spire in the school may be the same one where Dioronna practiced her craft. But once you and your fellow students enter the spire the items and the room shatter apart.</p>

<p>If you want to escape this predicament, you must work together. Players take turns drawing room cards from a deck and slowly building a map. The objective is to find three unique magic items, a wizard hat, a cat, and a key, then find the exit. <em>Spire of Dioronna</em> is designed for 2-4 players and a single game takes about 20-40 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>There are several pledge tiers for <em>Spire of Dioronna</em>. The different pledge tiers are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Early Bird for $29:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game at a reduced price. This tier is limited and is available on a first-come-first-serve basis</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/planet-coaster-2-reviews-steam-worth-it-1851707808<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like most Frontier Developments’ games, including <em>Planet Zoo</em>, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> retains much of the charm and freedom that allow many players—though not me—to creatively construct a park that virtual visitors actually want to spend time and money exploring. Thankfully, alongside the freeform building mechanics, the game does feature a rather large suite of blueprints you can plop down easily. Even better is the slew of new mechanics, like procedural weather, waterparks, and more streamlined park management tools to help you run a bustling amusement park more efficiently.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,196358,195922" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On launch, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> managed to settle somewhere in the middle of the road, with “Mixed” reviews on Steam. Overall, the park management and simulation game is just shy of obtaining a “Mostly Positive” score, but there are a few hang-ups preventing players from leaning that way. First and foremost, it appears the game’s performance was lacking on release. I’ve encountered a few issues firsthand, primarily with guest AI refusing to queue up for a ride and instead forming a massive blockade.</p><p>Even amongst the game’s more positive reviews, however, most don’t attempt to hide the game’s various issues. The positive reviews point out performance troubles, UI issues are another problem and, above all else, AI woes. But for the most part, players seem happy with the depth and additional content over the last game. The waterparks, especially, prove entertaining. After spending a little time building a flume, I can see why. It’s a whole new layer to consider when designing your dream park!</p><p>As for the negative reviews, there are many. Most point to a half-finished experience rushed to release, the upcoming DLC practices that Frontier is known for, and frustrating performance. But most importantly, they indicate missing features, like Steam Workshop support and the lack of security and vandalism mechanics which were prevalent in the previous game. </p><p>If you’re on the fence about picking up<em> Planet Coaster 2</em>, here’s a look at the game’s Steam user reviews for more insight!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="f96111411f32796d3354da93fdc7bbd9"

<p>ASKA Major Update Three, known as Servers &amp; Roads, is now available on the stable branch for all fans of the third-person crafting survival game with town-building mechanics. It’s a big one, too. Alongside the inclusion of dedicated servers, update three features in-game text chat, graphical improvements, path-making mechanics, and so much more. It’s a huge boon to anyone still enjoying the survival game!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-aska-update-3-servers-amp-roads">Everything New in Aska Update 3 Servers &amp; Roads</h2>







<h3 id="h-dedicated-servers">Dedicated Servers</h3>



<p>You can now host and join dedicated servers in ASKA via a server application under the tools category in your Steam library. To launch a dedicated server, as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1898300/view/4464851103138187634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per the studio</a>, simply:</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-in-game-text-chat">In-Game Text Chat</h3>

Amazon's intriguing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Secret Level anthology series</a> is almost upon, bringing 15 episodes of brand-new stories set in familiar video game worlds. And following on from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-latest-secret-level-trailer-includes-sifu-megaman-spelunky-and-a-nightmarish-pac-man">recent series trailer</a>, Amazon is now releasing individual teasers for each episode, offering a closer look at the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, and, of course, that posthumous turn for Concord.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if it's so far managed to pass you by, comes from the creative team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>’s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots. Like that show, Secret Level is all about the flashy CGI animation, but here, episodes draw inspiration from existing video games - featuring familiar settings and characters in new adventures - rather than sci-fi tales.
</p>
<p>
Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, Spelunky, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40K, plus a number of PlayStation Studios games all feature in Secret Level's inaugural season, and we've seen brief glimpses of at least some of these already. However, as part of its big pre-release push, Amazon is now highlighting each individual episode on social media, publishing brisk 20-second-long teaser trailers revealing a little more than what's been shown before.

Concord, above, is arguably the most fascinating of these, if only because it effectively serves as an unanticipated eulogy for Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">ill-fated 5v5 shooter Concord</a> - in an episode Secret Level creator Tim Miller recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">showed the "potential of this world and the characters"</a>. But there's more too, with Amazon also sharing a look at <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1858533196943520132">The Queen's Cradle</a>, based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, as well as Sifu's <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1858895581684339092">It Takes a Life</a>, Unreal Tournament's <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859258173858709977">Xan</a>, the Spelunky themed <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859620355314213027">Tally</a>, plus <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859982744383590403">And They Shall Know No Fear</a> - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">sequel</a> to the events of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2.
</p><p>
You can see all Amazon's currently released teaser trailers by clicking on their episode titles above, and if you're left sufficiently intrigued, Secret Level - which stars the likes of Keanu Reeves, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Ariana Greenblatt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Clive Standen, and Laura Bailey - launches via Prime Video on 10th December.

Not only is the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finally launching on Nintendo Switch, but now fans can look forward to a new, official art book covering the original trilogy from premium game-guide publisher Piggyback.

The book will feature "concept drawings, sketches, and assorted illustrations" from the original Metroid Prime, Prime 2: Echoes, Prime 3: Corruption, and the recent Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch. The art is presented alongside "exclusive commentary from Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe, as well as the esteemed Retro Studios." Tanabe also contributed a foreword to the book and each section features written intros from Retro Studios staff. The hardcover book is printed on premium, sheet-fed art paper with stitch binding and etched metallic foil cover art featuring Samus Aran's iconic Varia suit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4405390-mptrilogyartbook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405390" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4405390-mptrilogyartbook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405390"></a><figcaption>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4405390-mptrilogyartbook.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Official Art and Making of Metroid Prime 1-3 will launch for $50 sometime in Summer 2025.

			<p>If you're dipping your toes into the <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular MOBA</a>, League of Legends, you'll notice that there are a few roles for you to try out in Summoner's Rift. If you want to try your hand at jungling, you'll need to get to grips with the best routes for clearing, how to gank your opponents, and how to shot call on essential things like taking the Dragon or doing Baron Nashor. However, before you can think about that, you need to choose a jungler. Here are some of the best junglers to choose from if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out more of our League of Legends guides here:</p>

<h2>Best Beginner Junglers in League of Legends</h2>
<p>Jungling can be quite tricky to get a handle on, especially as you are responsible for maintaining your health, mana and dealing enough damage to kill jungle camps efficiently on your own. On top of that, you have to juggle responsibilities such as warding, having a good lane presence, and overthrowing the enemy jungler. If you want to try your hand at being a jungler, here are some of the best for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Amumu</strong> is a great jungler to start with, regardless of what season it is. Not only does he have a lot of ganking capability, but he has a relatively smooth camp clear. Typically, with Amumu, you start at Raptors using your E so that you don't have to get a leash from either the top or bottom lane. This means that the lane that would be helping you doesn't miss out on vital early-game minions, and you can get your early-game camps with minimal issues. Amumu has great crowd control, with his Q stunning the enemy and pulling Amumu to the opponent, and his Ultimate stuns everyone who is in the circle.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Nocturne</strong> is incredibly fun and has the potential to snowball and hypercarry if you play him correctly. He can be a bit difficult to get to grips with, but he has a ton of potential. It would be best if you found the balance between getting farm and ganking lanes to be able to be a threat to the opponent. One of the keys to being able to be a good Nocturne is using your Ultimate to gank an ally and help them pick off their lane opponent. Getting those assists in any time your Ultimate is up is key.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sejuani</strong> also has a lot of potential this season and is relatively easy to learn. If you don't like the idea of being a squishy jungler, Sejuani is perfect to pick. She gets quite tanky and can survive team fights and lane ganks with ease, especially with the aid of her crowd control. Of course, like any jungler, you need to make sure you find the balance between farming and ganking. However, she has a lot of defensive options with her knockback, her Ultimate, and the slows that come with it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No matter the season,&nbsp;<strong>Vi</strong> remains viable. She has a lot of damage potential and is more of a bruiser than a tank jungler. She has great damage output and camp clear, with added mobility in her Q. With how her Ultimate and Q work, it makes it easy for Vi to gank a lane. However, due to the skill shot nature of her Q, it can be difficult to land the hit on a champion, especially if they move unpredictably. Despite that, Vi is a lot of fun and has great potential if she can get ahead.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best beginner junglers you can try out in League of Legends right now. Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>

There, you’ll encounter a handful of characters who will help propel the story forward, along with merchants, technicians, and even your first up close and personal interaction with a faction. You’ll also need money—well, coupons in this universe. You’ll find Mityay arguing with another Stalker in the merchant’s shop, and if you choose to accept his quest, he’ll send you to a dangerous anomaly field known as the Poppy Field. It’s gorgeous and deadly in equal measures.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h37281"><a id=""></a>‘The Poppy Field’ Walkthrough</h2><p>Mityay asks for your help retrieving a family religious icon left behind on their plot of land, buried in a root cellar beneath the Poppy Field. But he warns you about this area: It’s dangerous. The Poppy Field is a singular anomaly that forces Stalkers to fall asleep and never wake up. He suggests you bring along energy drinks, and you should. You’ll require approximately eight to survive the anomaly.</p><figure id="" data-id="758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-recommend-id="image://758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stalker Pomor hides out by the Poppy Field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Stalker Pomor hides out by the Poppy Field." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-recommend-id="image://758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stalker Pomor hides out by the Poppy Field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Upon arriving at The Poppy Field to the northwest of Zalissya, you’ll encounter a few mutants, but more importantly, a voice comes over the radio, urging you to meet them at the nearby house to the northeast of the field. Once there, you’ll encounter Pomor, a lone and mysterious Stalker who requests your help. He knows where to find the root cellar but requires your assistance entering the field. You can either pay him 2,000 coupons or help him recover the weapons and ammunition from multiple bodies marked within the field. If you choose the latter, you’ll need some energy drinks. You’ll need one to reach the body and then one to return. The last two drinks are for the root cellar. They’re mostly a precaution, though. Depending on how much you panic, you might only use one drink per body.</p><p>The final house at the southwest portion of the field contains two bodies, one in the central room and one in the rear bedroom, so don’t panic while you avoid the petals. Keep a clear head, search both bodies and then exit swiftly.</p><figure id="" data-id="78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-recommend-id="image://78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows Pomor’s tasks at The Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows Pomor’s tasks at The Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-recommend-id="image://78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows Pomor’s tasks at The Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s important to note that you don’t have to help Pomor, though. If you’d rather pay him, you can. Otherwise, you can walk back out and find the root cellar yourself. It’s located to the far west of The Poppy Field, out behind the two far buildings, near the edge of the anomaly.</p><p><strong>If you choose to help Pomor, you’ll unlock an additional path to complete this side quest, along with unique rewards. </strong></p><p>To summarize, your options include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Return the Icon to Mityay</strong>: In exchange for returning the religious icon to the original quest giver, Mityay, you’ll receive 1,000 coupons.</li><li><strong>Trade Pomor the Icon</strong>: If you trade Pomor the religious icon, you’ll receive the Unknown Stalker’s AR416. It’s a broken yet extremely powerful early-game weapon that will serve you well after you pay for repairs.</li><li><strong>Trade the Icon, Kill Pomor, Return to Mityay</strong>: Lastly, you can trade the religious icon to Pomor, receive the rifle as a reward, then turn around and shoot him to retrieve the icon and return it to Mityay for his reward. </li></ul><p>At the end of the day, this is the Zone. No one will judge you for double-crossing a shady Stalker you met out there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I often think about the era when Grand Theft Auto games were coming out almost every year rather than once a decade or so. In those off years, there were a lot of games that tried to fill the void for players wanting an open-world crime-drama game: True Crime, Saints Row, Mafia, Scarface, Crackdown--the list goes on. Presumably, no one making these games thought they would dethrone Rockstar. Still, they understood they could capitalize on the genre's popularity by giving players a new lookalike while Rockstar was busy cooking up the next GTA. Since 2017's Sniper Elite 4, I've viewed the Sniper Elite series as something similar, only in this case, the series it's filling in for is Hitman. Rebellion's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/" data-ref-id="5000-640579">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> won't outdo IO Interactive's incredible Hitman series, and it doesn't even seem to do much differently compared to the last few games in its own series, but if you've enjoyed this sort of game before and are eager for another one, Sniper Elite: Resistance looks to be a reliable proxy.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently played about 90 minutes of the game's third mission before its debut in January on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S, when it will also be a day-one Game Pass launch. Even as I strained to find much in the way of new experiences, I had a fun time. That suggests that this sixth game in the series, and the first since 2022, is roughly as enjoyable as the last couple of entries--at least from what I've seen so far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405385-ser_announcement_09_fort_c_sights.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405385-ser_announcement_09_fort_c_sights.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405385"></a><figcaption>Pictured: politics in games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405385-ser_announcement_09_fort_c_sights.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like Hitman, levels are huge and open-ended regarding where you can go and how you can complete your objectives when you get there. In recent sequels, Rebellion has built in more creative kills reminiscent of Agent 47's handiwork, such as hiding a grenade in wrapping paper for a target to unwrap, or killing Hitler with a bowling pin. Each mission includes a main objective and several optional objectives of a few different kinds. There are intel collectibles you can gather, ally hideouts to locate, things like enemy weapons depots to blow up, and usually a high-value target to snuff out, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The sandbox-style fun of it all is deciding how you do that, whether it's by sneaking past everyone and exfiltrating before anyone knew you were there, or going loud and aiming for the groins of every Nazi who comes into view of your scope. Some players will prefer to mainline the campaign, but I've long found Sniper Elite to be one of the better series at enticing me to clear each map of all its different mission markers, and as a stealth experience especially, I've always enjoyed the challenges they put in front of me.</p><p dir="ltr">Even with just 90 minutes to play the preview build of the game, I couldn't help but investigate every optional objective I came across. Once, when I was nearing the end of a main objective, I'd suddenly realized what I'd overlooked when seeking a secret ally hideout about an hour earlier in the level, so I ditched the elaborate Nazi mansion I was sneaking through, trekked all the way back to an earlier section past the dead fascists I'd left in my wake, to climb the side of a building using the drain pipe and some ledges so I could finally check that side quest off my list. Sniper Elite gives you a vast playground to explore, offers many viable routes through it, and doesn't punish you for handling it all in the order and manner of your choosing. In a world without Agent 47 for the foreseeable future, I'll gladly accept this Historical Hitman in his absence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405386-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_21b-%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405386" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405386-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_21b-%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405386"></a><figcaption>Sniper Elite's sharpshooting gameplay run deep, but its best attribute is its sprawling levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405386-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_21b-%281%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I've played all of these games, and though the next one to really blow me away would also be the first one, none have been bad. The studio seems to think better of its signature X-ray bullet cam than I do--in Sniper Elite 5, I eventually turned it off so it wouldn't keep slowing down my missions--but I'm still otherwise very much into the format of these games. Both level to level and game to game, they become a kind of even-keeled comfort-food experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Like cooking your favorite meal for the fourth time in a week, you know what you're getting with Sniper Elite. It may not dazzle you with new flavors that have never graced your tongue, but it's a reliable go-to when you don't know what to make for dinner that night. I don't mean to damn the game with faint praise; I sincerely enjoy these games and gladly try a new one every few years at their current pace.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say this sequel is totally void of new experiences. The broad strokes are certainly very familiar, but one aspect Rebellion is adding--which I didn't get to see in my time with the game so far--are Propaganda missions, which cast players as "resistance fighters," giving the game's massive levels more replayability in the form of new objectives on subsequent playthroughs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405389-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_16.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="7680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405389-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_16.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405389"></a><figcaption>The slow-motion X-ray camera isn't a selling point for me after so many entries, but the mechanics around it remain satisfying.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405389-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_16.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This will also be the first game in the series to cast a hero other than Karl Fairburne, the square-jawed alpha American, as the playable protagonist. Instead, it turns to Harry Hawker, a British soldier who has been in past games, but usually as the backup character for those playing the campaign in co-op. That will give this chapter in the story a different voice, but the lack of a number in this game's title and the fact that Hawker's story takes place at the same time as Fairburne's in Sniper Elite 5 also suggest this is overtly a continuation of what worked well before. Rebellion is keeping things in France for now rather than moving the series to a new country like sequels in this series have tended to. If Sniper Elite is the comfort food series, Resistance is like enjoying a second plate of what you scarfed down earlier. If you're still hungry, eat up.</p>

                <p>The biggest goal Epic Games has with Fortnite Creative is to transform Fortnite into a platform for games that share little to no resemblance with its core battle royale mode. Independent creators--while perhaps still a long ways off from making Creative's breakout game--have started to do just that.</p><p>Creator duuk has built a 10-player free-for-all <a href="https://fortnite.gg/island?code=9756-5951-6748" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Creative map</a> that replicates the beloved wallrunning mechanic of other first-person shooters such as the Titanfall series. The 19-year-old, Netherlands-based creator is one of the first to implement this type of mechanic in Fortnite Creative.</p><p>You can find the map by searching in the Discover tab with the following code: 9756-5951-6748.</p><p>Players are immediately shifted to a first-person point of view once they load into the map. They have the ability to practice the wallrunning mechanic in a small training area before loading into the full map, which resembles a warehouse lot.</p><p>The mechanic feels nowhere near as smooth or responsive as it does in games like Titanfall 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, although it's still an interesting experience to combine the wallrunning with other Fortnite mechanics like mantling and items like shockwave grenades.</p><p>Wallrunning has been rumored as an upcoming mechanic for Fortnite's battle royale mode for at least a year, as YouTube and TikTok videos have hinted that future chapters and seasons would include it to complement the mantling and climbing system. Despite the rumors, no wallrunning feature has ever been officially mentioned by Epic Games.</p><p>Movement has been one of Fortnite's most-enjoyable features as the battle royale development team has continued to iterate and build on the game's traversal mechanics with special items that give players incredible abilities. Players have been bounced off the ground with the Shockwave Hammer, dashed through the sky with the Kinetic Blade, and soared above the clouds Iron-Man gauntlets over previous seasons.</p><p>The base movement system within Fortnite's third-person mode has evolved over the course of the game's five chapters (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-start-date-battle-pass-skins-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-5955/" data-ref-id="2900-5955">Fortnite Chapter 6</a> launches soon). Previous updates have added and refined sprinting, mantling, climbing, and sliding mechanics that have transformed the shooter into something that looks nothing like the survival game that Fortnite originally launched as in 2017.</p><p>Many of the features found in the battle royale mode can be used by players in Creative, although copyright restrictions prevent things like the Spider-Man gauntlets from making the crossover without receiving a generic rebranding.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4405376-img_6014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405376" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4405376-img_6014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405376"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4405376-img_6014.jpg"></figure><p>We haven't seen many fluid movement mechanics in Creative, but players are beginning to push that boundary as well. This map is duuk's first full release, as they put it, within the Fortnite Creative ecosystem. Mechanics and game types tend to spread like wildfire in Creative if a map featuring them gets popular. It's too early to tell now, but both duuk and other creators could continue to refine wallrunning in future maps and updates.</p><p>Although wallrunning is the signature feature of duuk's map, it also distinguishes itself from the standard Fortnite experience through the aforementioned first-person perspective. While a first-person mode has been teased for battle royale in the past, an experimental mode only came to Creative users in <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-first-person-now-available-as-an-experimental-feature-in-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">October 2024</a>. The feature, as the experimental tag would suggest, is still in its early stages and does not include all weapons, use cases, and player features that Fortnite' standard third-person mode includes.</p><p>Fortnite Creative has been slowly evolving since Epic Games announced a new way to create with Unreal Editor for Fortnite, which expands creator tools through further integration with Unreal Engine. The ability to use different camera angles, including a top-down view, give creators an opportunity to build experiences that feel completely different from the battle royale mode. Wallrunning is a beloved game mechanic thanks to many shooters that have come before--these creators are adding to a short chapter to its history with this Creative map.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's no secret that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has been a massive success for Larian Studios. It won Game Of The Year at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2023-winners-revealed/2900-4977/">2023's The Game Awards</a>, and over a year after its initial launch, Larian is still pushing out game updates and gaining fans all over the globe (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mods-help-player-numbers-grow-and-someone-in-the-vatican-just-bought-a-copy/1100-6527834/">including in the Vatican</a>). But a recent report from the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dublin-firm-behind-baldurs-gate-game-posts-249m-profit-after-runaway-success/a2033961431.html" rel="nofollow ">Irish Independent</a> has revealed that the game wasn't just a hit with players--it was also a massive financial success, raking in roughly $260 million in profits in 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the figures shared by the Independent, Larian earned a total of $466 million in revenue in 2023, nearly 20 times what the studio earned in 2022. The massive success of Baldur's Gate 3 clearly had a major hand in the studio's financial success, and although Larian has yet to release the game's sales numbers, the Independent cites 15 million copies sold. 2023 marked a major change for the studio, which was operating at a $223,000 loss in 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the game's success is likely due to its sheer level of replayability. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/" data-ref-id="1100-6527513">Players can mod the game</a> to their heart's content (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-rolls-out-baldurs-gate-3-mod-limitations-for-console-players/1100-6528031/" data-ref-id="1100-6528031">even on console</a>) and play through the story as their own original player-character, or step into the shoes of the game's companions and play as one of them. For those looking to wreak havoc on Faerûn, there's the Dark Urge character origin option, and players who wish to bring others into their adventures can make use of the game's robust online multiplayer mode or split-screen couch co-op, all for a single $70 purchase. No microtransactions, no DLC, and seemingly infinite content might explain why the game now sees <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3-defies-the-laws-of-physics-by-being-a-single-player-rpg-with-more-daily-users-in-2024-than-its-release-year/" rel="nofollow ">more daily users in 2024 than it did in 2023</a>--an <em>extremely</em> rare occurrence when it comes to single-player RPGs.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the future, Larian CEO Swen Vincke says the studio has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/">no current plans to start work on Baldur's Gate 4</a> (for now), but the team behind the best RPG of 2023 is currently laying the groundwork for a new that Vincke says he hopes will take players by surprise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/">and "dwarf" Baldur's Gate 3</a> by comparison.</p><p>"Hopefully nobody's going to leak it for us, but it's different than what you think it is," Vincke <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-teases-next-game-and-discusses-decision-to-not-make-baldurs-gate-4/1100-6522165/">said of the untitled RPG</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/sony-in-early-stages-of-making-a-hand-held-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bloomberg are reporting that Sony are in the early stages of developing a portable console that will play PlayStation 5 games without streaming. According to the report that was the original plan for the PlayStation Portal, making it a direct competitor to Valve’s SteamDeck, but it was shelved in favour of the streaming only device.</p>
<p>Sony have had some success with hand held devices in to the past but has never managed to compete with Nintendo’s hand held offerings. The big question here is does anyone want a PS5 Portable? It’s going to be expensive, no doubt there, and they would be going up against mobile phone gaming. Nintendo’s Switch is portable but I honestly can’t remember the last time I saw someone using one on the commute to work,&nbsp; it is a big bulky device and for short trips everyone seems quite happy with a round of two of Candy Crush.</p>


<p>The device is said to be years away from release but many factors are in play and it may never become a real product.</p>
<p>A hand held PS5 does seem to be a very niche product but that does appear to be something Sony want to pursue, the PlayStation Portal and the PS5 Pro being current examples of that strategy.</p>
<p>Sony recently announced that the PlayStation Portal will begin<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/"> beta tests of streaming games from the PlayStation Plus catalogue</a>, rather from the users own PS5.</p>

<p>Sony’s last hand held device, the PS Vita, started strongly but support for it soon dropped off.&nbsp; Many of Sony’s key franchises had their own unique games on the console including Uncharted, Wipeout, Resistance Fall of Man, and Killzone, and while most of these were impressive the console also had some terrible exclusives, the PS Vita version of Call of Duty Black Ops was a universally derided. As the years rolled on many previously announced games such as Bioshock were quietly cancelled.</p>
<p>Would you buy a hand held PS5 and more importantly, how much are you willing to pay? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-dev-says-missable-content-is-core-to-what-makes-rpgs-special.1044987/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-dev-says-missable-content-is-core-to-what-makes-rpgs-special/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As we get closer to the release of Avowed, Obsidian Entertainment is sharing more tidbits about the game as well as what they think is core to the RPG genre. Speaking to Gamesradar, Obsidian's Region Director and Senior Area Designer Berto Ritger <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-dev-channels-baldurs-gate-3-by-admitting-that-the-core-of-rpgs-is-missable-content-that-most-players-might-not-ever-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that missable content is what makes them special, hinting that the same design guideline will apply to Avowed.</p>
<p><em>I think the core of RPGs that makes them special is missable content, to be honest, and it makes the experience feel so much more personal to how you play the game. If you talk to somebody like, 'Oh, I found this thing under the docks. There's this little secret under there on the eastern side of the docks that you can find. And you can also climb up to the top, and there's stuff up there.' But if you find that, and your friend doesn't, they found something else, and it creates a very interesting dialogue about the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to draw your attention to things that we want you to engage with. The lighthouse is very tall, and so everybody's going to see a big, tall thing and want to go climb. And so we want to support that as well. And you can do that, and you can jump off into the ocean if you like. And so we try to draw your attention that way.</em></p>
<p>During my recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>, I didn't exactly stumble upon lots of missable content. Then again, it was just the first area of the game, Dawnshore. That kind of stuff might be reserved for the latter areas. However, I did enjoy my time with Avowed:</p>
<p><em>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</em></p>
<p>The game launches on February 18, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-delay-is-due-to-hardware-limitations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you have been waiting to play Cities: Skylines 2 until it launches on console, you’re going to be waiting a bit longer. In an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/4486243201365051600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on Steam</a>, the game’s developer Colossal Order says that it still doesn’t have an update on a release date for the console version of the game on Xbox Series and PlayStation 5. </p>



<p>In its latest message to players, the developer says that while the game’s console release continues to be a “top priority”, its delay continues to be due to “hardware limitations” of the consoles themselves.</p>



<p>“Currently, we are experiencing both simulation issues (CPU) and graphics issues (GPU) which become noticeable when players take certain actions that cause frame rate drops or memory overload,” they said. “These issues are particularly challenging due to the hardware limitations of consoles.”</p>



<p>They then continued with an example of one issue consoles pose, saying, “When placing larger buildings that involve numerous entities, the system struggles to handle the data load. During the calculation process (e.g., checking if there’s enough space or if any entities overlap with existing assets), performance bottlenecks arise, resulting in these noticeable issues.”</p>



<p>The studio says they’ve gotten the game to a “playable state” by lowering the overall graphics quality “significantly”, but it brings it to a level of compromise that they “are not willing to make”.</p>



<p>“Once we get it to an acceptable level, further optimizations are needed for both simulation and memory usage before we are ready to share the console version,” they said. “Until they are resolved, we cannot provide a release estimate to avoid it being premature and potentially misleading. The console release remains a top priority for us, we have multiple solutions being explored with experts actively involved, and we’re working hard to bring you the console version of Cities: Skylines II.”</p>



<p>Cities: Skylines 2 was originally supposed to release on console alongside the game’s PC release over a year ago. Instead, it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-release-delayed-pc-still-on-target/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been met with multiple delays</a>.</p>



<p>When do you think we’ll see Cities: Skylines 2 released for console? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

You’ll note the broken weapon icon, typically in yellow or red, in the corner of the weapon preview window. This icon indicates your weapon is in poor condition, and if you continue using it, it will break and become unusable.</p><p>However, you can repair just about any weapon in the game by visiting a local Technician. They’re found inside safe zones, the first being Lens at Zalissya. Be wary, though. Repairing a weapon is expensive, so you likely won’t be able to fix every gun you scoop up from bandits.</p><h2 id="h347119"><a id="attachment"></a>Weapon Attachments Make Existing Weapons Better</h2><p>At the start, you’ll rock a lot of stock equipment without attachments. Why? Because you can’t afford any early on. Attachments cost a lot of coupons, especially the high-end scopes and suppressors, which you’ll find most valuable in the Zone.</p><p>Sure, you can find the occasional weapon attachment out in the world or receive one as a reward for completing a side quest, but you’ll be running low-end rifles and shotguns to start.</p><p>Once you unlock weapon attachments, keep compatibility in mind. Just because you found a suppressor doesn’t mean it’ll work on every weapon in your arsenal. Some suppressors are only designed for pistols, for instance. </p><p>To equip an attachment from your inventory, hold down T on keyboard or Up on the controller d-pad to open the weapon attachments menu. Here, you can select which piece to equip.On PC, you can also the weapon in your inventory and select an attachment from the drop-down menu.</p><h2 id="h347120"><a id="upgrade"></a>Weapon Upgrades Are A Boon</h2><figure id="" data-id="b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-recommend-id="image://b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon upgrade menu in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl shows an AKM-74S being worked on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The weapon upgrade menu in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl shows an AKM-74S being worked on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-recommend-id="image://b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon upgrade menu in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl shows an AKM-74S being worked on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that you have a fully repaired weapon with attachments equipped, it’s time to upgrade it to increase its stats. You’ll need to visit the Technician again for this.As with repairs, don’t expect anything free or cheap. You’ll spend a lot of coupons upgrading your weapons in <em>Stalker 2</em>, but it’s worthwhile.</p><p>Depending on the weapon, you can upgrade various components, including the barrel, magazine, forward grip, stock, upper receiver, lower receiver, and more. Depending on how much you’re willing to spend and the upgrade path you’d like to take, you can focus on increasing aiming speed, reducing spread, or bolstering penetration capabilities. In time, you’ll have a small arsenal of fully upgraded weapons that will take down a Burer or Controller!

While Sonic, Knuckles, and jetpack-wearing Tails all look fine running through the forests of Green Hill, it’s the line-up of both Robotniks, Shadow, and Agent Stone that’s odd. There’s a noticeable gap between Stone and Robotnik that looks strange from a shot composition standpoint. If <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is an adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, there’s one major player who appears absent from the film: Rouge the Bat.</p><p>The treasure-hunting double-agent acts as Knuckles’ rival in the Dreamcast game, and it’s a bummer that she doesn’t appear to be in the movie that adapts her debut alongside Shadow.

From what we can see in the trailer, it looks like Shadow himself is the weapon’s energy source this time around. The Chaos Emeralds were used in the second movie, but haven’t been shown in the trailers for <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> yet. So this might be one of the embellishments the movie is taking with the source material, although there is reason to believe the Chaos Emeralds will appear elsewhere in the movie.

While he’s had the black-and-red throughline in each of his outfits, he got the bald head and long mustache in <em>Sonic 2</em>, and this time around he’s got the gut and the long red coat. He still keeps his goggles on his forehead, because you don’t pay Jim Carrey millions of dollars to hide his face, but his transformation into the Doctor Eggman we know looks pretty much complete now.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="740a2cd20e489d252ac5bd4cc11df372" data-recommend-id="image://740a2cd20e489d252ac5bd4cc11df372" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Eclipse Cannon is shown being fired through the moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Eclipse Cannon is shown being fired through the moon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="740a2cd20e489d252ac5bd4cc11df372" data-recommend-id="image://740a2cd20e489d252ac5bd4cc11df372" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Eclipse Cannon is shown being fired through the moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of Eggman and Shadow’s power plays in <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>is demonstrating the Eclipse Cannon’s capabilities by blowing a hole through the moon. This plot beat has become kind of a meme at this point, as most <em>Sonic </em>games that follow don’t reflect it. Sega tried to explain this as the moon having turned, so every time we see it in subsequent games we’re just seeing the side that isn’t broken.

It seems like they’re fighting at a volcanic eruption site. There are two important shots that fans think might imply something big for the climactic fight: At one point, we get a close-up on Sonic’s eyes, which, if you look closely, reflect multi-colored light that could be the Chaos Emeralds. There’s another shot where you can briefly see what looks like a golden streak of energy dashing past the volcanic eruptions.</p><p>Fans think this might mean Sonic and Shadow may use the Chaos Emeralds to change into their Super forms. In the <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> game, Sonic and Shadow change into their Super Saiyan-like forms to team up and reverse Gerald’s plan to destroy the world, but it would be a twist if we got two superpowered hedgehogs facing each other in the final moments. Along with the conspicuous space in the Team Dark line-up, it does imply the movie may still have surprises in store when <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>premieres on December 20.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-recommend-id="image://79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman sees Gerald dressed as Santa and tackles him in a hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman sees Gerald dressed as Santa and tackles him in a hug." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-recommend-id="image://79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman sees Gerald dressed as Santa and tackles him in a hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The final scene in the trailer is a gag between both Robotniks, with Gerald shown dressed up as Santa Claus as his grandson excitedly tackles him into a Christmas tree.

Maybe Eggman is thinking of all the childhood family time he missed out on that made him the way he is. Or maybe <em>Sonic 3</em> has a Christmas subplot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
