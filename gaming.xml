            <p>The classic anime series Gundam examines the traumatic experience of war, particularly the unalterable effect it has on those young soldiers forced to participate in the horrors of fighting for their life while taking the lives of others using weapons of inhuman strength and devastation. Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-4-maps-modes-zombies-announcement">incoming crossover</a> with Mobile Suit Gundam - as the original seventies animated series was called, before it evolved with the likes of direct follow-up Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and spin-offs such as Iron Blooded Orphans the recent (and very, very excellent) Witch from Mercury - will manifest itself as a set of Operator skins, weapons, finishing moves and other such gubbins in the next season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a>.</p>
<p>Season 4 of MW3 and Warzone will add skins based on two of the iconic mecha in the older series: the RX-78-2 piloted by Amuro Ray, equipped with its Beam Rifle and shield, and the magnificent MS-06S Zaku II controlled by long-running villain Char Aznable, complete with the axe-like Heat Hawk. A third skin will then offer up The Witch from Mercury’s XVX-016 Gundam Aerial, affectionately piloted by Suletta Mercury, and its Beam Rifle, which doubles as a glowing sword in the anime.</p>

<p>The Gundam Tracer Packs will appear sometime next month, and will only run for a certain amount of time before they vanish off to wherever Gundam Evolutions go to when they die. Alongside the full skin and weapon packs, there’ll be some extra unlockables you won’t need to pay money for, offering up the chance to nab another weapon blueprint, a weapon camo, stickers, emblems, a weapon charm, calling cards and more across Warzone and MW3.</p>
<p>What is weird about all this is that the Gundams have to be shrunk down to the size of regular humans to keep things fair - meaning matches might end up looking like a cosplay LARP as people-sized robots run around and do battle. Anyway, this press release claims that “since its debut in 1979, the Gundam franchise has centred around gifted pilots commanding technologically advanced machines into the onslaught of conflict - mirroring the challenges players face in Call of Duty”. I’ll just leave you to ponder that particular comparison.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="UTOReD">Characters like the Doof Warrior don’t come along often. The unofficial mascot of Immortan Joe’s army, and a symbol of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders">bombast</a> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>, the masked rocker with the flame-spitting guitar became an instant hit on the internet and received an immediate induction into the movie icon hall of fame. </p>
<p id="Z0Altq">The Doof Warrior is <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> in miniature. Both are combinations of seemingly disparate pieces and random parts, clearly grafted onto one another, but somehow still seamlessly organized to make something perfect and unique. The Doof Warrior is just one of <em>Fury Road</em>’s many miracles, but the story of his creation is also the perfect way to understand how the film reached the legendary status it has today. After all, why wouldn’t the coolest movie of the century so far also have the coolest character in it?</p>
<h2 id="aRwz7k"><strong>The origins of the Doof Warrior </strong></h2>
<p id="jTJT25">Like the rest of <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, Coma, the Doof Warrior, seems to have come about from the perfect intersection of a wildly ambitious, visionary filmmaker and technically excellent craftspeople. </p>
<p id="Tbsmw2">The idea, as far as anyone seems to remember it, was all director George Miller’s. In Kyle Buchanan’s book about the making of the film, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Chrome-Wild-Story/dp/0063084341?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Chrome-Wild-Story/dp/0063084341?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23925988__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925988__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>, Miller explained that the character is there to “distill the nature of <em>Fury Road</em>: Kind of wacky but rooted in some sort of reality. He was the equivalent of the drummer or the bugler, with his electric guitar.” Production designer Colin Gibson put it even more succinctly in an interview with <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/9dfq3e/mad-max-fury-road-guitar-player-doof-warrior-colin-gibson">MTV News</a> shortly after the movie’s release, saying “Uncle George, being George Miller, imagined the biggest little drummer boy in the world.”</p>

<p id="FQFGUT">With that idea in mind, Gibson said that his task, as he saw it, was to “build the largest, last <a href="https://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/marshallstack.html">Marshall stack</a> at the end of the universe.” And that meant having the apocalypse’s coolest guitar to drive those amps. </p>
<p id="xtusH7">For that, Gibson turned to salvage artist Michael Ulman, who did many of the props and vehicles for <em>Fury Road</em>. Ulman put together an incredible, sculptural guitar centered around a porcelain bedpan with a French horn at the center, and Gibson put a real working guitar somewhere in the center of it because, as he put it, “George — unfortunately — doesn’t like things that don’t work.” Thus the Doof Warrior’s incredible ax was born, a feat of engineering and art that could really play music and really shoot flames as it was driven through the desert.</p>
<p id="WJvy6S">“It is the shittest guitar I’ve ever had the misfortune to have hanging in front of me,” said iOTA, the guitarist and performer who played Coma, in Buchanan’s book. But even if the guitar wasn’t ideal to play, that didn’t seem to lessen iOTA’s enthusiasm for the role. </p>
<p id="D1yAS6">The Doof Warrior was one of the many characters that Miller created a fully fleshed-out backstory for. According to iOTA in an interview with <a href="https://movieweb.com/mad-max-4-fury-road-flamethrower-guitar-backstory/">Movie Web</a>, Miller said that Immortan Joe found Coma in a cave and had him schooled in music in order to lead his army into battle. Displaying a kind of dark creativity commensurate with the role, iOTA did Miller one better by suggesting that Coma was found in the cave clutching his mother’s decapitated head, and that Coma took her face off and wears it as his battle mask in her honor. </p>
<h2 id="sXiuYu"><strong>When the Doof Warrior took over the internet </strong></h2>
<div id="i0AwfW"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1bZYdfvmBk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WYkjnz">The Doof Warrior took the internet by storm the instant he arrived on the scene. As Cory Watson, the director of <em>Fury Road</em>’s behind-the-scenes documentary, told Buchanan, “You can’t even count the number of articles on the Doof Warrior that came out in the year or two after the film was released.” Sure, he quickly popped up in memes and gifs on Twitter and as a prime target for <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/15-fantastic-pieces-of-mad-c1432857850817.html">fanart</a>, but the way websites wrote about him was an almost perfect mirror of the film’s success. </p>
<p id="kVlKcV">While its cultural legacy may be massive now, <em>Fury Road</em> started off small at the box office, with just a $45 million opening weekend. As more people saw the movie and told everyone they could about how incredible it was, the movie became the fabled “word of mouth success,” eventually earning more than $150 million at the domestic box office and nearly $400 million worldwide. </p>
<p id="6p92Mk">Similarly, enthusiasm for the Doof Warrior started small, with critics and writers who saw the movie early <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2015/may/18/mad-max-fury-road-crazy-guitar-guy-doof-warrior-turning-it-up-to-11">writing about how cool the “guitar guy</a>” was, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/the-doof-warrior-max-max-fury-road">explainers popping up about who exactly the character was</a>. But as more and more people saw <em>Fury Road</em> and started clamoring to learn more about it, internet entertainment outlets started focusing their coverage even more and writing more and more stories.</p>
<p id="7cxfWg">Eventually, most of the stories started calling him by his rightful title, the Doof Warrior, instead of referring to him as <em>Fury Road</em>’s “guitar guy,” and the crew were happy to give reporters a peek behind the curtain. There were interviews with <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/9dfq3e/mad-max-fury-road-guitar-player-doof-warrior-colin-gibson">Gibson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrqhzZnERWA">Ulman</a>, and even <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/rkqb3m/we-talked-to-the-dude-who-plays-a-flame-throwing-guitar-in-mad-max-fury-road">iOTA himself</a>. Just like the movie, what started as an unbelievable curiosity suddenly bloomed into a cultural fascination that persists to this day: A cult hit that broke into the mainstream to become an absolute classic. </p>

<h2 id="KALGIr"><strong>The Doof Warrior still embodies Fury Road’s spirit</strong></h2>
<p id="8DzcEc">To give you an idea of how close <em>Fury Road</em> came to being a totally different movie, Miller told Buchanan in <em>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Chrome</em> that the studio tried to cut the Doof Warrior several times. <em>Fury Road</em> had several different test screenings, and at most of them the Doof Warrior only had temporary sound, so he was playing the same guitar riff every time, annoying audiences. Miller had plenty of experience keeping <em>Fury Road </em>alive despite studio attempts to shut the production down, and the Doof Warrior was no different — the biggest little drummer boy stayed in. </p>
<p id="QhgO1t">Miller knew exactly what he was doing with Coma: “What I knew and no one else knew is that his music was going to evolve, and eventually that would become part of the full orchestration of the story. Of course, by the time the film was finished, he became probably one of the most popular characters.” </p>
<p id="ffQuCf">And that’s still true to this day. The Doof Warrior is an instantly recognizable symbol of <em>Fury Road</em>. A character too cool to be in any other movie, but also one of Miller and the crew’s dozens of world-building masterstrokes that help propel <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> from a great movie to a true one-of-a-kind classic.</p>

However, some of those same people have started leaking footage of the yet-unannounced game online and the reaction has been...mixed, to say the least. </p><div data-video-id="193974" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="194" data-playlist="193974,196131,195189" data-current="193974"><div><p>The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19440.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>We’ve known about <em>Deadlock </em>for years now, based on leaks and datamined information from other Valve games. The project was likely codenamed <em>Citadel </em>and was at one point <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NEONPRIME/comments/10f9hkx/neon_prime_collated_leaksinfo/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NEONPRIME/comments/10f9hkx/neon_prime_collated_leaksinfo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known internally as <em>Neon Prime</em>.</a></span> It likely started development some time in 2018, and has gone through a lot of changes according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/T7KuuJO_lqw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/T7KuuJO_lqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous leaks</a></span>, though it was always an online team-based shooter with <em>DOTA</em>-like elements. At one point, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/k8MqhEz6N_k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/k8MqhEz6N_k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reportedly going to be set in the <em>Half-Lif</em>e universe</a></span>, but that seems to have changed, as shown in the recently leaked gameplay. </p><p>So what is <em>Deadlock </em>today? Well, based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gameplay and screenshots</a></span> from the closed alpha test, <em>Deadlock </em>will be a hero-based online third-person shooter featuring maps with MOBA-like lanes, mobs to kill, and <em>Bioshock Infinite</em>-like rails that you can grind around to get to areas quickly. </p><p>In the alpha test footage that has leaked online, it seems the game currently has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pDylan002/status/1793301907223535857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pDylan002/status/1793301907223535857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 characters</a></span>, and all of them share a similar steampunk-meets-fantasy style, similar to the rest of the game’s vibes. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Valve about <em>Deadlock</em>. </p><p>It should be noted that this build of <em>Deadlock </em>is likely still early and the game will change in looks and gameplay as it gets closer to an official launch, the reaction to leaked gameplay and screenshots of Valve’s next big thing has been fairly muted, with most fans more confused than anything else. </p><h2 id="h15875"><a id=""></a>The reaction to Valve’s next game hasn’t been great</h2><p>While I’ve spotted some folks excited to see what Valve is working on next, the majority of online chatter around <em>Deadlock </em>is focused on how “late” this game feels. The hero shooter craze has mostly died out, and the demand for another one, with MOBA-elements no less, seems lacking. The game’s generic, IP-less style and world have also confused fans who have long wanted a new <em>Half-Life</em> or <em>Portal </em>game from Valve, but are instead getting something more akin to <em>Valorant </em>meets <em>Overwatch</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to details from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>, people who have reportedly played <em>Deadlock </em>say that it plays very much like a MOBA, with creeps running around maps. Killing these weaker NPCs (possibly known as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1cxttrj/deadlocks_creeps_are_candle_men/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1cxttrj/deadlocks_creeps_are_candle_men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">candles or candlemen</a></span>) will reward players with a currency that can be used to upgrade their hero during that match. It’s also reported that a giant boss spawns in the middle of the map and can be killed for more upgrade currency. </p><figure id="" data-id="e46928f12d270ed7e528d6c0f97025f6" data-recommend-id="image://e46928f12d270ed7e528d6c0f97025f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Gordon shooting a heli with an SMG in Half-Life 2.

Valve is good at making games. And sure, that’s generally true, but keep in mind that when it comes to original, internally designed multiplayer games, well, Valve’s track record is far from great.<br></p><p>Yes, <em>DOTA 2, CSGO, </em>and <em>TF2 </em>are wonderful, but those are all games Valve inherited from outside developers and modders and then built upon and expanded. When it comes to <em>wholly </em>original online games, Valve has released stuff like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valves-card-game-is-officially-dead-1846410290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valves-card-game-is-officially-dead-1846410290"><em>Artifact</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>(a now-dead card game), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/60/Ricochet/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/60/Ricochet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ricochet</em></a></span> (a bad <em>HL1</em>-era esport thing), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046930/Dota_Underlords/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046930/Dota_Underlords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DOTA Underlords</em></a></span><em> </em>(an <em>Auto Chess </em>clone that fizzled out after a few months), and <em>Half-Life Deathmatch</em> which... okay, that was alright. </p><p>But yeah, I’m not confident in Valve’s next game setting the world on fire, and the online reaction to it seems to back up those concerns. We’ll have to wait and see how Valve reacts to this feedback and how it affects (or doesn’t affect) <em>Deadlock.</em></p><p><em>.</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kr3br-3i8TY" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.</p>

<p>Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: <em>Baptism of Fire</em>, <em>The Tower of the Swallow,</em> and <em>Lady of the Lake</em>. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and&nbsp;Freya Allan&nbsp;(Ciri).&nbsp;</p>

 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Ranked Mode will also be officially released later down the line.

 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft will also improve <em>XDefiant</em> altogether by maintaining a balanced experience for all players.

You should be packing some excellent gear and be at or above level 100 to take on Echo of Andariel.

 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Working backwards, in order to summon the Echo of Andariel, you’re going to need <strong>two Pincushioned Dolls and two Sandscorched Shackles</strong>. Pincushioned Dolls are gained from The Beast in the Ice and Sandscorched Shackles are dropped by Lord Zir. These are endgame bosses if that isn’t already clear. You need to fight them in World Tier 4.</p> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">You’ve probably learned this, but the Pincushioned Dolls and Sanscorched Shackles you use in the summon will be consumed.</p>
 <p data-characters="125" data-current-count="125" data-injectable="false">Andariel is pretty analogous to her brother Duriel. That’s in terms of power level, but also in the loot that gets dropped.</p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="false">Also note that you can now fight Tormented versions of the bosses, if you feel prepared. These are level 200 versions that have better chances at rare loot. In order to summon the tormented version, you need <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-sygian-stone-in-diablo-4-season-4/">Stygian Stones</a>, as well as six Sandsorched Shackles and six Pincushioned Dolls. Good hunting.</p>

<p data-characters="429" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Hellblade 2 </em>is a visual feast no matter where you look. Whether it be the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-open-the-village-gate-in-hellblade-2/">environmental details</a> offering gorgeous vistas, the more supernatural elements being surprisingly grotesque, or the smooth transitions between cutscenes and gameplay, your eyes never want to look away. Though for all its beauty, the mandatory black bars on the game aren’t the best. Here’s whether you can remove the black bars in <em>Hellblade 2</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-is-it-possible-to-get-rid-of-the-black-bars-in-hellblade-2" data-injectable="false">Is it possible to get rid of the black bars in Hellblade 2?</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">If you’re playing <em>Hellblade 2</em> on Xbox,<strong> removing the black bars is impossible</strong>. No settings let you remove them, and you can’t tweak anything about your install either. This is the case for the PC version as well, but it isn’t technically impossible to remove the black bars there. You’ll just need to seek outside help through a mod, rather than the game itself.</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2/mods/6">No Black Bars (Letterboxing fix) No Zoom mod</a> by Giodga removes the black bars without affecting image quality and lets you get a better look at the world. If you’re willing to take the plunge, then you’ll want to take the following steps to install the mod:</p>

 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">With that done, launch the game again and the black bars should be gone. If they aren’t or there’s a major issue, you may want to <strong>check the mod page again</strong> for troubleshooting assistance.</p>

<p data-characters="148" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Search and Destroy is a staple in <em>Call of Duty</em> and its competitive scene, and players may want to know if there is a similar game mode in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">Since the start of <em>Call of Duty</em>, Search and Destroy has been in every title. The goal of the game mode is for the attacking side to either eliminate the defending team, or arm and detonate one of the two bomb sites. Meanwhile, the defending team can either defuse the bomb (once planted) or take out all of the attackers. Players only have one life per round, and the first team who wins six rounds emerges victorious. Along the way, there have been a few different variations of the game mode, but the core principles have always been the same. </p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">Other FPS titles have similar game modes, leading to the question of whether or not it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-is-search-and-destroy-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Is Search and Destroy in <em>XDefiant</em>? </h2> <figure data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false"><strong>There is no Search</strong> <strong>and Destroy mode in <em>XDefiant</em> or any similar game mode</strong>. However, a player <a href="https://x.com/ItsMagicT/status/1792939283659288641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> on Twitter if a search-and-destroy mode would ever be added, and XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1792939592162939219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed </a>that the game mode <strong>would be added</strong> in a future update. </p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">After a six-week pre-season period, <em>XDefiant</em> will release a new seasonal update every three months to add new weapons, maps, events, and factions. Throughout the title’s first year, there will be four new factions, 12 weapons, 12 maps, and more modes and features. </p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft also confirmed that an official Ranked Mode will be added in a future update. With that in mind, a Search and Destroy game mode could potentially be the perfect game mode to complement the other potential offerings in a competitive setting.</p>

            <p>
A new year means a new Call of Duty, meaning Activision Blizzard is going to have to get around to unveiling it at some point. Reports are suggesting that 'some point' will almost certainly be during Microsoft's Xbox showcase this June, but before then, the first teaser has seemingly now been spotted in an unassuming corner of the internet.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, a likely new Call of Duty 2024 teaser site has emerged (thanks <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1793301871429382299">Charlie Intel</a>) at <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/">TheTruthLies.com</a>, where visitors are able to fiddle with some buttons on a TV set and watch a quick blast of mysterious footage.
</p>
<p>
Currently, only one of the TV's six channels shows footage when selected, and there's no explicit Call of Duty branding to definitively confirm the connection - but it's an easy enough leap to make given the distinctive orange logo that appears in various places around the site.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>TheTruthLies.com's first bit of mysterious footage.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mXJ3S3bLL4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Starting with the footage, though, it's a short jigglycam sequence - more The Blair Witch Project than Call of Duty, to be honest - that features a group of (gasp) activists scurrying through the woods at night. "This'll wake them up", somone says at one point, and we eventually see the results of their scheming when the footage cuts to daylight - revealing Mount Rushmore's four presidential faces now festooned with blindfolds and adorned with the words, "The truth lies".
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the site's metadata has a longer version of that slogan, reading, "You might remember a better time. But it was false. Trust no one. Open your eyes. Find the truth."
</p>
<p>
It's the big orange logo squirted across Abraham Lincoln's noggin (and used as the site's favicon) that ties things together, of course; it's the same logo - a three headed dog - Microsoft previously used to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">tease the mystery Direct event</a> that'll immediately follow its Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday, 9th June. Last year, it was reported Call of Duty 2024 was being developed by Treyarch under the codename Cerebrus, so there's your link.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, we might know a fair bit about Call of Duty 2024 already. A report last November claimed it would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">Black Ops title set in the Gulf War</a> and featuring 'traditional combat technology' - one supposedly attempting "explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict."
</p>
<p>
More details will likely arrive on 9th June, and we can seemingly expect at least five more TheTruthLies.com teases ahead of then. There's no hint of a release date for Call of Duty 2024 yet - beyond claims of a "late fall, early winter" launch - but whenever it shows up, it'll reportedly be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">day-one title on Game Pass</a>.

            <p>We already know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cat-and-mouse-creation-of-hunt-showdown-and-why-there-may-never-be-a-hunt-2">a full-blown sequel</a> to swampy extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-will-never-replace-hunt-showdown-with-hunt-2-the-way-overwatch-2-did-overwatch-1">probably isn’t on the cards right now</a>, but developers Crytek appear to be lining up the next major update for the 2019 PvPvE cryptid-slayer as almost a whole new game regardless.</p>

<p>The upcoming update due to drop this summer - August 15th specifically, as confirmed in a new developer diary - will bring the half-decade-old FPS over onto the shiny CryEngine 5.11 engine, with all the visual polish, performance improvements and overall whizz-bangery that allows for.  Helping to showcase the new engine will be the first new map and biome in over three years, but we don’t know what that’ll look like or where it’ll be set just yet.</p>
<p>While the underlying gameplay will remain the same, general manager David Fifield said that the update is big enough to be considered “a significant relaunch of Hunt: Showdown at a whole new level”, adding that it will kickstart a “whole new era of Hunt”.</p>
<p>Part of that era, for what it’s worth, will be a fairly literal generation change, as away from PC the engine update means that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players will no longer receive official support (but will be able to carry over all their stuff to the new version for free when they do upgrade) - which might have at least some knock-on effect for those playing cross-platform on PC.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0lAW63LTYo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Looking ahead, Fifield highlighted the new user interface and the systems for recruiting hunters and earning prestige as among those that will “continue to evolve”, with the developers also taking a closer look at hunter revival, health chunks, restorations and the ability to burn downed hunters, as well as aiming to reduce match stalemates in favour of “more definitive fights”.</p>
<p>There’ll also be some separate tweaks behind the scenes to things like matchmaking and servers, joining a step up in efforts to tackle cheaters and other “exploitive play”, aiming to improve the overall multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>Crytek plans to tease out more details in a series of weekly updates between now and August, before the major update lands on the 15th.</p>

  <p id="l2rXdh">“<strong>Outbreak Refined</strong>” is a bonus quest in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>’s reprised “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24155578/zero-hour-walkthrough-outbreak-perfected-exotic-pattern">Zero Hour</a>” mission, which will allow you to unlock new perks for you to further customize your<strong> Outbreak Perfected</strong> Exotic Pulse rifle. To get these new perks, you’ll need to flip some hidden <strong>switches</strong> in the legend version of the mission each week. You can pick up “Outbreak Refined” from Ada-1 after you’ve completed “Zero Hour” for her once before.</p>
<p id="8fGt4X">In this <em>Destiny 2</em> guide, we’ll walk you through how to complete the legend version of “Zero Hour” and finish the “Outbreak Refined” quest. If you need to upgrade the Intrinsic perk for Outbreak Perfected and pick up the new Vimana Junker Exotic ship, check out our guide on the “Zero Hour” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23925011">vault puzzle</a>.</p>
<p id="4UJqjH"><strong>Note</strong>: Only two of the three Outbreak Refined quests are available at the time of this writing. The final quest will become available on May 28, and we’ll update this guide to reflect the new switch locations.</p>

<hr id="8gjIbp">
<h2 id="jXpWbl"><strong>How to complete ‘Zero Hour’ on legend</strong></h2>
<p id="nBmNAL">Before I tell you where to find the switches, first you need to know how to complete “Zero Hour” on legend. Unlike “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24124313/whisper-walkthrough-worm-exotic-pattern">The Whisper</a>” mission, the route you’ll take in “Zero Hour” changes based on the difficulty, so you’ll need to learn a partially different path if you want to complete this quest.</p>
<p id="8sZJGj">Start up “Zero Hour” on legend mode and get ready to run. While the normal version of this mission gives you 40 minutes, on legend you only get 20, and have to fight against more difficult combatants.</p>

<p id="Msgw2T">The first part of the mission plays out the same on both legend and normal, so proceed through the quest until you’ve killed all the Fallen, dropped down the elevator, and reached the room where you normally jump down to the ship on the bottom left. But this time, do not jump down. Instead, turn right.</p>
<p id="7j0OOl">You’ll see a group of air vents shaped like an E on the room. Run over to it and make your way to the top right vent. On the back side of the vent, you’ll see an open pathway. Take it. </p>

<p id="kfw9i9">You’ll now find yourself on a big, concrete lid, in a room with four other lids, numbered one through four. Ignore them for now and drop down to your left, into the watery drain. There’s a hole toward the bottom that will lead you to a platform. Stand on it and turn around to face where you jumped from. Go into the little pathway here.</p>

<p id="i6uzS3">Now you’ll be in a bit of a pipe maze, and there are switches on the wall for you to throw. These switches correspond to the concrete lids. The lid you need to open is three, and you’ll find the switch for it in the back left of this maze. Run forward, jump up to the scaffolding on your left, and then jump down to the left again, so you land diagonally from where you entered this area. Go down the path and flip the switch. </p>
<p id="6pI6Zt">Return to the concrete lids and climb on top of number three — don’t go in it. Use the lid as a jumping point to climb up the drain. At the top, take a left and head into the open vent on top of the boxes. Follow the path until you get to a big pit. Carefully jump into the cubbies here and kill the Fallen in your way. Jump from doorway to doorway until you can exit on the left side of the room, near the Captain. (If you throw the switch here, you’ll make this room much easier for your friends.)</p>

<p id="ggqoiA">Follow the path until you reach outside the Tower. Take a left and look for the very small footholds along the wall. Climb the pipes and be careful of the small metal platforms, as they’ll collapse after a few seconds of standing on them. Round the corner of the Tower and keep going. Climb up to the open vent and be careful of the exploding shanks inside. </p>
<p id="PYGl5y">Take a right and slide down the chute. Make sure to jump at the end so you don’t fall into the pit. From here, jump into the pipe room on your right and then climb the pipes up to a landing. From there, look left and shoot out the vent. You’ll now be in the fan room, which is where the points converge.</p>
<p id="CqirNw">Follow the normal route here until you reach the Cryptarch’s vault. Now you’ll need to know the secret vault path to stop yourself from being incinerated. Like on normal difficulty, this path changes every day, and is based on the burn for the mission (which you can check by opening your Ghost). </p>

<p id="DB9efC">Once you know your way through legend “Zero Hour,” finding these hidden switches is fairly simple. </p>
<p id="47j8kJ">After you’ve killed enough Fallen with Outbreak Perfected to advance the “<strong>Outbreak Refined 1</strong>” quest, head into legend “Zero Hour” and make your way to the <strong>concrete lids</strong> — the ones labeled one through four. Flip the three switch like normal. But this time, on your way back, stop by the scaffolding in the center of the pipe maze. On the sides of the room, you’ll see what looks like two big air conditioners. Above one of them, you’ll see a switch. Flip it and you’ll get a countdown on your screen that says “<strong>Catalyst Switch Primed</strong>” and then a short countdown.</p>

<p id="iTIETs">Run as fast as you can up to the number three lid and climb all the way to the top. Go through the doorway and turn left. Next to the shelf, you’ll see a switch on the wall. Flip it before your timer hits zero and you’ll finish this part of the quest. If the timer is a little too quick for you, have no fear, as you can do this route backward as well, and it’s actually a bit easier. Simply throw the switch next to the shelf, jump down the hole, and make your way back to the air conditioner switch.</p>
<p id="DmLsy9">Once you’ve successfully thrown the switches, you need to complete “Zero Hour” on legend. If you’ve already wasted too much time on the switches, you can restart the mission and you’ll stay on the same step — no need to do the switch puzzle again.</p>
<p id="vsKoo6">When you finish the mission on legend, you’ll be able to take the quest back to Ada-1, who will give you the <strong>Rapid Hit</strong> perk that you can now use to customize your Outbreak Perfected.</p>

<p id="Q5iD1z">Throw the switch and you’ll complete this step of the quest. Once again, you’ll need to complete the mission on Legend to get your bonus perk. But once you do — and return to Ada-1 — you’ll get the <strong>Rewind Rounds</strong> perk, which is very powerful in PvE.</p>

Here’s what I’ve found so far when it comes to shaping Senua into the perfect warrior against the forces of darkness.</p><h2 id="h14410"><a id=""></a>You can put the combat on auto-pilot</h2><p>If you’re just here for the narrative and puzzle solving, you can either radically simplify the combat or put it entirely on auto-pilot, letting Senua do all the attacking and dodging on her own. Navigate to Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Accessibility and under Actions you’ll see Default, Simplified, and Self-play for both Offensive and Defensive actions, meaning you can either automate Senua’s attacks or her defenses, or both. <br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857">How To Make The Most Of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s Graphics On PC</a></span></p><p>This is a great way to simplify the game so you can focus on the story, OR to see the combat in action without your input.</p><h2 id="h14411"><a id=""></a>Blocking and parrying basics</h2><p>In <em>Hellblade II</em>, you want to be very active in blocking (as well as evading). Combat in this game is very much about paying attention to each individual opportunity to strike or prevent a strike—especially on the higher difficulties.</p><p>Holding RB/Ctrl will see Senua block attacks. This allows you to withstand most normal blows fairly well, but enemies have a few tricks up their sleeves and can find ways to break Senua’s stance. One example is when an enemy’s weapon glows red before they strike: While you can still block such an attack, it will knock you off balance, leaving you open. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-recommend-id="image://e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-recommend-id="image://e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, if you block mere moments (and by moments, I mean milliseconds; the window to time this is incredibly small) before a strike hits, Senua will instead parry her enemy’s attack, which can leave them open for a fatal finisher from her. This includes the more powerful attacks where an enemy’s weapon glows red.</p><h2 id="h14412"><a id=""></a>Evading is as essential as blocking</h2><p>If you press A/Spacebar, Senua will take a step back. If you move and press A/spacebar, Senua will duck and move in the direction of your analog stick (or WASD input). This is the best way to deal with an enemy’s heavy attack (when their weapon glows red). You can also put some distance between you and a foe by holding back and hitting the evade button/key.</p><h2 id="h14413"><a id=""></a>You can cancel attacks by evading and blocking</h2><p>Canceling attacks is pretty important to the general flow of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s combat. Senua is perhaps most vulnerable while she’s in an attack animation that hasn’t yet landed its blow. Good news: blocking and evading cancels out an attack animation.</p><figure id="" data-id="8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-recommend-id="image://8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Note how Senua blocks in the middle of a heavy strike, which results in a perfect parry.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-recommend-id="image://8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is perhaps most important for heavy attacks. When an enemy is in a block stance (or using a shield), fast attacks won’t do a whole lot. You’ll need to land a heavy attack, the wind-up of which is rather slow. If you’re trying to land a heavy attack but see that an enemy is about to hit you before Senua finishes her attack animation, simply evade with a directional input and a press of A or spacebar and you’ll cancel out the heavy attack. You can also block with RB/Ctrl and cancel out attacks. (It’s hard to know for sure, but I seem to pull off successful parries more often by canceling out an attack with a block, so perhaps the parry window changes during a cancel).</p><p>You can also cancel out fast attacks (X/Left mouse button), but these are usually so swift that you won’t need to worry about it. Still, it’s worth keeping in mind.</p><h2 id="h14414"><a id=""></a>Mash evade to get up or use Focus</h2><p>If an enemy gets the better of you and knocks you to the ground, you have two ways to get back up. You can either mash the evade button (A/spacebar) or activate your Focus ability to get up quicker.</p><h2 id="h14415"><a id=""></a>Evasion is the key to fire-breathers</h2><figure id="" data-id="f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-recommend-id="image://f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-recommend-id="image://f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fire-breathing enemies are a bit of a pain in <em>Saga</em> as you can’t block flames. Instead, you’ll have to evade their bursts of fire with a directional input + the evade button/key. Fire-breathers attack to their left and right as well as to the front. The latter is the most disorienting as the camera doesn’t make it obvious how to steer clear. In general, moving back with directional input combined with Evade is the best way to avoid the flames.</p><h2 id="h14416"><a id=""></a>You can sprint in combat too</h2><p>If you’re trying to close the distance between Senua and the enemy quickly, sprinting will help. Holding LB or Shift while moving in combat will see Senua sprint forward. If you hit the attack button while sprinting during Senua’s Focus ability (RT/E), Senua will perform a leaping attack.</p><figure id="" data-id="7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-recommend-id="image://7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Focus + Sprint + Attack results in a leaping strike.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-recommend-id="image://7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h14417"><a id=""></a>Don’t waste Senua’s Focus ability</h2><p>Senua has a focus ability which slows down time and allows her to execute a number of rapid slashes. You’ll charge this ability by attacking, taking damage, and executing perfect parries.</p><p>But Focus isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card for Senua. It is possible, particularly during the more challenging brawls, to miss your attacks while using this ability and you can also still be struck depending on an enemy’s stance. Also, if you activate it at a distance, make sure you’re sprinting forward to land a leaping attack on your enemy.</p><h2 id="h14418"><a id=""></a><em>Senua’s Saga</em> combat difficulty options explained</h2><p>In Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Combat Difficulty, you’ll find four options which you can change at any time (including during fights). Just how Dynamic adjusts the difficulty is hard to discern for certain, but easy, normal, and hard seem to influence how many hits Senua can take before she’s knocked to the ground, where an enemy can easily execute a coup d’état. Based on my research (which I did by allowing the first enemy in the Draugar Fight to attack me), Senua would get sent to her downed state after the following number of attacks: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Easy</strong>: five strikes<br><strong>Normal</strong>: four strikes<br><strong>Hard</strong>: three strikes</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to tell exactly how difficulty affects the strength of Senua’s attacks. Without standard HUD elements like health bars and floaty numbers all over the place, we don’t have anything concrete to go on. That said, after running through the “Draugar Battle” a few times on different difficulties, I do feel like Senua’s able to chew through enemies a little faster on the easier difficulties <br></p><h2 id="h14419"><a id=""></a>Where to practice combat</h2><figure id="" data-id="ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-recommend-id="image://ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-recommend-id="image://ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As soon as you start making progress in <em>Hellblade II</em>, you’ll gain access to chapter selection.

For example, while the Loot Reborn overhaul made Aspects permanent unlocks, applying them to new gear can still cost a lot in addition to the usual fees associated with repairs and rerolling items at the Occultist. But the biggest culprit has been post-campaign masterworking, a new system for slowly leveling up the stat affixes on a piece of gear.</p><p>Only available at World Tier 4, each new rank costs additional crafting resources and a ton of gold.

And because of the RNG involved, hardcore players will often find themselves resetting and starting over, which alone costs 5 million gold. It was creating a huge bottleneck as players farmed the new Pit of the Artificer boss rush mode for crafting materials, only to find themselves short on gold.</p><p>“While we continue to review the gold economy there is one change we felt we needed to make right away,” associate game director Joseph Piepiora <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JPiepiora/status/1792315402716094907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JPiepiora/status/1792315402716094907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> over the weekend. A hotfix “dramatically reduced” Masterworking material conversion costs to ease the stress on post-game players’ pocketbooks. It was a huge nerf. The biggest cost of 6 million gold went down to just 60,000. Players were relieved, but it still wasn’t enough.</p><p>“Gold costs are too damn high!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cxm3uz/today_in_response_to_concerns_about_too_many_gold/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cxm3uz/today_in_response_to_concerns_about_too_many_gold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the <em>Diablo IV</em> subreddit today. “I got equipment, beautiful pieces of equipment with greater affixes. They’re sitting in my stash. I need to reroll stats off them. I need to redo the aspect power. I need to masterwork them. Just not enough gold for all of that.” Not everyone is on board with the gold nerfs, however. More casual players have been enjoying the currency’s renewed significance. “Your items are on a journey, you aren’t supposed to get there overnight.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cteet9/anyone_else_like_that_gold_has_value_now/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cteet9/anyone_else_like_that_gold_has_value_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one.</p><p>One major source of the frustration around gold is the fact that farming it is so uneven. The most efficient way to build up your bank account is grinding Whisper Caches, which players don’t like because it doesn’t involve rapidly crushing hordes of demons. Helltides, which do involve rapidly crushing hordes of demons, can net you a lot of gold if you sell off all of the gear dropped during them, but they’re still a noticeably slower gold farm overall. As one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cv073o/issue_is_not_with_gold_grind_it_is_the_gameplay/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cv073o/issue_is_not_with_gold_grind_it_is_the_gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently put it</a></span>, “[the] issue is not with gold grind, it is the gameplay loop for gold grind.”</p><p>The masterworking gold rush recently led to a spike in real money prices for buying the in-game currency through online trades. Currently, you can get about 1 billion gold for around $25. That’s a nearly seven-fold increase from what gold was selling for just before season 4 went live. Some players have used this as evidence that <em>Diablo IV</em>’s current gold economy is still out of whack, while others argue that the action-RPG’s progression design shouldn’t be influenced by the illicit activities of high-end players.</p><p>Despite the recent massive gold cost nerfs, it sounds like Blizzard is still looking for other ways to give players a break. “Team made a change this weekend but we may turn some additional levers on this and a few other mat items players have noted to us,” global community manager Adam Fletcher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/too-much-gold-sinks-and-not-enough-gold/160911/118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/too-much-gold-sinks-and-not-enough-gold/160911/118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on the Blizzard forum yesterday.

<p data-characters="359" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a long PvE content lull, <em>Halo Infinite </em>is getting an injection of some much-needed Firefight-esque action. Courtesy of the Forge Falcons, a community-led group of Forge gurus who focus on creating unique experiences using the robust toolset found in game, players are being treated to two weeks of, essentially, <em>Halo: Zombies</em>, called <em>Survive the Undead</em>.</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">A <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/combat-workshop-survive-the-undead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post over on Halo Waypoint</a> details the new experience as a battle of attrition with a simple objective: survive. If that sounds familiar, you’re probably the target audience for this sort of thing. Players will earn points by slaying “zombies,” which can then be spent in typical <em>Call of Duty: Zombies</em> fashion on upgrades, perks, or a “mystery box.” It could contain anything, even upgrades or perks! </p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">It should be noted that while this mode will appear in matchmaking through the Combat Workshop for two weeks (from now until June 4), it isn’t an official game type, but rather a 343-sanctioned community Forge mode. What I mean by this is, expect some quirks, like the blog post’s warning that “while waiting to respawn, make sure you wiggle your sticks to keep from getting kicked from inactivity.”</p>
 <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="false">Still, the Forge Falcons have been cooking up unique <em>Halo: Infinite </em>experiences for quite a while, including their own twist on a Battle Royale, so it’s nice to see 343 giving them some well-deserved time in the spotlight. As for what this will do for <em>Halo: Infinite’s</em> steady but somewhat languishing player count remains to be seen, but hopefully it’ll spark more interest in additional PvE experiences. Since King of the Hill Firefight launched last December, we haven’t seen so much as a whiff of another game type of its kind from the developers themselves.</p>

<p data-characters="157" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Treyarch has players putting on their detective hats to piece together the puzzle after releasing a creepy teaser video for the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> title. </p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Treyarch created a new website domain called <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/6/">the truth lies</a>. When you go on to the website, a video on a CRT shows a group of people climbing Mount Rushmore and putting blindfolds over the former presidents’ faces with “the truth lies” written on the first three. The fourth blindfold has what will presumably be the logo for the next title. Since the TV on the website only goes up to Channel 6, this strongly hints at the title being <em>Call of Duty</em> <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">As <em>Call of Duty </em>fans play around more with the TV on the website and pick through the video with a fine-tooth comb, more teasers will undoubtedly be discovered. There will reportedly be a full reveal for the next<em> Call of Duty </em>at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 9 at 10 AM PT. Knowing Treyarch, more teasers are likely on the way.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">This particular video coincidentally arrives one day after Ubisoft launched its 6v6 arena shooter, <em>XDefiant</em>. Ubisoft executive producer and former <em>Call of Duty</em> dev Mark Rubin has previously <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1670894140761214980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shot down</a> any comparisons or competition between the two titles. Still, it’s hard to overlook the timing of the video, as <em>Call of Duty</em> briefly steals the spotlight back for a moment. </p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="false">As for when players can get their hands on the upcoming title,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-reportedly-be-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors</a>&nbsp;suggest that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>&nbsp;will launch in late October. The new&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;is expected to be available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox, and there’s a lot of speculation around whether it may <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-reportedly-be-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also come to Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <p>After a few set photo leaks earlier in the month, we now have an official first look at Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in season four of Netflix's The Witcher series.</p>
<p>A new image along with a short piece of footage shows the former Hunger Games actor with Geralt's white locks and a suitably moody stare.</p>
<p>First up, that footage, which you can see below. The Netflix team has gone for the 'strong but silent' vibe with this clip, showing Hemsworth making his way through the misty landscape with Geralt's horse Roach, before he turns to look towards the camera.</p>

<p>"His look has been in development for over a year, so it's thrilling to finally share an official sneak peek of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia," The Witcher showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich told <a href="https://ew.com/the-witcher-liam-hemsworth-first-look-official-season-4-exclusive-8651511">EW</a>.</p>
<p>"Cast and crew alike have been struck by the passion, energy, and embodiment Liam has brought to the character from day one -- scruffy beard, iconic scar, and all! We're having so much fun filming season four and are excited to welcome fans along on this journey with us."</p>
<p>Just for good measure, here is the new still from The Witcher's fourth season:</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Netflix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hemsworth was first announced to be joining the cast for the fourth season of The Witcher in 2022, when former Geralt actor Henry Cavill announced he was "laying down [his] medallion and [his] swords".</p>
<p>"As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Cavill wrote at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Hemsworth will portray the series' monster hunter for the show's fourth and presumably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">fifth and final season</a>. And, he won't be the only new face on set when the next season airs. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-casts-laurence-fishburne-for-fourth-season-of-netflix-show">Matrix star Laurence Fishburne is also joining the cast</a> as Regis. Danny Woodburn, meanwhile, has been announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-the-witcher-series-adds-seinfeld-conan-star">Geralt's dwarf friend Zoltan Chivay</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162520/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="B0SFn8">The biggest question hanging over the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23809084/witcher-season-4-release-date-cast-news-liam-hemsworth">upcoming fourth season</a> of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-witcher"><em>The Witcher</em></a> has, for better or for worse, been about casting. Liam Hemsworth has replaced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23428458/henry-cavill-superman-man-of-steel">former Superman</a> Henry Cavill as the monster hunter Geralt of Rivia for the show’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134071/witcher-season-4-netflix-season-5-final">final two seasons</a>, and naturally people want to know how well he slides into that snug leather armor. Netflix’s first season 4 tease is geared towards answering that question, and nothing more. </p>
<p id="D1F8pB">The one-minute clip slowly approaches nu-Geralt from behind in a foggy wood, closing in as Hemsworth looks over his shoulder to reveal that hey, he looks like Geralt! This is not that shocking, I suppose, as the people making this show have eyes and probably do want some kind of visual continuity here. Of course, in this very controlled and narrow glimpse, none of his co-stars or familiar haunts are present to register any dissonance, so seeing him — and more importantly, <em>hearing </em>him — in actual action is where the challenge lies. </p>
<p id="GpAWDV">As for when we’ll see any more, that remains to be seen. There’s still no official premiere date for season 4, but considering how the series left Geralt <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23809906/the-witcher-season-3-part-2-review">in a pretty pickle last season</a>, it’s hard to object to <em>The Witcher</em>’s creative team taking its time to get our favorite mutated monster slayer’s re-introduction right. </p>

<p id="fNKPmS">When it first enters the battlefield, it immediately deals three damage to another creature or player, and gains its controller three life — an effect that already exists on a popular card called Lightning Helix, which for years existed as a cornerstone in Modern’s red/white burn deck. But like its Titan predecessors, Phlage then sacrifices itself and heads to the graveyard until its additional escape cost is paid. </p>

<p id="38md01">In order to move Phlage from the graveyard back to the battlefield, its controller must pay an additional four mana and exile five other cards from the graveyard – only then does it stay on the battlefield, triggering its Lightning Helix effect again upon entry, and repeatedly after that whenever it attacks.</p>
<h2 id="YvMgEG"><strong>The legacy and decline of Modern burn decks</strong></h2>
<p id="WV8QPe">Historically, red/white burn decks have been a mainstay in Modern, known for their efficiency, speed, and ability to run over opponents with a mix of aggressive creatures and cheap “burn” spells that perform direct damage to a player’s life total. Thanks to a critical mass of Lightning Bolts and similar spells, burn was considered one of Modern’s fastest-winning decks due to its realistic ability of ending a game on turn three.</p>

<p id="OaukYr">However, since the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22537203/magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-2-best-cards-asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar"><em>Modern Horizons 2</em></a> in 2021, traditional burn decks failed to remain competitive while other Modern decks received substantial upgrades and powerful new strategies emerged. Though many burn players continued to register their decks in tournaments, the strategy itself remained stagnant, struggling to keep up as the Modern format’s power level gradually evolved and pushed the deck out of winners’ circles. </p>
<h2 id="cwtugh"><strong>Synergies and metagame impact</strong></h2>
<p id="ZXR4lN">Not only does Phlage reapply the Lightning Helix effect on a new card type, it also fits well with burn’s current play patterns. Burn decks rely heavily on one-and-done instants and sorceries, which quickly fill the graveyard while executing on burn’s primary strategy, in turn making the titan’s escape cost a realistic endgame after the burn player exhausts their other resources. </p>
<p id="b3zfNB">Since casting and escaping Phlage presents six damage on its own, it’s easy to imagine the remaining 14 damage needed to kill an opponent might have been done already with the cards used to escape it from the graveyard. If casting the card twice isn’t enough to win the game by itself, each additional attack presents nine more damage, a formidable threat against even the players who managed to somehow gain life back after getting burned.</p>
<h2 id="xPCcDY"><strong>New outlets for energy tokens</strong></h2>
<p id="JBSlBI">Another exciting reveal from <em>MH3 </em>is the return of energy tokens, a mechanic first introduced in 2016’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/15/12935316/magic-the-gathering-kaladesh-exclusive-mtg-vehicle-preview-cards-set-spoiler"><em>Kaladesh</em></a>, but which hadn’t been used again until earlier this year in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24139124/mtg-fallout-best-selling-commander-set-ever">Universes Beyond<em> Fallout Commander</em> decks</a>.</p>
<p id="0TzFKC">Unlike most other counters in <em>Magic</em>, which are placed on creatures or permanents, energy counters are given to a player directly, often as an added perk of a card’s effect. Once a certain number of energy counters are collected, they can be used as an additional resource to enhance cards that care about energy payoffs. </p>
<p id="ePcENM">Case in point: Amped Raptor and Voltstorm Angel. </p>

<p id="KAxS3Z">The long-term playability of energy cards in <em>MH3 </em>remains to be seen, however, since they’ve essentially been nonexistent in competitive metagames in the years since they were first introduced. Although a powerful energy-based deck used to exist when <em>Kaladesh</em> was legal in <em>Magic</em>’s standard format, they never made the leap to more powerful environments such as Modern or Pioneer.</p>
<p id="czjEvl">Although Voltstorm Angel is likely designed for games of <em>MH3</em> draft, Amped Raptor might be worth keeping an eye on if a red energy deck exists. </p>
<p id="TDiYn6">The raptor’s effect when it enters the battlefield allows the player to cast additional cards for free, off the top of the library, by spending energy counters in place of mana. Pairing it with deck manipulation effects that can put specific cards on top of the library, along with other spells that provide enough counters to cast anything that’s revealed off the raptor’s initial trigger, could let you “cheat” powerful and expensive cards into play before you have enough lands to cast it with traditional mana. </p>
<p id="WhyvPL"><em>Modern Horizons 3</em> pre-release events kick off at local game stores on June 7, followed by the official global tabletop release on June 14. </p>

So far, fans have only seen Hemsworth as the titular monster slayer in a blurry onset picture where he looked like he was dressed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://redanianintelligence.com/2024/05/08/exclusive-first-look-at-liam-hemsworth-geralts-new-outfit-in-the-witcher-season-4/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2024/05/08/exclusive-first-look-at-liam-hemsworth-geralts-new-outfit-in-the-witcher-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a costume from Halloween Spirit</a></span>. He looks a little more properly Witcher in the latest Netflix tease:</p><p>We don’t actually hear Hemsworth speak as Geralt, however, and that will be the biggest question surrounding him taking over of the role. Ever since CD Projekt Red turned author Andrzej Sapkowski’s books into hit video games where Geralt was voiced by Doug Cockle, the character’s been associated with a low, raspy, cool-as-a-cucumber-sounding stoic warrior. Cavill put his own spin on that approach, but mostly stuck with the gravelly, low voice. Whether Hemsworth will try that as wellor create a brand-new take on the character remains to be seen. </p><p>Cavill departing the show was a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-netflix-henry-cavill-season-4-superman-why-1849723343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-netflix-henry-cavill-season-4-superman-why-1849723343">huge controversy</a></span> back when it happened. The man behind Superman in Zack Snyder’s DCU appeared set to return to it before Warner Bros. completely upended those plans and handed the reigns over to James Gunn. Fans speculated that Cavill was ditching <em>The Witcher</em> series because he was unhappy with the creative liberties it was taking with the original text, but it seems more likely he just took some bad advice from his agent.

<p>TikTok is a touchy subject – and it has been so for at least the last four years. It started as a platform that hosted videos of teenagers dancing while miming songs but quickly became a melting pot of content creation, bizarre videos, pranks, gaming content, and everything in between. Today, it’s the biggest short-form video-sharing platform in the world, but it’s still a bit of a controversial application that angers the disapproving masses.</p>



<p>However, one category that excelled on TikTok was gaming. For the last three or four years, the application’s stranglehold on the gaming industry has gotten tighter, with creators leaning on the application to share short- and long-form videos, gain followers, and even live stream their gameplay.</p>



<p>Recently, data was revealed showcasing the top 500 games on the app. I’m willing to bet you’ll never guess the most popular game on TikTok.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-is-boss">Battle Royale is Boss</h2>



<p>In a data pull, a platform called mindGAME revealed the top 500 games on TikTok by total views and video counts. </p>



<p>At the top of the table sat Garena Free Fire, a mobile-based battle royale game that has never really excelled above the likes of PUBG, Fortnite, or Warzone in the general popularity stakes. It’s dramatically successful in some regions – such as Southeast Asia – and as an esports-focused game, it once held the record for the most concurrent viewers for an esports tournament <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mindgame-data_free-data-as-part-of-the-composite-mindshare-activity-7197053706310197248-yLVx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the data</a>, it was revealed that <strong>in total </strong>on TikTok, Garena Free Fire has amassed a count of 888 <strong>billion </strong>views spread across 87.3 million videos. In second place sits Roblox with 595 billion views on 66 million videos. Fortnite has wound up in third place with 591 million views on 60 million videos.</p>



<p>By comparison, Call of Duty Warzone doesn’t even make it into the top ten – neither does Grand Theft Auto 5. The likes of Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six Siege were edged out by Among Us and Genshin Impact, and single-player epics like Red Dead Redemption 2, Elden Ring, and The Last of Us are sitting somewhere in the 30 – 40 range. </p>



<p>Some fast risers have entered the list in recent weeks. For instance, Manor Lords has hit 28 million views across 1,700 videos, and Arena Breakout: Infinite has secured 14.9 million views also with around 1,700 videos.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of gaming real estate to be secured on TikTok, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Moments ago, a new website surfaced that’s reportedly the first teaser content for Black Ops 6 – if that’s indeed what the next Call of Duty game will be called. It’s called <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘thetruthlies.com’</a>, and it’s a relatively confusing little thing. On the site, there’s a retro television – like a CCTV monitor of sorts – that showcases a ‘found footage’ style video. </p>



<p>In this video, we see unidentified operatives traversing a federal location through the night – which is later revealed to be Mount Rushmore. They deface the monument silently in the blackness of night, before filming from a distance as their work is uncovered. They’ve hung banners stating ‘the truth lies’ over the faces of Mount Rushmore, while a fourth banner shows the wolf symbol that was revealed recently to announce the upcoming Call of Duty showcase.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cryptic-teaser">Cryptic Teaser</h2>



<p>There are a few things you can do and learn from The Truth Lies:</p>











<p>If you turn off the TV using the power button, you hear a foreboding, pulsing soundtrack in the background – which doesn’t tell you much. </p>



<p>If you flick through the channels, you’ll see that there are six. That could be a nod to ‘Black Ops’, or it could mean that five further teasers are set to be revealed. </p>



<p>Hitting ‘REC’ allows you to download the video that’s currently playing, which is a nice feature that’s guaranteed to get shares on social platforms.</p>



<p>Inspecting the page source doesn’t give much away, and from what we can see, there’s nothing else of any importance on the site.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>What appears to be the first teaser for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">next Call of Duty game</a> has arrived. Charlie Intel discovered a website for <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"The Truth Lies"</a> that appears to point to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-rumored-to-be-black-ops-5-is-coming-to-game-pass-report/1100-6523538/" data-ref-id="1100-6523538">rumored Black Ops 6.</a></p><p>A video on the website shows people climbing Mt. Rushmore to drape bandanas over the Presidents that say "The Truth Lies." A fourth bandana has what appears to be the Black Ops logo that was seen previously in Microsoft's announcement for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-airs-june-9-followed-by-mystery-event/1100-6523072/" data-ref-id="1100-6523072">mystery event in June.</a></p><p>The Black Ops series is known for its many mysteries and for digging into conspiracy theories, so the messaging is certainly on brand for the franchise, if this is indeed a Black Ops 6 teaser. Activision is known for its elaborate and multi-stage announcements for new Call of Duty games, and this appears to be the first step in the announcement process for this year's Call of Duty game.</p><p>Black Ops 6, or whatever the game is, is likely to release in October, according to reports. It will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-rumored-to-be-black-ops-5-is-coming-to-game-pass-report/1100-6523538/" data-ref-id="1100-6523538">launch on Game Pass, according to The Wall Street Journal.</a></p><p dir="ltr">The story for Black Ops 6 is rumored to take place, at least in part, during the Gulf War. Call of Duty games are known to be globetrotting affairs that travel through numerous locations--and time periods. So if the Gulf War is part of the game's story, it could be just one element of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors have suggested the new game has been in the works for a long time and will be the first game in franchise history to have been <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1782123698893279545">developed over a four-year period</a>. This lies in stark contrast to 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-was-developed-on-a-very-rushed-schedule-report/1100-6519074/">reportedly made in just 18 months.</a></p><p dir="ltr">If this year's game is indeed a Black Ops title, it will be the sixth entry in the series since it debuted in 2010. The Black Ops franchise within Call of Duty has become one of the most popular of all, and lucrative, too. Dave Anthony, the director of the first two Black Ops games, recently discussed how he made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-boss-lists-bel-air-mansion-for-astronomical-price-see-inside/1100-6523192/">"incredible amounts of money"</a> during his career.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of returning characters, it's rumored that Adler is coming back, but that's all we know so far. The Black Ops series is known for featuring real-life people, like Ronald Reagan (Black Ops Cold War) and Robert McNamara (Black Ops 1), so it wouldn't be surprising to see real-life military and political leaders from the Gulf War era appear in the new game.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-gulf-war-campaign-open-world/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> said Raven Software is developing the game's campaign, with Treyarch--the creator of the Black Ops series--handling multiplayer and Zombies. Activision is known to recruit teams from across its entire network of Call of Duty studios to contribute to each year's new release in some fashion, and that formula is expected to continue this year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">everything we know about the next Call of Duty. </a>Whatever the game turns out to be, it will join Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, and Call of Duty: Mobile on the market at the same time.</p>

                <p>Super Smash Bros. players are well-known for their strong opinions on character balance, and it seems that Masahiro Sakurai is no different. In a recent video on game design, Sakurai says that trying to make everything "fair" will produce a less interesting game. Or, as he puts it: "Average and mediocre are the same thing."</p><p>In the video, Sakurai explains that having characters with different sets of strengths and weaknesses gives the game a sense of "push-and-pull." He cites an example of a Mario vs. Mario mirror match--while it resolves these "balance issues," it also creates a static experience. He also calls the internet an "echo chamber of sorts," stating that players tend to believe community opinions of relative strength, even when they aren't necessarily true.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW4x-_Y8BmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KW4x-_Y8BmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To support his arguments, Sakurai revealed some interesting data regarding the relative win rates of each character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-480957">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> online matches. He reports that the highest win rate of a character in the game is 51.43%, while the lowest is 47.18%, a difference of around 4%. The director is clearly happy with this data, concluding it as follows: "any fighter has a shot at winning a match." So, the next time your hardcore Smash friend makes fun of you for picking a low-tier like Little Mac, try sending them this video.</p><p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the latest entry in the series, first came out in 2018 and received regular DLC updates until late 2021. While the future of the series is unknown, Sakurai said in a video released earlier this year that he's working on another project, which may indicate that Smash 6 is in development in some form or fashion. Sakurai did say he was going to step away from the series after Ultimate, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-on-franchises-future-i-cant-imagine-a-smash-bros-title-without-me/1100-6516378/" data-ref-id="1100-6516378">indicated</a> last year that he "can't imagine [a Smash game] without me." So, if there is another Smash game, it's almost certain that Sakurai will be involved.</p>

        <p>But StreamElements reports Rust enjoyed 19 million hours increase thanks to Waves of Change update</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>The latest StreamElements report reveals that Twitch users watched 1.64 billion hours of livestreamed footage in April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-hours-watched-drop-another-5-in-march">Last month's report</a> put March's total viewing hours at 1.56 billion, but StreamElements and Rainmaker.gg have since updated the data, showing that April is actually 7% down on the 1.77 billion hours recorded in the previous month.</p>
<p>Similarly, daily hours watched were down 5% from 57 million to 55 million. In fact, the number of daily hours watched has dropped slightly each month this year.</p>
<p>The declines can be attributed to a quiet April, with no major game releases or events to deliver a boost.</p>
<p>While Fallout games have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallout-4-jumps-to-no1-across-europe-following-tv-show-launch">rocketed up both the physical and digital charts</a> in the UK and Europe, these titles do not appear in the Top 10 most watched categories, which are instead led by Just Chatting (238 million hours watched) and Grand Theft Auto 5 (128 million), as well as live service games such as Fortnite, Counter-Strike GO and League of Legends.</p>
<p>Only two of the Top 10 categories saw an increase in hours watched, with Rust seeing the biggest increase month-on-month. The game's Waves of Changes update pushed viewing hours up by 227% — or 19 million hours to put it into context.</p>
<p>Total hours watched for Rust came in at 27 million, putting it at No.9. Call of Duty Warzone was at No.8 with 33 million hours — the only other game to see an increase at 19%.</p>
<p>"April was a slow month with few significant events and no major game launches, but Rust's massive update provided one notable peak among the valleys regarding viewership," said StreamElements co-founder Or Perry.</p>
<p>"Jynxzi was another highlight by being the first creator to be a top streamer twice in 2024 and putting him on the short list of recurring crown wearers, like xQc, Gaules, KaiCenat, and fps_shaka."</p>

Existing exclusivity agreements may typically involve support for funding, localization, marketing, and distribution – Nintendo could now promise assistance from a first-party specialist developer on top.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo will have to navigate an extended cross-gen period</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Games Addressable Market Metrics Database </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">estimates that 104 million Nintendo Switch consoles will remain in active use by the end of 2024.

With its audience split between new and old generations of hardware in the first half of its new console cycle, Nintendo may wish to release Switch versions of select titles originally planned for “Switch 2”.

The company, which owns a wide array of board and tabletop game developers, publishers, and distributors, took on €900 million in debt as part of the separation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will that debt weigh down a company carrying a major chunk of the sector on its back? According to former Embracer interim chief operations officer Matt Karch, the answer is "no."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Asmodee's a company that can handle debt, and that's where all the debt's going to be" the CEO (and founder) of Saber Interactive said in a recent conversation with Game Developer about the past and future of former Embracer subsidiary Saber Interactive. He'd been in the midst of praising Embracer's split into a trio of companies, and opined that the decision to assign the debt to Asmodee was likely to pay off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's more to glean from Karch's comments—what is it that makes Asmodee so good at handling debt, and what might it mean for its sibling corporations?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opinion-embracer-s-plan-for-the-lord-of-the-rings-is-bad-for-everyone" target="_self">Opinion: Embracer's plan for The Lord of the Rings is bad for everyone</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does it mean that Asmodee is &quot;good&quot; at paying debt?">What does it mean that Asmodee is "good" at paying debt?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news of Asmodee's financing made some industry observers nervous. It ostensibly resembled a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/opinion/private-equity.html">widely-criticized</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> corporate tactic: the private equity-driven practice of acquiring companies then saddling them with the debt needed to finance the purchase. The practice allows the new owner to extract value from the company's assets while forcing it to divert resources to paying down the debt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even if you're not familiar with such financial mechanisms, it's possible to interpret this move as one that makes Asmodee responsible for the financial mishaps that put Embracer in such a precarious position. Is that actually the case?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Probably not, said Dr. Mejda Bahlous-Boldi, an associate professor at Ithaca College and director of School of Business' Investment Program. We'd asked Bahlous-Boldi to weigh in on Karch's comments and evaluate what it meant for a firm like it to be good at handling debt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A company is well prepared to handle or manage debt if they can generate enough cashflows to service the debt," he explained. "A company that doesn’t have already a lot of debt will more likely be able to manage a debt."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of the spinoff, Embracer reported that Asmodee saw net sales of SEK 14.8 billion (about $1.4 billion), and "adjusted EBIT of SEK 1.9 billion on a pro forma basis as per LTM[2] as of December 2023."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's about on par with the $1.22 billion in sales it reported in its 2023 financial release and the $1.27 billion it reported in 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bahlous-Boldi explained that analysts paying attention to Asmodee's financial picture are studying D/E (debt to equity) and TIE ratios (TIE is equal to EBIT/ interest expenses of 1 year). If Asmodee is prepared to manage the debt, its D/E ratio should be lower than industry averages, and its TIE ratio higher than industry averages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After reviewing Embracer's split, Bahlous-Boldi speculated that the deal was structured this way because "not all divisions are expected to be successful and the parent company is better off splitting into 3 companies." Asmodee's status as a profitable and successful division made it the best candidate to shoulder the burden.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, Bahlous-Boldi warned that Asmodee will need to generate even more profits to pay off the debt, as the company is using money raised from the financing to pay dividends to Embracer. "From my opinion, the tax motive is credible," he concluded.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does this debt mean for the different arms of Embracer?">What does this debt mean for the different arms of Embracer?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Asmodee is the most successful of Embracer's three children, which might be the least that it's covering for? That unfortunately may be Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Middle-Earth Enterprises &amp; Friends bundles together all of Embracer's triple-A studios and the company in possession of The Lord of the Rings brand. On paper, it has the most well-known and possibly most valuable franchises of the three companies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In practice, it's shouldering some of the studios that faced arduous struggles in the last decade. These include Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montreal, two excellent former subsidiaries of Square Enix that released high-quality games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but were regularly dinged for "not meeting expectations" by its former parent company (who deserves more of a fair share of the blame for setting impossible expectations and pressing Crystal Dynamics to pivot to live service development with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Avengers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Large franchises like Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>should</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> be the strongest performers in the division, but games set in the latter franchise have been struggling with infamous, high-profile </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lord-of-the-rings-gollum-devs-describe-alleged-hostile-work-culture">stumbles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of late, and the Tomb Raider franchise will need time to reap the benefits of a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fleabag-creator-phoebe-waller-bridge-to-produce-tomb-raider-show-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge-produced series at Amazon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

It also gets to ride on the quietly high-profile revenue stream from Easybrain, which Karch boasted was "worth over a billion dollars" all on its own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Embracer's pivot works, then Asmodee's debt leveraging can help Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends find stability in unstable times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Readers most interested in the fate of Embracer's still-massive portfolio of studios are probably still on edge about the possibility of more layoffs and closures punishing developers for the financial mistakes made by people way above their pay grade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, it's many of the same executives who led Embracer to calamity that will be executing this new plan.

<p data-characters="436" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s</em> fourth season introduced just a few crumbs of what could be called “seasonal mechanics,” but what’s there is still pretty fun. From the Profane Mindcage, which boosts enemy levels in Helltides by 10 to the Momentum Elixir that let’s you zoom across the battlefield after scoring kills, there’s no shortage of new twists to blasting enemies. But one seems to be standing out from the rest. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">The <strong>Elixir of Holy Bolts</strong> asks, “what if Artillery Shrine, but all the time?” It causes damaging bolts to explode out of any enemy killed, (usually) dealing enough damage to kill another enemy, which <em>also</em> fires out bolts, killing <em>another</em> enemy and.. you get the idea. It’s essentially a cascade of death in any high-density areas. </p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">This strategy excels most of all in The Pit, <em>Diablo 4’s</em> new endgame activity. Enemies are packed so tightly together that starting a Holy Bolt chain-reaction is sometimes enough to clear entire sections of the map at once. It’s so powerful it could be a “seasonal mechanic” in its own right, if only it didn’t last 15 minutes. </p>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="false">The good news is that once your time’s up you can easily get more Elixirs by trading 350 Obols to the Alchemist under the “Seasonal Elixir” tab for another. It’s a hefty price, to be sure, but the power gains and time saved clearing Pit runs is worth it in my opinion. Of course, you can also score these as drops from Helltide Elites and bosses. Whatever you do, keep at least one in your back pocket for those broom closets of baddies.</p>
