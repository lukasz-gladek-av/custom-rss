			<p>A new&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid Delta vs Metal Gear Solid 3 comparison video has been released, showing the massive upgrades players can expect from the remake.</p>
<p>Konami debuted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-new-trailer-provides-an-impressive-new-look-at-the-boss-more-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trailer for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> during Microsoft's Xbox showcase earlier this month. This trailer showed some impressive visuals, and as discovered by Eurogamer's Digital Foundry, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-native-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown running at native 4K resolution</a>. Digital Foundry's analysis also included some comparison footage, highlighting how the remake will retain the Metal Gear Solid 3's original scene composition.</p>
<p>YouTube channel '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDebits</a>' has now released a comparison video of its own, in which the visuals of the original 2004 title are compared to the visuals of Delta as shown in the Xbox showcase trailer. This comparison video shows massive enhancements to the game's character models, animations, environments, gunplay, and the new camera system. We've included the new Metal Gear Solid Delta vs MGS3 comparison video below. Check it out and tell us what you think. Are you excited about the upcoming remake?</p>

<p>Officially announced during Sony's 2023 PlayStation showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta was first thought to be released sometime this year. Recent rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-slip-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have suggested that the game might slip to 2025</a>. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>We've included some additional details about the highly-anticipated remake below:</p>
<div>
<p><strong><em>Everything you love, and more</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music that made the original a sensation return, remade for modern consoles. This evolutionary leap breathes new life into every cutscene, and rebuilds every corner of the world.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-streaming-seems-to-be-available-directly-on-xbox-game-pass-for-certain-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On February 21, 2023, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-to-bring-all-its-xbox-pc-games-to-geforce-now-including-activision-blizzards-if-the-deal-passes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with NVIDIA to bring its PC games to the GeForce NOW cloud platform. The move was ostensibly directed at regulators, who were in the middle of the regulatory process for Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but it was also very beneficial for consumers.</p>
<p>A few months later, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-is-coming-to-geforce-now-albeit-with-select-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took the obvious next step</a>, slowly starting to allow PC Game Pass subscribers to play games through GeForce NOW for select games. The list greatly expanded over time.</p>
<p>However, the integration between the two services might be about to get even tighter, even on the console side. Several users have <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-appears-as-a-option-on-the-store-for-xbox-cloud-streaming.914415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> seeing an option to stream games like Street Fighter 6, Resident Evil Village, and Call of Duty Warzone with GeForce NOW from their Xbox consoles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GRIonhZakAArLmQ-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>


<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GRJgMhXWsAAGTfA-HD-art-width-3839px-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>


<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GRJdGs8bIAAg9og-HD-art-width-3839px-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This is surprising, to say the least. GeForce NOW is, after all, a competitor of sorts for Game Pass Ultimate, which includes the streaming feature based on XCloud. However, GeForce NOW is verifiably superior, offering peerless streaming quality with support for 4K resolution, HDR displays, up to 240 frames per second, integrated Reflex and <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-granblue-fantasy-relink-day-passes-and-cloud-g-sync-nvidia-reflex-support-for-60-120-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-SYNC</a> technologies, and support for ray tracing/DLSS, depending on the tier used. XCloud, on the other hand, is still limited to 1080p (Full HD) resolution and 60 frames per second. The difference is largely due to the server hardware used in the respective configurations. Whereas XCloud servers <a href="https://wccftech.com/xcloud-servers-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are based on Xbox Series X specs</a>, GeForce NOW's Ultimate tier <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-ada-powers-geforce-now-servers-5x-faster-than-xbox-series-x-with-rt-dlss3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs on RTX 4080-class hardware</a>, which is estimated to be five times as fast.</p>
<p>Is this a sign of Microsoft yielding to NVIDIA's superior service and stopping investments in its own streaming technology? It's too early to say at this point. We've reached out to NVIDIA and only got a 'nothing to share at this time' response, which suggests an announcement might be on the way. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

			<p>Four years ago I reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/04/morbid-the-seven-acolytes-review/">Morbid: The Seven Acolytes</a>, a really enjoyable and challenging top-down Souls-like that contained some fantastic eldritch creature designs and an interesting range of combat approaches. Fast forward to today and I’ve now finished playing the Lords of Ire, a somewhat surprising sequel that shifts the perspective to a more traditional third person&nbsp;one. Given my positive experience with the first game I expected this one to have plenty of ideas of its own to warrant looking past the uncanny similarities with FromSoft’s output but was this the case?</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid: The Lords of Ire Demo - Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ls32sPlxIVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While changing the aesthetic so drastically could be a risky strategy the core designs are relatively faithful to the Lovecraftian nightmares of the original game. Given the smaller budget and resources of the developers the game holds up pretty well graphically too. The returning heroine, The Striver, makes for an imposing presence whilst NPCs are grotesque and memorable. A regular pattern of finding these in levels before they return to your hub makes for nice gradual progression with the first managing to make it back despite having had their legs and face chewed off by evil creatures. Sound design is solid too with attacks having a decent weight to them and atmospheric effects really setting the scene. Voice acting and music are good too.</p>


<p>The storyline and lore here is pitched somewhere between a continuation and a reboot of the original game. Once again you are a mysterious solitary warrior who must go forth and slay a series of monstrous acolytes to free the land from their tyranny. Rather than a fully continuous world the action takes place in a series of self contained zones that are accessed via the hub once unlocked. This feels very FromSoft and is a proven approach. Areas benefit from some well designed shortcuts and there are many threats and traps littered around the environment that will prove lethal to the unsuspecting adventurer. Each area has a very distinct design – in fact sometimes too distinct as there is a certain lack of tonal consistency here. Alongside the stereotypical snowy and fiery areas later environments take huge inspiration from the giants of the genre with a Gothic townscape that is straight out of Yharnam.</p>


<p>Combat takes a little getting used to as despite following many of the standard approaches of the genre there are some idiosyncrasies of its own. Standard light and heavy attacks abound with defending and counter attacking being a viable approach too. As you progress through the game, however, it becomes clear that much of the combat is heavily biased towards the riposte mechanic. This technique is activated through holding the block button and tapping light attack just as the enemy is about to strike you. Whilst many enemies can be defeated without this it becomes essential later on, especially against bosses whose HP pools are too large to whittle down. The positive to this approach is that it does reward learning enemy attacks and working out the correct timing but it does make mobs a test of memory rather than anything else.</p>
<p>At its best, Morbid: Lords of Ire sets waves of different enemies your way and working out the safest and most efficient way to dispatch them feels great. However, towards the end of the game there did seem to be long sections with the same basic enemy repeated ad infinitum and the pattern of riposting became monotonous. This is a shame as that section is capped off with some memorable environments and a really challenging final boss. These kinds of niggles perhaps show the difference between the solid Souls-like and the games that they are influenced by.</p>

<p>To combat the hordes of vile beasts you find a pretty extensive range of weapons of different types from close quarter brass knuckles to ludicrous two handed war hammers. Weapons vary in damage and impact, the latter of which affects enemy posture bars. The pattern of ripostes does make any build viable in theory but weapon upgrades are limited by the amount of runestones available throughout the level so once you invest in one weapon it becomes difficult to switch to another. I also found the issues with heavy weapons from the first game continued here as they were too slow and stamina intensive to be effective.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Morbid: Lords of Ire is not a game that’ll usurp the FromSoft throne in any way but it is a very solid and enjoyable second tier Soulslike that stands alongside titles like Thymesia and is well worth the relatively cheap entry price for genre fans. It takes clear influence from Sekiro in its parry based combat but is relatively accessible for players who might bounce off that game’s difficulty level.	</p></div>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-banned-from-twitch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nickmercs-banned-from-twitch-days-after-dr-disrespect-scandal.915057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-banned-from-twitch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Nick ‘Nickmercs’ Kolcheff has been banned from Twitch for the first time following the use of a ‘derogatory slur’ on the platform. The ban came suddenly and just days after the recent controversy surrounding Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm, who admitted to messaging a minor on the platform back in 2017, an event that led to his permanent Twitch ban in 2020.</p>



<p>Kolcheff was caught using a transphobic slur on stream, uttering the word ‘tranny’, which was quickly followed up with a decisive but temporary ban. He fired back on social media stressing that ‘next time (he’ll) use mental health disorder.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-under-fire-again">Under Fire Again</h2>



<p>It’s an entire year since Nickmercs was last in hot water for transphobic comments. Last June, he commented in response to transgender rights protesters, stating that ‘They should leave little children alone.’ It was a situation that unravelled and led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-call-of-duty/">his custom skin being stripped from Call of Duty</a> – but unlike the recent Dr Disrespect situation, many stood in solidarity with Nickmercs. When he returned to streaming after the event, he landed a record-high number of paid subscriptions on Twitch.</p>



<p>Recently, Kolcheff appeared on stream saying ‘there’s no such thing as trans people’, before ultimately uttering the slur that landed him his first-ever Twitch ban. </p>



<p>In the wake of Dr Disrespect’s recent scandal, during which he admitted inappropriately messaging a minor on the platform in 2017, Nickmercs spoke strongly against it, stressing that he can no longer support the veteran streamer. </p>



<p>It’s unclear how long Nickmercs’ Twitch ban will last.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-layoffs-hit-ubisoft-as-company-tries-to-deliver-roadmap.915045/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been announced that Ubisoft Toronto has been hit by a fresh wave of layoffs that have seen 33 employees lose their jobs. This comes as a result of Ubisoft trying to commit to delivering ‘on its ambitious roadmap’, a statement said. It’s the same reasoning we’ve heard time and again over the last eighteen months, as almost 20,000 industry workers have been made redundant worldwide. It almost always comes down to a restructuring or a re-alignment with a roadmap – and more often than not, it’s an ‘ambitious’ roadmap.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-repetition">Repetition</h2>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/">we posted an exposé</a> on the state of play at Ubisoft, talking about the internal tensions felt by teams everywhere. In November 2023, more than 100 employees were cut from the business, and before that, around 60 employees were impacted by layoffs across a series of offices in the United Kingdom and North America. In February, Ubisoft workers in France started striking to drive negotiations for better salaries.</p>



<p>This latest wave has struck Ubisoft Toronot, the studio recently brought on to work on the Sands of Time remake. In a statement <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/less-than-a-month-after-joining-work-on-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-toronto-lays-off-33-employees-to-ensure-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by PC Gamer</a>, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft Toronto has decided to conduct a targeted realignment to ensure it can deliver on its ambitious roadmap. Unfortunately, this will impact the roles of 33 team members who will be leaving Ubisoft. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to them, including severance and career assistance, to help through this transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been a wildly unfortunate year and a bit for the gaming industry, with studios closing their doors after decades of business, projects being canned after years of work, and thousands of employees being turfed out without much warning. Ubisoft Toronto is the latest in a long line of studios to be hit by this trend.</p>

<p>Recently leaked images have suggested that Xbox consoles could be getting a direct integration with Nvidia GeForce Now in the near future. On social media, a series of shots surfaced showing the option to play certain games through GeForce Now, which is Nvidia’s cloud-based streaming service. Historically, Microsoft and Nvidia have partnered on this proposition, but this would be the first time that a native application has worked itself onto the Xbox platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-games">More Games</h2>



<p>On Twitter, known tipster ‘eXtas1s’ posted a series of images that showed players having the option to boot games through GeForce Now, alongside the usual offerings such as Game Pass or outright purchasing:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 OJOOO 🚨</p><p>¿Nvidia GeForce Now integrado en Xbox?</p><p>Parece que un acuerdo más grande se esconde entre Xbox y Nvidia, y su anuncio puede ser inminente.</p><p>Varios juegos desde la tienda Xbox da la opción de "jugarlo con GeForce Now". Profundizaremos en un vídeo hoy. <a href="https://t.co/blBFMVGXpm">pic.twitter.com/blBFMVGXpm</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/1806686104852025581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Translated, the post reads:</p>



<p><em>‘<strong>Nvidia GeForce Now integrated into Xbox?</strong> It seems that a bigger deal is lurking between Xbox and Nvidia, and its announcement may be imminent. Several games from the Xbox store give the option to “play it with GeForce Now.”‘</em></p>



<p>It was a while ago that Microsoft partnered with Nvidia to bring Game Pass titles and games from the Microsoft Store to GeForce Now. The platform from Nvidia allows users to stream games to almost any device if they own them through the Microsoft Store or Game Pass. However, this latest development could mean that games listed on Nvidia GeForce Now will be available to stream on Xbox consoles using a native application. </p>



<p>It’s no big secret that these tech titans are investing in the future of cloud gaming. Recently, we touched upon a discussion concerning blueprint images of Microsoft’s all-cloud-based console that was canned years ago – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-keystone-images-revealed/">Project Keystone</a>.</p>

King of Fighters and Fatal Fury were hugely popular beat-’em-ups in the 1980s and ’90s, while Metal Slug helped define the side-scrolling action game genre, and the company’s high-spec console, handheld and arcade hardware were the envy of many. </p><p>After two tumultuous decades in the 2000s, SNK received investment from Saudi Arabia’s Electronic Gaming Development Company in 2020 and was fully acquired in 2022. The investment has come under scrutiny due to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, which includes allegations of unfair treatment of women and the LGBTQ community. In the aftermath of the acquisition, an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SNK lead insisted that the studio's new ownership "doesn't affect us in any way."</a></p><p>Shortly after the opening of a new development studio in Singapore in April, IGN spoke with SNK President and CEO Kenji Matsubara about the company’s vision, which includes becoming a Top 10 global publisher.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/snk-ceo-1719596433009.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SNK President and CEO Kenji Matsubara. Photo credit: Daniel Robson/IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Matsubara’s goal is ambitious, but the company does of course face extremely stiff competition. Depending on the definition, the world’s largest game publisher is currently Sony Interactive Entertainment, with the Top 10 also including Microsoft, Nintendo and Electronic Arts. The group also includes relative newcomers from China such as Tencent, NetEase and miHoYo.</p><p>“Setting such a lofty goal has helped me to identify the challenges that stand in our way,” he says. “What SNK currently lacks the most is development capabilities, so strengthening development capabilities will be essential. Beyond that, we can also consider acquiring other studios with strong IP, to add to our portfolio.”</p><p>SNK’s next announced game is <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, the first new entry in the Fatal Fury series in 26 years. After nearly three decades away, the new game is attracting a positive response from fans of fighting games – but Matsubara acknowledges this alone will not be enough.</p><p>“It will be necessary for us to develop titles in various genres and release multiple titles every year,” he says. “We are also working on genres other than fighting games. We are planning not only action games that utilize SNK’s legacy IP, but also action games that are brand new, and we hope to start releasing these over the next few years.”</p><p>Matsubara joined SNK in July 2021. In the three years since, he has made significant changes, strengthening the company’s development, sales and publishing divisions. Headquartered in Osaka, the company also opened new development studios in Tokyo and, most recently, Singapore, with another studio already open in Beijing. Last year, its Osaka HQ changed location as well, leaving its longtime home for a larger, more centrally located office close to Shin-Osaka bullet train station. In terms of marketing and sales, Matsubara has increased the company’s focus from Asia to include more proactive efforts in the West.</p><p>As a geographically central location in Southeast Asia with a high level of English proficiency, stable economy and growing pool of tech talent, Singapore is becoming one of Southeast Asia’s most prominent locations for game development. In recent years, companies such as Ubisoft, Electronic arts and Bandai Namco have opened offices there, while locally developed indie games such as Cuisineer and Let’s Build a Zoo are taking Singapore’s soft-power culture to the world. Gaming peripheral makers such as Razer and Secretlab, too, have built a strong reputation for the country, while gamescom spinoff event gamescom asia has been held there for several years. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>SNK Singapore Office Photo Gallery</h3></div></output><p>As we spoke with Matsubara shortly after the opening of SNK’s new Singapore studio, we asked the reasons behind this choice of location.</p><p>“When I joined SNK, we only had studios in Osaka and Beijing,” he says. “We soon set up a Tokyo studio, but we felt we needed to increase the number of studios and work on strengthening our development capabilities. When we look to Asia, Singapore is the most attractive place. Engineers there are knowledgeable about generative AI and machine learning, which have been attracting attention in recent years, and they are interested in joining the videogame industry. So Singapore felt ideally suited for game development.”</p><p>Each of these studios undertake different tasks while also collaborating on certain projects. While the Singapore studio finds its feet, it has been twinned with the Tokyo studio, while also taking advantage of local knowhow to contribute development research to the group as a whole.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/snk-singapore-office-head-1719596394266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SNK Singapore studio head Tang Hong Sing at the studio’s opening ceremony in April</figcaption></figure></output><p>“For now, the Singapore studio and the Tokyo studio work together closely, holding regular meetings and collaborating on title development. In the future, I would like the Singapore studio to become a standalone studio, and to develop AAA titles as a hub studio for Southeast Asia.”</p><p>Matsubara also explained that the Singapore studio has a strong R&amp;D focus, particularly in the fields of generative AI and machine learning, which will feed back into the rest of the SNK group.</p><p>SNK also has sales bases in China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. But even with all of these new development and sales offices, the company’s plans for expansion continue to unfold. As SNK works towards its goals, it plans to eventually either open outposts in North America and Europe, or to build partnerships in those regions with other companies.</p><p>While SNK has a very long way to go to realize its aspirations of cracking the global Top 10 publishers, it is clearly no longer just a Japanese company. By embracing a multicultural approach and dabbling in new genres, there’s a good chance it will release some cool games. That in itself will be an important first step in once again making SNK a household name.</p><p><em>Daniel Robson is Chief Editor at IGN Japan and is </em><a href="https://twitter.com/nomoredaniels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>on Twitter here</em></u></a><em>.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="46KyEX">Actor Amitabh Bachchan is a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/22979071/best-hindi-movies-netflix-indian-bollywood-tamil-telugu">metaphorical giant of Indian cinema</a>, a superstar of proportions that dwarf even A-list American celebrities. In the Indian sci-fi epic <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em>, his stature becomes literal: In his role as the 7-foot-tall immortal warrior Ashwatthama, the 81-year-old towers over his younger co-stars, all of whom are draws in their own right. (A handy way for the uninitiated to measure the relative fame of an Indian actor is to note the length of their introduction in a movie — the bigger the name, the more elaborate the entrance.) The sheer amount of star power in this film is overwhelming, but that isn’t even the most ambitious thing about it. </p>
<p id="XEjX1f">Writer-director Nag Ashwin means for <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> to be nothing less than the ultimate sci-fi epic. Its scope is huge, covering 6,000 years of mythological history. Its run time is long, telling the first part of a two-part story over three jam-packed hours. (To be fair, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22733349/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet">Denis Villeneuve</a>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two"><em>Dune </em>movies</a> aren’t much shorter.) And its production was expensive — reportedly <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/kalki-2898-ad-exploring-nag-ashwin-prabhas-amitabh-bachchan-deepika-padukone-movie-1235942384/">around $72 million</a>, one of the biggest budgets ever for an Indian movie. The filmmakers hope it will be a crossover event akin to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23478046/rrr-ss-rajamouli-movies-top-gun-avengers-future">S.S. Rajamouli</a>’s record-breaking hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996870/rrr-review-rise-roar-revolt"><em>RRR</em></a>, not only within India’s disparate film industries (Bachchan is known as a Bollywood actor, while co-stars Prabhas and Kamal Haasan work in Telugu and Tamil films, respectively) but internationally as well. </p>
<p id="s4PQUd">The film’s look, rendered almost entirely through CGI, will certainly feel familiar to Western audiences, with elements that recall the beloved sci-fi franchises Blade Runner<em>, </em>Star Wars<em>, </em>The Matrix<em>, </em>Dune<em>, </em>and especially <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em>. </em>The story is more specifically Indian, taking the Hindu myth of Kalki — the 10th and final incarnation of the god Vishnu, who will come to lead humanity into a new era of peace and justice — and transporting it to a dystopian sci-fi setting. But while references to magical weapons and folkloric heroes may go over the heads of all but the best-informed foreign viewers, the story’s arc follows the familiar beats of a Chosen One narrative. </p>

<p id="879ump">This first chapter of the <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> saga spends much of its run time setting up its characters and world, beginning with a caravan of refugees arriving in the futuristic city of Kasi, the last outpost of civilization after droughts and pollution have rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Life is cheap in Kasi, where a single chicken egg fetches the same price as a human being on the black market. The one exception is fertile women, who have become extremely valuable in this dystopian future world: Whenever one is discovered, she’s sold and shipped off to the Complex, a floating pyramid above the city, where a wealthy minority hoard the few natural resources that are left. </p>
<p id="FdFG9k">SUM-80 (Deepika Padukone) is one of these women, and one of hundreds who live as lab rats at the pleasure of Supreme Yaskin (Haasan), a 200-year-old tyrant who extends his life by extracting a serum from the wombs of impregnated female captives. The women die in the process, but no matter; their corpses are thrown into an incinerator, and new girls take their place. SUM-80, understandably, wants to live, so she’s hiding her pregnancy from everyone around her. But it’s been five months, and the sadistic doctors who run this so-called Project K will notice soon. </p>
<p id="qf2UDv">Things are grim in a different way outside of the Complex, though affable bounty hunter Bhairava (Prabhas) does his best to keep the mood light. Indian films typically blend genres, and although <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> is more serious-minded than most Bollywood fare — there are no true musical numbers, sadly, though characters do lip-sync to Santhosh Narayanan’s original songs — Bhairava and his wisecracking AI companion Bujji (Keerthy Suresh) bring much-needed, Star Wars-esque comedic banter to the film. Bhairava is a Han Solo type, motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of cash, or “units.” Like Han, he’s also a ladykiller, as we learn when the similarly roguish Roxie (Disha Patani) enters the narrative. </p>

<p id="yh2pAB">At first, it isn’t clear how SUM-80, Bhairava, and 6,000-year-old badass Ashwatthama, who spends much of the movie hiding out in a cave, are connected. It’s never in doubt that they’ll meet up eventually, though, or that each of them will play their role in fulfilling the prophecy preached by a rebel group living in a hidden utopia known as Shambhala. Eventually, the action moves to the rebels’ sacred retreat. But first, SUM-80 must race across the wastelands, pursued by both Supreme Yaskin’s flunkies and Bhairava, who plans to exchange this precious hostage for admission to the Complex. </p>
<p id="m0x7k9">Some of the digital backgrounds VFX supervisor Praveen Kilaru and his team created for <em>Kalki 2898 AD</em> are absolutely stunning, and sci-fi fans who like nerding out on cool ships and badass vehicles will find a lot to get into here. (The design for Bujji, who can transform from a cool car to a cooler battle robot, is especially compelling.)</p>
<p id="kA5b7Y">But the fact that this is just the first part of a two-part story creates some serious structural issues. The first two hours of the film pass at a lively but unhurried clip, but the final hour tries to cram too much into an already overstimulating epic battle scene. It feels panicky and confused as it rushes through crucial plot developments and exposition. </p>

<p id="LOPOKK">Comparisons between <em>Kalki </em>and <em>RRR</em> are inevitable, if only because the former is nakedly trying to replicate the success of the latter. But Nag Ashwin’s film is missing a few of the elements that made<em> RRR</em> so charming: There’s no central bromance, no exhilarating dance sequences, and no sense of surprise. There is comedy, but it’s isolated in certain sections of the film, and there’s much less romance and music than audiences might expect. It’s still an entertaining ride, with some cool imagery and exciting chase scenes. But by channeling the gravitas of Western sci-fi movies, <em>Kalki 2898 AD </em>loses some of the range that makes Indian movies special. Its ambition is to be applauded. Its self-seriousness, not so much. </p>

            <p>Dune Imperium is a fabulous strategy game about becoming the biggest spice boy on a sandy planet I presume is called Dune. I love it despite never having read the Dune books or watched the Dune movies, because the digital version taught me everything I needed to know about Barry Harkonnen, Oscar Isaac, the tall guy from Guardians Of The Galaxy, and their insatiable pursuit of space nutmeg.
</p>
<p>Now the board game's first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it's called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rise Of Ix adds three new Great Houses - Moritani, Ecaz and Vernius - which have two new playable leaders each, all with unique special abilities. It also adds a new technology track to advance along, akin to the relationship tracks in the base game, as well as dreadnought ships which add a new layer of complexity to military conflicts.
</p>
<p>Dune Imperium is a deckbuilder and worker placement game, in which each player begins with two agents they can deploy on each turn by using cards, in order to accrue spice, moneybucks, water, or military strength. The aim is to gather victory points across up-to ten rounds of play, either by forming alliances with various factions (the Fremen, the Emperor, the red teleporty one, the purple one), winning battles against other players, or buying them via the card shop.
</p>
<p>I spent fifteen minutes playing half the tutorials in the digital version and then started actual matches, both against the computer and against a friend. Even as a total dummy, Imperium is graspable enough that I was able to conceive of and carry out a basic strategy from that very first match, which is all I need to have fun even if I'm losing. As it turns out, I do often lose, but the matches are typically close, with dramatic turnarounds and last-round comebacks. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure how Rise Of Ix's additions will interact with all those systems, but I'm excited to find out. The expansion is due to release second half of July, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1689500/view/4172103171348340066?l=english">according to the announcement</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alice-madness-returns-retrospective<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/16/alice-madness-returns-review">If Alice: Madness Returns was dead on arrival</a>, that would at least be aesthetically consistent. </p><p>The 2011 sequel to American McGee's Alice went even deeper into Alice in Wonderland's red guts than the first game, pulling out the most nightmarish aspects of the Victorian children's story and tying their shadows into a neat action-adventure. But it suffered from <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/958269-alice-madness-returns/59541273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>abysmal launch sales</u></a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alice-madness-returns"><u>reviewers</u></a> and <a href="https://www.xboxachievements.com/forum/topic/285759-i-had-forgotten-how-frustrating-ams-alice-was/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fans</u></a> both being disappointed by what they felt were rough controls and level design. </p><p>Still, game designer American McGee wasn't giving up. </p><p>McGee, who created the series after being fired by id Software, hoped to gather enough community support for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/04/american-mcgee-working-on-proposal-for-alice-3"><u>a follow-up</u></a>, and the most diehard Alice believers gave it to him in spades. But after a decade of this cutting fan pressure, publisher EA finally made a decision <a href="https://sea.ign.com/alice-madness-returns/197875/news/alice-madness-returns-sequel-alice-asylum-vetoed-out-by-ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>in 2023</u></a>: there would be no more Alice games. They blamed the "analysis of the IP" and market conditions. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Was it all over? Would Alice have to lie facedown in the graveyard once and for all? Not exactly. Alice: Madness Returns doesn't just live, it thrives. </p><p>"Even though EA was going to let Alice die," says 33-year-old Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/foxfire47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Foxfire47</u></a>, who has been a fan of the series since the first game released in 2000, "the fans were absolutely not." </p><p>She credits Madness Returns’ lively online fanbase to McGee himself. He began working on a proposal for a potential follow-up, Alice: Asylum, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/04/american-mcgee-working-on-proposal-for-alice-3"><u>in 2017</u></a>, and encouraged fans to contact EA directly to show their support. His now retired <a href="https://www.patreon.com/americanmcgee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Patreon</u></a> contains all the other ways he incentivized fans to deepen their obsession, like referring to the fandom as "Insane Children" and eventually posting an <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/alice-asylum-v1-78703655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alice: Asylum design bible bursting with art</u></a>. </p><p>His otherworldly design is at least one reason why fans could never truly abandon Madness Returns, or the Alice series in general. They are a gorgeous testament to the fact that anyone can survive the worst thing that's ever happened to them.  </p><h2>Friendships and bonds</h2><p>Foxfire47 discovered Madness Returns' online fan base through McGee's Patreon in 2018. She remembers feeling McGee’s excitement for Asylum bleeding into her preexisting enthusiasm for the series, and it did the same for everyone she met over Patreon and Discord. </p><p>"Friendships and bonds were made through Alice: Asylum," Foxfire47 says. </p><p>When EA ultimately passed on the project, they were also rejecting an entire community that had put years and money into materializing a shared dream. But McGee had trained his fans to become personally invested, and an IP issue seemed small in the face of their dedication. </p><p>"After [EA rejected Asylum]," Foxfire47 says, "I feel that, as fans for Alice, we wanted to keep the spirit of the games alive. With the camaraderie of this community, we are always going to show our love for these games."</p><p>The community now sustains Madness Returns through YouTube videos with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoTP3Mm25f0&amp;t=959s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>millions of views</u></a>, pouty <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@goth_hisu/video/7290846213056793886?_r=1&amp;_t=8jieOM2PhSU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TikTok fancams</u></a> with hundreds of thousands of likes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/l59k1b/alice_madness_returns_cosplay_by_le_atlass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>detailed cosplay</u></a>, tattoos, and other tangible methods of worship. All of this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/yokxk8/alice_madness_returns_still_holds_up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>online word-of-mouth</u></a> has helped Alice fans succeed in an unprecedented goal. They are actively collecting new fans for an abandoned, 24-year-old franchise telling the strange horror story of an orphan teenager, Alice, who retreats into an hallucinated Wonderland. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I feel that, as fans for Alice, we wanted to keep the spirit of the games alive</p></div><p>"I bought Alice: Madness Returns, and I’m playing the first one for the first time because of your cosplay!" one commenter recently told popular TikTok cosplayer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessilyncupcake?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jessilyn Cupcake</u></a>. In recent years, she's made and shared several Alice cosplays with her eager followers, including Alice's <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessilyncupcake/video/7012329847284403462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ultramarine tea dress</u></a> and the yowling Hobby Horse hammer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessilyncupcake/video/7353442984311934250?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>from Madness Returns</u></a>. She first found Madness Returns in 2011, telling IGN that she "fell in love immediately.”</p><p>"It still feels modern and a fresh take despite being 15 years old," Jessilyn says. "I think [its] hack-and-slash-style gameplay with multiple weapons, costumes, and abilities is one of the best examples in a game, ever." </p><p>The game is an intoxicating blend of deadly and delicate, much like its most famous weapon, the lace-patterned <a href="https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Vorpal_Blade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vorpal Blade – a chef's knife for short-range combat</u>.</a> In Madness Returns, traumatized 19-year-old Alice must take on the child sex trafficker and psychiatrist <a href="https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Angus_Bumby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dr. Bumby</u>, who</a> tries to trick her into madness in order to commodify her body. But Alice learns to wield her fragile power against any abomination. </p><p>Alice's ability to work through her pain and tackle any problem, from <a href="https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Bitch_Baby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>baby dolls</u></a> that vomit to dangerous men, is part of her underdog appeal. And McGee accessorizes Alice's hypnotic visions with touches like the creamy, white bow behind her bloodspattered apron, and the crystal-blue butterflies in the misty, tree-covered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeLmMaL5irk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vale of Tears.</u></a> </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/jessilyncupcake-cosplay-1719613659360.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Alice: Madness Returns has inspired memes, art, coplay, and more from its dedicated fanbase. Source: Jessilyn Cupcake.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though Madness Returns the game has been out for years, the most popular way for fans to publicly join together is by looking at the tiniest game details through a magnifying glass. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wqq_m/video/7111214136859593990?_r=1&amp;_t=8mA8lqlzqX8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>On TikTok</u></a>, a scene shows Alice hallucinates having her skull drilled open at the corrupt Rutledge Asylum. The camera lingers on swollen leeches in jars. Alice looks dazed in slow-motion, with makeup staining her skin like a bruise, and moved viewers supply the video with 43,000 likes. </p><p>"SAVE ALICE ASYLUM PETITION," says the most popular comment.</p><p>Madness Returns YouTube videos likewise prioritize analysis of the game's visuals and story. One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei4-s2F8hI0&amp;t=982s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>51-minute video</u></a> by video essayist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BoulderPunch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Boulder Punch</u></a> spends almost half of its runtime on series "highlights," praising its surreal platforming and aching orchestral score.</p><p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Blackrose128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>BlackRose</u></a> was among those captivated by its “beautiful, grungy artwork” when she recorded her first YouTube episode with it in 2023, leading her to recommend it to her 111,000 followers. </p><p>"I was immediately hooked," she tells IGN. "One particular part of the game that sticks with me vividly was when Alice became a giant after eating [enchanted Eat Me cake in] Queensland. I had loads of fun becoming big and terrorizing all the enemy card guards while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhuCks52XNM&amp;t=608s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>I laughed maniacally</u></a> for having so much power." </p><h2><strong>Master of the macabre</strong></h2><p>"The art direction of the two Alice games are definitely what struck me the most [about them] — that dark, gothic style that blends objects of childhood with violence and the macabre," says Maria, who runs the horror gaming YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eurothug4000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>eurothug4000</u></a>.</p><p>McGee's defunct Shanghai-based games studio, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/spicy-horse"><u>Spicy Horse</u></a>, specialized in the unique style that gave Alice life. Aside from the Alice series, the developer also (somewhat <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/06/american-mcgees-grimm-a-boy-who-learns-what-fear-is-review"><u>unpopularly</u></a>) turned several Brothers Grimm stories into platformers, while padding them with intriguing, cartoonish gore. But American McGee's: Alice is what truly established Spicy Horse as a purveyor of cute brooding. Madness Returns' art director <a href="https://www.kenart.net/portfolio/gameprojects.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ken Wong</u></a> was certainly inspired by it. </p><p>After Wong created Alice fanart in 2000, McGee took notice, and the two worked on designs together for several years. And on Madness Returns, "we saw an opportunity with the visuals to create something that was violent and horrific, yet also beautiful and full of imagination," Wong says. "Wonderland is such an amazing setting." </p><p>"I'm biased as the art director," Wong continues. "But in 2024, I think it's worth playing Madness Returns to experience a real visual feast. We were pushed to unleash our imaginations and explore some really dark places, and I think the game we created has some of the most beautiful environments and some of the most f'ed up characters I've ever seen in a game." </p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@leah___lbbh/video/7211327715461434670" data-video-id="7211327715461434670"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@leah___lbbh?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@leah___lbbh" rel="noopener noreferrer">@leah___lbbh</a> But recovering the truth is worth the suffering. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/seehergreatness?refer=embed" title="seehergreatness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SeeHerGreatness</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/alicemadnessreturns?refer=embed" title="alicemadnessreturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#alicemadnessreturns</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/alice?refer=embed" title="alice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#alice</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/madnessreturns?refer=embed" title="madnessreturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#madnessreturns</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/seehergreatness?refer=embed" title="seehergreatness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SeeHerGreatness</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Alice-Madness-Returns-7211327704958896939?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ Alice Madness Returns - °•💘💌 𝒜𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓎𝒶𝒽 💌💘•°" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ Alice Madness Returns - °•💘💌 𝒜𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓎𝒶𝒽 💌💘•°</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>Though the content of its story suggests defiance of its lineage, Madness Returns nonetheless shares its core with Alice in Wonderland, the idea that being a girl in an adult environment feels surreal. Because of this, actress Susie Brann, who voiced Alice in both games, tells IGN over email that she "wanted to bring to life the Alice [she'd] read about as a child."</p><p>"I saw her as frank, polite, well brought up, curious, honest and adventurous," says Brann. "I was aware that there was a great disparity between the innocence and truthfulness of Alice and the horror that was going on around her. But being aware that she had experienced real horror in the loss of her parents in such a horrific way, the games could be seen as an outworking of what was going on in her mind. Maybe bringing some form of closure, if not healing, to her mind."</p><p>The original Alice in Wonderland provides a roadmap to children hoping to detangle the bizarre world of grown-ups. Madness Returns has, in turn, become a cornerstone guide for women who've learned to become distrustful of the white rabbit that led them to it. Fans online <a href="https://chokit-pyrus.tumblr.com/post/189812838567/can-i-please-take-a-moment-to-rant-about-alice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gush</u></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1ckefpb/im_playing_alice_madness_returns_for_first_time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>about</u></a> the way Madness Returns handles trauma, which is, to this day, uncommonly nonjudgmental and empowering.While the villainous Bumby forces Madness Returns' Alice to suffer from gendered grief, she never allows it to infect all of who she is. She's more of a goth role model than a tragic hero, and in fans' appreciation of her, she's been able to join Alice in Wonderland as a fairytale classic. </p><p>Some fans have even grown up with Madness Returns the way other children, for more than a century, have had Alice in Wonderland read to them at bedtime. That was the case for twenty-two-year-old Johnnie, whose mom had been playing Alice games since before they were born. They first played it themselves when they were only five years old. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I'm biased as the art director, but in 2024, I think it's worth playing Madness Returns to experience a real visual feast</p></div><p>These days, Johnnie appreciates how "[Alice] isn't sexualized, demonized, or saved by a man," they say. "All of her healing is done on her own, and I've always loved and appreciated that. [...] <em>Alice</em> as a series, I believe, sparked a lot of discussion around trauma, psychosis, and mental health and provided that safe space for those who have suffered too without being painted as a villain."</p><p>Twenty-three-year-old Brynlee Daigle agrees. She's loved Madness Returns since begging her mom to buy it in 2012. Now, she discusses it with friends on Discord and does Alice roleplay on Tumblr. "One aspect of the game that still sticks with me is the important message about mental health, that no matter if you're disabled, or severely traumatized, you can overcome any obstacle in your way." </p><p>"It's why I have the [American McGee's Alice] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMm1M_JQUog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jabberwocky [boss] battle</u></a> tattooed on my thigh," she continues. "It's there to remind me I can always defeat my inner demons." </p><h2>A community lives on without its original creator</h2><p>Though he's helped Madness Returns sprout a loyal and hopeful community, McGee himself might prefer to let Alice's memory fade, like ink. In an email to IGN, a representative for McGee declined a request for comment, instead citing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFRZz8cAgfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recent YouTube video</u></a> as McGee's "final word on the matter" (after that, McGee acknowledged the "intensity of Alice<em> </em>fans" in relation to this article <a href="https://twitter.com/americanmcgee/status/1781074786472616365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on Twitter</u></a>). In the video, McGee describes being "emotionally, quite destroyed" after EA rejected his community-backed proposal for a third game.</p><p>Though McGee once welcomed fans' ardor while recruiting support for his Patreon, EA's rejection has understandably cut down his patience for it. He currently treats fans' eagerness like he would a slack-jawed Frankenstein – a creation that could never meet his wants and needs. </p><p>"Alice fans tend to have difficulty reading what I am saying when it comes to how much I DO NOT want to make games anymore," he wrote on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/americanmcgee/status/1783309103986852269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on April 24</u></a>. </p><p>Fans have learned to cope with his cold shoulder. Most of the meaning they derive from Madness Returns is personal anyway. </p><p>"Many of the active fans I've seen online are women," says Maria, "and American McGee's Alice goes through a lot as a young woman growing up in a world working against her." </p><p>"I think every woman can relate to some aspect of [Alice] in a way," she continues, "that feeling of something taken from them, that feeling of not seeming like you're in control [...] because you are a woman." So fans are grateful for what already exists. "If there's one thing I want people to take away from playing [Madness Returns]," says Jessilyn, "is that working through trauma — no matter how hard or stupid it is — can be worth it."</p><p>"If something is true, it’s true for all time," Brann says. "If the game resonates with people and helps them work through and leave behind some of their turmoil, understanding themselves more and what they’ve been through, that’s got to be a good thing."</p><p><em>Ashley Bardhan is a freelance writer at IGN</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In honor of the event, Humble is offering the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fsummer-games-done-quick-2024&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsummer-gdq-2024-humble-bundle-includes-an-homage-to-zelda-cd-i-a-great-3d-platformer-and-more%2F1100-6524602%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summer Games Done Quick Bundle</a>, with seven of the very games you can watch speedrunners demolish, offering a chance for you to play them as you watch and see just how much you need to continue to hone your skills.</p><p dir="ltr">As is usually the case with Humble, the SGDQ Bundle comes with a tiered pricing system that lets you pick your price and the games you want. For $12, the lowest tier, you get three games: stealth immersive sim Dishonored, Contra-like side-scroller Blazing Chrome, and non-Euclidian first-person shooter Hyperbolica. Bump the price up to $15, and Humble adds The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore. At $20, you get the full seven-game bundle, adding Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 and Penny's Big Breakaway.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble Bundles support charities as well as game developers, and you can pay more than the asking price to increase your donation. The SGDQ Bundle supports Doctors Without Borders, just like SGDQ does.</p><p dir="ltr">All the games in the bundle are well-regarded, but there are a couple of recently released standouts you might not have heard of. Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore is a side-scrolling Metroidvania that harkens back to the CD-ROM era--specifically to Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, the 1989 CD-i game that featured bad animation and worse voice acting. Arzette is playing with that same aesthetic to great effect, making it fast, fun, and funny in equal measure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also Penny's Big Breakaway, a 3D platformer drawing a lot from the aesthetic, vibe, and gameplay of 3D Sonic games--in fact, it was developed by Evening Star, a studio formed from the fan developers responsible for Sonic Mania. An extremely colorful art style compliments its fast and reactive approach to platforming.</p><p dir="ltr">Also notable in the SGDQ bundle are a couple of excellent Bethesda titles. Morrowind, of course, is the well-loved RPG that preceded The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and the now truly ubiquitous The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but Morrowind has a special place in the hearts of many fans. Dishonored, developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda, is also worthy of your attention if you've never gotten around to playing it, whether you love slipping through various levels unseen or slicing through your foes with a mess of creative paranormal powers.</p><h2>Humble Summer Games Done Quick Bundle</h2><p><strong>Pay at least $12</strong></p><ul><li>Blazing Chrome</li><li>Dishonored</li><li>Hyperbolica</li></ul><p><strong>Pay at least $15</strong></p><ul><li>Arzette</li><li>Blazing Chrome</li><li>Dishonored</li><li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li><li>Hyperbolica</li></ul><p><strong>Pay at least $20</strong></p><ul><li>Arzette</li><li>Blazing Chrome</li><li>Dishonored</li><li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li><li>Hyperbolica</li><li>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2</li><li>Penny's Big Breakaway</li></ul><hr><p dir="ltr">If you're in the mood for more Bethesda games, you've got additional options thanks to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15540845%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fgames&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsummer-gdq-2024-humble-bundle-includes-an-homage-to-zelda-cd-i-a-great-3d-platformer-and-more%2F1100-6524602%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical</a>'s <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsummer-gdq-2024-humble-bundle-includes-an-homage-to-zelda-cd-i-a-great-3d-platformer-and-more%2F1100-6524602%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</a>.

<p id="XGRn8D">Remember 2022’s <em>Prey</em>, the Predator prequel about a young warrior named Naru who faces off against an extraterrestrial headhunter? <em>Out of Darkness</em> is a lot like that, but instead of a Comanche woman living in the Great Plains circa 1719, it’s a Stone Age tribe of humans who wash ashore a strange land in search of food.

<p id="Hv77iu"><strong>Genre:</strong> Psychedelic action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 20m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Harmony Korine<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Jordi Mollà, Travis Scott, Joshua Tilley</p>
<p id="WqO7ba">What is there to say about <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, really? Filmed entirely in infrared photography, Harmony Korine’s latest experimental feature follows a melancholic assassin (Jordi Mollà) on a mission to murder a demonic, katana-wielding crime lord known as “The Beast” in nightmarish Floridian hellscape populated by eccentric gangsters and bikini-clad strippers. It’s a visually abrasive and unconventional film, but is it <em>actually</em> any good?</p>
<p id="jfbPox">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23916193/aggro-dr1ft-review-travis-scott-harmony-korine-incel-gamer-movie">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="udbdSc"><em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is an obtuse, ridiculous, headache-inducing movie to watch. It’s nearly impossible to tell whether any moment of the movie is entirely a joke or entirely sincere — it’s called <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, for God’s sake. It’s a meaningless phrase, rendered in all capital letters with a 1 standing in for an I; for all we know, it might as well be Travis Scott’s Gamertag. But the movie is more than that too. It’s as clear a depiction of a certain kind of distinctly male-coded interior life as I’ve ever seen, and there is value to making that in such a weirdly unfiltered way. <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> isn’t an enjoyable or particularly well-made movie, but it is the movie I’ve thought about most this year. For better or worse, that’s worth something. </p></blockquote>

<p id="1yh76C"><strong>Genre:</strong> Sci-fi action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 28m<br><strong>Director:</strong> George Miller<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke</p>
<p id="ugwDco"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23321917/george-miller-mad-max-three-thousand-years-of-longing">Mad Max director George Miller</a> has returned with another explosive entry in his post-apocalyptic action series. Set an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23984150/furiosa-mad-max-timeline-movie-continuity">indeterminate amount of years</a> before <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>, Anya Taylor-Joy (<em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>) stars as Furiosa, a young woman who struggles to reclaim her freedom after being kidnapped by Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), the ruthless leader of an army of bikers. Along the way, she’ll cross paths with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168903/furiosa-villain-immortan-joe-actor">Immortan Joe</a> (Lachy Hulme), her future boss turned adversary, and Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke), her mentor and ally.</p>
<p id="4D3Yei">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="vsq7PV">An epic, nearly 20-year saga likely isn’t what most people were expecting from <em>Furiosa</em>, but the approach allows the world to expand in pleasing ways. The MCU-ification of cinema means that franchise blockbusters often reveal characters, important MacGuffins, narrative loose ends, and potential sequel nods in bite-size teases that are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065485/mcu-post-credits-teases-sequels-rumors">less and less likely to lead anywhere</a>. But with <em>Furiosa</em>, Miller widens the scope of the Mad Max landscape exponentially, as characters old and new blast their way onto the screen, giving clearer insight into the setting of the Wasteland, its societal hierarchies, its gasoline-fueled wars, and its steampunk-hued reality.</p></blockquote>

<p id="5kPezr"><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 4m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Hayao Miyazaki<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Soma Santoki, Masaki Suda, Aimyon</p>
<p id="njTgWv">After more than a decade, Hayao Miyazaki has returned with a new fantasy follow-up to his 2013 historical drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/30/21275291/the-wind-rises-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-hbo-max"><em>The Wind Rises</em></a><em>. </em>Inspired by Miyazaki’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22732913/how-do-you-live-excerpt-hayao-miyazaki-favorite-novel">favorite childhood novel</a>, as well as his own experiences growing up in post-WWII Japan, <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> follows Mahito, a young boy who loses his mother in a tragic fire. After moving to the countryside with his newly remarried father, Mahito crosses paths with a mysterious anthropomorphic bird that entices him with the promise of being reunited with his mother.</p>
<p id="NEdXef">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="xfjuDz">On the surface, all of this is par for the course for a Miyazaki film, with trace elements from <em>Spirited Away,</em> <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>,<em> </em>or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/26/21270987/kikis-delivery-service-best-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki"><em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em></a><em>.</em> The confusion starts when viewers try to square that with the parakeets, causality-breaking out-of-time characters, and the heron turning out to be a small gnomelike man wearing a living bird like a suit. Could all those elements be purposeful trolling from a director known for his, to put it delicately, acerbic personality? Maybe, but there seems to be a statement behind the madness: It’s as if Miyazaki is declaring, “This is my life’s work. I don’t care if you’ve enjoyed it. Goodbye.”</p></blockquote>

<p id="kp0pkB"><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 42m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Ishana Night Shyamalan<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dakota Fanning, Georgina Campbell, Olwen Fouéré</p>
<p id="cDU3aq">Dakota Fanning stars in <em>The Watchers</em>, the debut horror feature from Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23589900/m-night-shyamalan-movie-cameos-explained-haha">M. Night Shyamalan</a>. The film follows Mina, an American immigrant living in western Ireland who is tasked with delivering a parrot to a zoo in Belfast. After losing her way in a vast forest, Mina finds shelter in a strange bunker alongside three other strangers who are being held captive by strange malicious entities who observe them through a mirrored window. </p>
<p id="ZCehL3">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24173290/the-watchers-review-ishana-night-shyamalan-dakota-fanning">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="UPPZTb">Most of <em>The Watchers</em>’ appeal comes from all the mysteries in this setup: wondering what the Watchers are and what they want, what secrets the other three captives are hiding, who will inevitably crack first under the pressure the eerie situation puts the group under, and how Mina’s arrival will upset the status quo. The sharp, high-contrast cinematography (from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22724430/lamb-movie-sheep-birth-scenes"><em>Lamb</em></a>’s Eli Arenson) gives these opening chapters a winningly oppressive look, with the golden glow of the Coop extending out into the deep blues and blacks of the nighttime woods. The constant effect of the Coop’s mirrored wall gives the characters an eerie set of duplicates hovering nearby at all times, which Shyamalan and Arenson use to create a hyper-real but still fable-like atmosphere that’s often haunting and unsettling.</p></blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-descendant-review-in-progress.914928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At this point, I’ve now played The First Descendant in three or four different beta iterations, and each time I’ve felt no more or less certain whether this would be something my friends and I would want to play, or just another sci-fi shooter in a sea of similar games vying for our attention. After more than 45 hours sunk into a pre-launch preview build over the past week, I’m only slightly closer to answering that question – but I’m certainly not having a bad time. I’ve got a whole lot left to play, including the all-important endgame, for instance, so as of now I’m still not sure if The First Descendant will be my next looter-shooter fixation, or yet another one that misses the mark.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>Nexon’s free-to-play third-person multiplayer game plays in the same space as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review"><u>Genshin Impact</u></a>, complete with cool-looking characters to unlock and countless currencies and materials to grind, all of which can be bypassed by those simply willing to cough up their hard-earned cash. And, like some of its polished contemporaries, there’s a pretty decent game here in spite of a UI that requires a PhD in RPG hogwash to decipher and an irritating monetization model that does crazy things like make you pay real money to increase your inventory capacity or get RNG consumable dye packets just to change the color of your gear. Running around with friends while shooting enemies and unleashing interesting supernatural abilities upon alien armies is an undeniably good time (as it is in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/20/warframe-review-3">Warframe</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outriders-review">Outriders</a>, to name a few) and the deep RPG mechanics and loot systems are a spreadsheet-loving nerd’s dream. It’s also a fairly pretty game that feels a lot more premium than one might expect from the free-to-play space, despite the occasional framerate dip or crash (at least in its pre-release state). That said, the free-to-play model is every bit as eyebrow raising as it might sound, the story and dialogue is laughably bad, and much of the campaign is packed with filler that can be a real snooze.</p><p>I’ve split my dozens of hours dashing around small hub areas completing repetitive chores in between much more substantial missions and boss battles against robotic kaiju called colossuses. Those self-contained missions and boss fights are exactly the kind of thing I hope for in an action-packed cooperative game: Some seriously awesome combat that rivals its peers, interesting enemies to take down, and a loot system that had me regularly trying out the latest shiny weapon I pulled from some shmuck’s corpse. If The First Descendant would just let me mainline that part, we’d be onto something and my mind would be made up. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The impressive self-contained missions are kept locked behind dull errands.</p></div><p>Unfortunately, so much of it is kept locked behind sections where you complete a series of really dull errands, like defending a piece of tech from waves of enemy assaults, gathering items from fallen baddies to deposit into a collection robot, or just killing stuff until a miniboss spawns for you to take out. Not even dope combat can stave off boredom when it has you hanging around for a few minutes while you wait for small groups of enemies to spawn until you’re told that you succeeded, then being directed to the next spot on the map to do it again. These sections account for a pretty big chunk of what you do during the main story, too, seemingly to pad out the adventure so you don’t burn through the more interesting activities too quickly. Worst of all, there are only a few flavors of these kinds of quests, so you’ll find yourself being asked to repeat them multiple times in between every boss battle or more meaty story mission.</p><p>While I’ve only played through half of the campaign, so far it’s really not looking great, fam. Absolutely brimming with nonsensical sci-fi babble like “dimensional walls,” “inverted data codes,” and “unleashing Arche,” it’s one of the sillier stories I’ve seen in a while. Most of the dialogue is absolutely atrocious: At one point I burst out laughing when a bad guy menacingly declared, “Qliphoth will engulf Ingris. The roars of the Vulgus will fill this land with fear!” In another section I shook my head as an antagonistic character named Jeremy (a grown man with the voice of a whiney, spoiled teenage brat), showed up to be the most annoying person in the world and was mean to me for no reason while I ran quests for him. It’s truly heinous stuff, but some of it is so bad it’s pretty amusing – I eventually found myself looking forward to cutscenes, eager for the next hit of sci-fi gibberish and butchered voice performances. (On top of the absurdity, the English voices rarely come close to matching the lips of the characters speaking. That’s fine if you enjoy watching anime dubs, but I find it pretty distracting.)</p><p>Thankfully, the most interesting characters are those you can unlock and play as, like the unflappable electric speedster Bunny (my personal favorite), or the sarcastic and smarmy grenade-chucking soldier Lepic. Some of the cast do still seem a bit shallow, largely because you get only a little backstory and character development for most of them, but hearing them cheer as you blast monsters to bits and seeing their charming animations – which clearly had much more effort put into them than those of the NPCs – is quite nice. Only one of these playable characters has an actual questline associated with them (with more planned for the future), but the bits of that story I played were some of the better content available in The First Descendant at launch, so here’s hoping they at least deliver on that front.</p><p>Actually learning to play as them is great too, although I still have plenty more characters to unlock before I’m able to take them all for a spin. One character might control the battlefield with explosive AoE attacks, while another covers enemies in devastating ice-based debuffs. Bunny does insane DPS by running around as much as possible to generate electrical energy, then unleashes it in powerful blasts. Since each of the characters has their own style of play, switching between them offers a markedly different experience, like how Ajax, a heavy tank with protective abilities is all about standing your ground instead. Most games with playable characters as its main chase live or die by how compelling those unlockable avatars are, and so far The First Descendent seems like it’s loaded with distinctive options that are absolutely worth going through the trouble to obtain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Similarly, the weapons, equipment, and upgrades you earn while shotgunning your way through levels are awesome. Loot drops constantly, most weapons feel distinct and satisfying to play with, and watching the numbers go up as you modify and upgrade every new toy in your arsenal makes The First Descendant hard to put down… until it forces you into about 15 separate menus to juggle dozens of materials and so many different systems that you might want to keep your inhaler at the ready. This kind of thing is pretty typical for looter-shooters, granted, but even by the already gag-inducing standards of the genre, this one’s especially obnoxious to learn – especially since the tutorial robot who shows you the ropes in the social area explains things to you in a series of texts that pass by quickly enough to challenge your speed-reading skills.</p><p>Even after spending dozens of hours with this pre-launch preview build, I’ve got plenty more to play and an endgame to dive into once it launches properly next week. Check back in the coming weeks for my final, scored review. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-exs-randomizer-mod-now-lets-you-pet-the-dogs-and-cats<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>It's said that every time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> is mentioned, someone reinstalls it. If that's true and you read RPS, it's possible you've reinstalled Deus Ex around six hundred times by now. 
</p>
<p>That's where the comprehensive Randomizer mod comes in, which remixes the immersive sim's levels to make the experience fresh every time. It's also just received a major update which, among several other additions, lets you pet the game's dogs and cats. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm long over the 'can you pet the dog'-ification of video games, but this is a good excuse to mention the Randomizer mod. Here's the trailer for this new version:
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Deus Ex Randomizer v3.0 Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3mTcG6xeq4?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Deus Ex Randomizer v3.0 Trailer</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3mTcG6xeq4?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V3mTcG6xeq4?autoplay=1">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3mTcG6xeq4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>It lets you randomise almost every interactive element in a Deus Ex level, from enemies to passwords, repair bots to starting locations, weapon stats to augmentations. All of these randomisations are tweakable by the player, and can take into account other settings like the selected difficulty.
</p>
<p>You might wonder what petting animals has to do with randomisation. The Randomizer mod also contains several quality-of-life improvements to the base game, including auto-fill for passwords you've discovered, an aug selection wheel, and a speedrun mode. Several of these improvements, by reducing the need for a keyboard, make the game much nicer to play on Steam Deck.
</p>
<p>You can head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases/tag/v3.0.0">Deus Ex Randomizer page on Github</a> for a full set of patch notes. That's also where you'll find download links to the mod, including an installer that makes it straightforward to setup even if you're new to using Deus Ex mods.</p>

Meanwhile, <strong>Hoa</strong> is a gorgeous family-friendly platformer that's well-worth checking out.</p><p>Most of these games are Steam Deck-compatible as well, so you can install them and let your kids enjoy them while they're parked on the couch next to you.</p><p>If you have a Nintendo Switch, the upcoming slate of family-friendly Switch games are now available to preorder: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524359/" data-ref-id="1100-6524359">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524356/" data-ref-id="1100-6524356">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524388/" data-ref-id="1100-6524388">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524363/" data-ref-id="1100-6524363">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
After a long (and in my case, slightly impatient) wait, Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse - the third and regrettably final season of Telltale Games' episodic point-and-click adventure series - will be getting the remaster treatment on 14th August this year.
</p>
<p>
Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse originally released back in 2010, wrapping up Telltales' Sam &amp; Max adventures in style, following the release of 2006's Sam &amp; Max: Save the World and 2007's Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space.
</p>
<p>
For their third and final Telltale outing, the irrepressible crime-fighting dog and bunny duo - originally created by cult comic book artist Steve Purcell - faced down Eldritch gods, alien warlords, and more in a battle to control an ancient, otherworldly power.

<p>
As for this year's Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sam-max-the-devils-playhouse-remastered-is-coming-in-2023">originally due in 2023</a> before getting a bit of a delay), it's once again being handled by developer Skunkape Games - which acquired the rights to Telltale's Sam &amp; Max adventures in 2018 after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-year-at-telltale-a-story-cut-short">studio shut its doors</a>, with many of the team having worked on the original games back in the day.
</p>
<p>
"When Max stumbles upon a mysterious toy that allows him to glimpse the future," explains the official blurb, "the Freelance Police unwittingly arouse the attention of a host of villains hellbent on acquiring the magical Toys of Power. To prevent the Devil's Toybox from falling into the wrong hands, Sam &amp; Max must face their most frightening adversary yet: the power of Max’s mind."
</p>
<p>
Skunkape hasn't shared much in the way of specifics about its remastering work for The Devil's Playhouse, but it seems reasonable to assume it'll include most of the improvements seen in the studio's lovingly handled remasters of Save the World and Beyond Time and Space.
</p>
<p>
Expect the likes of enhanced graphics and audio, dynamic lighting, improved lip syncing, revised character models more in keeping with Steve Purcell's original designs, new acting and camerawork, new music from original composer Jared Emerson-Johnson, a new user interface, controller support, and more.
</p>
<p>
Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered will be available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2648050/Sam__Max_The_Devils_Playhouse/">Steam</a> and GOG) when it launches on 14th August. And if you wouldn't mind making a brand-new Sam &amp; Max game next Skunkape, that'd be grand.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-4-cheats-codes">The Sims 4</a> is continuing its efforts to represent all the worst parts of modern living. The last expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4-will-finally-let-you-be-a-predatory-landlord-or-a-tenant-dying-from-mould">added predatory landlords and mould-soaked apartments</a>. The next expansion will add the ability to create dating app profiles for your sims. It's called Lovestruck and it'll launch on July 25th.

<p>Lovestruck adds the Cupid's Corner app, on which players can create a profile for their sim, define what sort of partner they're looking for, then choose what kind of date to go on. How successful the date is will be determined by the sims' Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, which set out the kinds of interests and interactions they're looking for in a potential romantic partner.
</p>
<p>Those dates can take place in a new city, which has three districts designed with romance in mind. There's also a new career path, "Romance Consultant", which I'm assuming is like the movie Hitch and not anything more euphimistic. Although there is also a new "Romantic Blanket" which sims can apparently take with them if they decide they want to woohoo outdoors, so who knows.
</p>
<p>As an expansion pack, Lovestruck adds both new systems, like new ways to date and new relationship metrics, and new outfits and items with which to decorate your home. They're the biggest of The Sims' various flavours of DLC - more substantial than Game Packs, and with new systems unlike Stuff Packs or Kits - and the size is reflected in the price, which is £35/$40.
</p>
<p>If that's not too high a price for love, the expansion launches on July 25th.</p>

<p id="xDDAHx">Scattered around the Land of Shadow of the DLC, you’ll run into six of Moore’s Forager Brood friends — non-hostile Lesser Kindreds of Rot. If you speak with them, they’ll each give you a <strong>Forager Brood Cookbook</strong>. You can pick up the Forager Brood Cookbooks 1 through 4 and also 7 before you take on Shadow Keep.</p>


<p id="uMtEMO">One of these Pests — the one on the north side of the Church of the Crusade — will be in bad shape when you find them. Use a <strong>Warming Stone</strong> to heal them, travel back to the Highroad Cross Site of Grace, and then return again to get the cookbook.</p>
<p id="HassG1">Once you heal that Forager and pick up the Forager Brood Cookbook (4) from them, head back to Moore and he’ll give you Forager Brood Cookbook (7). <strong>You have to do this before breaking Miquella’s charm at Shadow Keep</strong>.</p>

<p id="8Gwctn">Moore, as you may have noticed, is quite fond of the Forager Brood. If you kill any of them that you’ve met — after getting the cookbook from them, of course — Moore will invade and attack you. (The trigger for this seems a little fickle, so it may actually take killing two of them to trigger the invasion.)</p>
<p id="lnJ0ta">Defeating him will get you his <strong>Verdigris Greatshield </strong>and <strong>Verdigris armor set</strong>.</p>
<p id="EDfQaP">When you do this, it will kill off Moore and he will disappear from your game. Back at Main Gate Cross, all you’ll find is <strong>Moore’s Bell Bearing</strong>.</p>

<p id="S0YDGR">You can continue up to the <strong>Shadow Keep Main Gate Site of Grace</strong>, but <em>don’t</em> start the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182448/golden-hippopotamus-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat-sote-dlc"><strong>Golden Hippopotamus</strong></a> boss fight yet — especially if you want to progress <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24183407/hornsent-questline-summon-or-leda-sote">Hornsent</a>’s questline.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review.914889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Growing up in the suburbs of Illinois, I remember bringing my dad to and from the train station to get to work in the big city of Chicago. When Ticket to Ride came out later in life, it brought a lot of nostalgia for those big-city dreams in one of my other favorite memories with my family: playing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. </p><div id="202549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride: Paris</h3></p><div><p>Experience the glamour of 1920s Paris in this fast-paced Ticket to Ride edition, racing to visit iconic locations.</p></div></div><p>Family board game nights involving the franchise can bring you places worldwide, and also to different time periods. That's the case with the newest edition, Ticket to Ride: Paris, brings you to the bustling metropolis of Paris, France, in the Roaring Twenties. </p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-1-1719602183470.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The compact box of Ticket to Ride Paris holds a small treasure trove of gaming pieces. It includes a guidebook introducing a new game element, a small board, four bags of colored bus tokens (with an additional spare bag), matching circle colored meeples, destination tickets, and transportation cards adorned with art that evokes the spirit of the Roaring Twenties. The box's thoughtful design, with a plastic compartment for each piece, ensures easy cleanup after the game. </p><p>The board is also small. I could probably fit it in a medium-sized purse or bag if I wanted to. The top possible score on the perimeter of the border is only 50. The city routes are divided by color and are relatively short as well. The eight longest routes are three lengths. There are twelve double routes and twelve single routes. Most of the routes are double routes, with only a handful of exceptions. There are four single three-car routes, two single double-car routes, and only one single-car solo route. </p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-2-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Ticket to Ride: Paris is a very beginner-friendly map. I brought this, along with a copy of a junior version (<a href="https://zdcs.link/8B0R7" target="_blank"><u>Ticket to Ride: Ghost Train</u></a>), to a local brewery to play with four friends this weekend. Half of the group wasn’t familiar with the franchise. Half were familiar as we regularly play base game versions digitally in my digital board game community. (Jimmy, it’s your turn over there, by the way.) This version of the game didn’t add as many complexities as other maps, so it made the game quite easy to navigate for everyone there. I was excited about introducing the series to friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ticket to Ride: Paris is a very beginner-friendly map.</p></div><p>You can play Ticket to Ride: Paris with two to four players. In a two-player game, I would guesstimate that the game might be more competitive since the game changes slightly with a two-player game versus more. Four was the maximum number of players, so we could see a complete view of how it played with its max capacities solely on its own—especially as I didn’t bring a full version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/1v275" target="_blank"><u>Ticket to Ride</u></a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/JdNON" target="_blank"><u>Ticket to Ride Europe</u></a> with me. (You are recommended to play maps normally with one of those base games.)</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-3-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Several mechanics in the original base games are akin to how others in the franchise operate. Choose your color to play and place your associated meeple on the start zero space on the board's perimeter. Grab the associated buses to go with your color for later placement on the board. </p><p>Next, you’ll distribute each player two face-down secret destination cards from a deck.  Players can choose to take both but must take one of them. After you’ve got your destinations, players will take turns collecting transportation cards to get buses to place along the board on their route. You can only claim one route per turn, so you must think stragetically and choose wisely.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-4-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You can place routes on any tracks in games with more than two players, even if they are double routes. You cannot claim both routes of a double track, though.</p><p>You have a limited number of buses, so you’ll want to be mindful of your destinations and the number of trains you and your opponents have. The game ends when someone runs out of placeable buses. </p><h2>Build a French Flag for More Points</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/ticket-to-ride-paris-5-1719602183471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One great addition to Ticket to Ride: Paris is that, as you place your buses, you can create French flags to gain points. French flags are created by making routes with red, white, and blue sets of collected transportation cards. You can only work on one flag at a time. When you complete a colored route with one of the colors in the flag, you’ll be able to keep one of the cards used to work on building a French flag. Completing a flag can only be done with those tricolors, however. Unlike routes, you cannot complete a flag with a rainbow bus. After you complete a flag, you discard those cards and can start on a new one. You’ll gain an additional four points for each completed flag, so you’ll want to use those three colors as a part of your strategy as well.</p><p>One of the magical things about playing games like this is that it inspires folks to discuss travel and transportation. The colored transportation cards each have different forms of transportation from the Twenties, including a trolly, a steamboat, a fancy car, a bicycle, and a croissant truck. It inspired conversations about how diverse travel can be in places worldwide–especially in one focused city. One friend told me how she had taken a day trip to Paris from London by bus. She told us about her thoughts traveling through and seeing some of the sights that were destinations on our board. Sadly, I have not made my way to Paris yet, but now, thanks to the game, I feel a bit of a connection to another part of the world and am inspired to visit new destinations if I ever go there.</p><h2>Where to Buy It</h2><p>Ticket to Ride Paris is available for an accessible price. You can buy it for only $24.99 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/yL84e" target="_blank">Asmodee’s store</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/lVvNO" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

But before you make purchases on Steam, we'd recommend checking to see if Green Man Gaming or Fanatical has the deal for a better price. <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-8000-pc-games-discounted-in-new-fanatical-sale-that-also-includes-freebies/1100-6524318/" data-ref-id="1100-6524318">Fanatical's Red Hot Sale</a></strong> includes over 8,000 game deals, the majority of which are delivered as Steam keys. GMG's sale also includes a significant number of Steam games. Both Fanatical and GMG have better prices on some games--so it's definitely worth comparing first.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>'s received its first major update in yonks last year, and then the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-2023-and-team-fortress-2-just-set-a-new-all-time-player-record">nearly 17-year-old game promptly broke its concurrent player record</a>. Still, talk to one of those players and you'll find all is not well with Valve's shooter, which is apparently regularly overrun by bots and cheaters.
</p>
<p>Some players are now reporting "a large ban wave" targeting users of aimbots, however.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve themselves have not announced that they've taken any new action, so all we have to go on are reports from the community. 
</p>
<p>One user posted an image of a message they allegedly received from Steam Support. "Our team noticed your accounts were involved in majorly disruptive activity in Team Fortress 2. Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated, and accounts used for other purposes have been locked and banned," says the message.
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>valve are now banning tf2 bot hosters and sending this message directly to them, stating "Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated"</p><p>VALVE PLEASE KEEP DOING THIS DON'T STOP <a href="https://t.co/PQ9SRZnB60">pic.twitter.com/PQ9SRZnB60</a></p></div>— heavy team fortres 2 (@heavyfortres) <a href="https://twitter.com/heavyfortres/status/1806418629581476180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Another community member claimed to have confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/WeezyTF2/status/1806282466077901226">a "prominent hoster" of bots had been banned. There's much anecdotal evidence that the game has fewer bots in online matches than normal.
</a></p>
<p>Some players also pointed to substantial and sudden dips in Team Fortress 2's player count as evidence of banwaves. At the time of writing, however, the game has had <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/440#1m">a steady and significant increase in its player count</a>.</p>
<p>Players have been begging Valve to take action to clean up Team Fortress 2 for years, often organising under the #SaveTF2 moniker. This isn't the first ban-wave in recent years either, although previous efforts have seemed short-lived, with cheaters swiftly moving back in. For the sake of those still playing, I hope this time is different.</p>

<article id="post-6484">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>As the world’s biggest <em>Alan Wake 2</em> Fan (a title I awarded to myself), I was excited to learn that a physical collector’s edition would be made available months after launch. My enthusiasm died off, however, when I looked at the package. <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/alan-wake-ii-collectors-edition/products/alan-wake-2-collectors-edition-ps5">For $200 at Limited Run Games</a>, you can get a physical copy of the game —&nbsp; the only place where you can do so — along with a copy of <em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, an angel lamp replica, an art book, a keychain, and some digital cosmetics. It’s alright as far as collector’s editions go, but the kicker was that I had already bought the deluxe edition at launch, which included around half of what comes in the box. And there was no way to upgrade. I’d have to spend $200 <em>on top</em> of the $80 I already paid. Even beyond the fun collectibles, that’s basically $300 just for a physical copy, to own the game outright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking around, I can see similar frustration bubbling across a lot of the video game industry, and it’s reaching a boiling point. As games become more expensive to produce and are therefore becoming more costly to buy, players are lashing out at studios who want to get them to spend more for increasingly diminishing returns, whether through microtransactions or premium editions that offer “free” extras. While many might be worth it, some, like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s collectors edition, don’t offer enough for the exorbitant cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everything is very expensive right now. I’m not spending hundreds of dollars on stuff I already own or digital products that aren’t important or useful. And I know I’m not alone in this, either. Something has to change in the video games industry, and looking at special editions becoming increasingly sketchy is an area I think is being overlooked.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While games are more expensive than ever, with $70 being standard for many AAA games these days, the situation could be way worse. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-games-really-more-expensive">Analysts</a> <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2023/02/10/why-more-new-video-games-now-cost-70/">generally</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/7/21314545/console-video-game-price-increase-70-video-game-ps5-xbox-series-x">agree</a> that based on inflation and rising development costs, games should cost even more than they do now. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-03/ex-playstation-chief-mulls-future-of-gaming-and-his-new-job?srnd=technology-vp">Former Sony Interactive CEO Shawn Layden told Bloomberg</a> in 2021 that many PlayStation 4 games were topping $100 million, and he expected that number to only get higher. At the time, he said $200 million, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233">according to a presentation in the recent Insomniac Games leak</a>, the budget for the PS5’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> was around $300 million. And while the game sold very well, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ps5-hardware-sales-hit-quarterly-high-but-that-isn-t-good-enough-for-sony">Sony said in its February financials</a> that it was bolstered by its sales of third-party games, not hardware or in-house development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of these costs have been offset over the years by purchases made outside of just buying the base game: microtransactions, gacha mechanics, paid DLC, games-as-a-service (GaaS), and premium collector’s editions. As scummy as many of these tactics can be, they do what they’re supposed to do. Live-service games like <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite </em>do well because players continue to invest in them over time. Regardless of whether you need a <em>Fortnite</em> skin that makes you look like a member of Metallica or not, these companies have become experts at getting you to buy things, which in turn has contributed to keeping full game prices low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A premium edition has microtransactions built in — “for free,” in a way. Usually, you’ll see a cosmetic pack or a season pass for post-launch DLC in an $80 deluxe edition. Sometimes the studio will put up a limited-time collector’s edition for a couple hundred bucks for the big spenders who want a unique piece of merch or an artbook. The <em>Alan Wake 2</em> deluxe edition, for instance, came with two costumes, a weapon skin, an extra charm for protagonist Saga, and the story DLC expansion pass for an extra $20. While the majority of people will simply buy the standard edition, many will still pay extra for one of these special versions. The deluxe edition here was worth it to me just for the expansion pass. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pay-more-to-play-why-video-game-prices-could-rise-in-2023">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine put it</a>, “many games are already much more expensive than $70, and people happily pay for them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately for studios, as games get more expensive and other factors contribute to higher costs everywhere else, people are becoming wary of premium editions and extra purchases. When the standard edition of a AAA game can cost $70, a higher price tag has to be worth it. They can’t be <em>too</em> expensive, and if they are, the stuff included needs to ensure you that your wallet won’t start crying. You also can’t lock critical features behind paywalls. The same standards for microtransactions apply here as well; if you offer, say, a weapon that gives players a huge advantage, you’re saying you only care about money, not about the players themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While most developers and publishers these days are better about not offering pay-to-win items (or at least are better at hiding it), that hasn’t stopped them from breaking cardinal rules. Recently <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> developer Battlestate Games announced its The Unheard Edition. For $250, players got access to a highly sought-after offline PvE mode and features that gave them a huge advantage at the beginning of seasons. This was especially frustrating for players who purchased other premium editions with a season pass that promised to provide access to all future DLC. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140541/escape-from-tarkov-the-unheard-edition-250">Battlestate initially refused</a> to offer an upgrade discount or any other avenue for players to get PvE, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/05/23/all-escape-from-tarkov-eod-owners-now-have-access-to-250-pve-mode/">although it eventually relented</a> after immense community backlash.</p>



<p>Big studios have been trying out other ideas, with features that are appealing but fleeting. A recent trend has been including early access periods in special edition pre-orders. Although, even that might not be enough anymore when a game like <em>Concord</em> is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/">offering a brief beta period</a> for pre-order owners before launching an open beta the next week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft hasn’t done anything as openly egregious, but it’s made a habit of giving special edition owners exclusive missions. Its upcoming open-world RPG <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is now up for pre-order, and people who buy the Gold or Ultimate editions get access to a season pass that features an exclusive Jabba the Hutt mission. The publisher has gotten around more widespread criticism with this strategy by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-spend-115-on-star-wars-outlaws-ultimate-edition">offering missions up later through Ubisoft Connect</a> with easy-to-obtain in-game currency, and in the case of <em>Star Wars</em>, players will still get to interact with the big slug boy in the main game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, just because games companies offer up decent extras doesn’t mean players will react accordingly. When <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> released on Steam, people noticed that the store page featured some extra purchases, which you could buy either in the “A Boon For New Adventurers – New Journey Pack,” as a part of the deluxe edition, or piecemeal. While people went to leave negative reviews on the page to complain about it, all of the items — rare as some of them were —&nbsp; could be found or earned in game. So on paper, Capcom was acting fairly. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108587/dragons-dogma-2-microtransactions-dlc-steam-reviews">Oli Welsh wrote for Polygon</a> that a lot of the backlash was due to the restrictive nature of <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2’</em>s game design (you could buy a Portcrystal to initiative fast travel, which is highly discouraged in-game, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, people were so quick to jump on Capcom for alleged exploitation in this case, and it’s mostly unfounded. You don’t <em>have</em> to get any of the items and you can earn all of them by just playing the game. But you can just tell from how quickly people reacted to this and other recent editions: They’re tired of being taken advantage of.</p>



<p>But to keep making profit (among other things like having to appeal to investors who want consistent growth every year and going into debt through constant, ridiculous acquisitions), studios will keep using the strategies that work. Microtransactions and collector’s editions aren’t going anywhere while they still bring in that much cash. If we must continue down this path, companies need to make purchases fair, listen to feedback, and understand that many just can’t afford digital nonsense. Players don’t need to experience opening their <em>Fallout 76</em> special edition only to find out the canvas bag was actually made of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/fallout-76-power-armor-edition-canvas-bag-swapped-with-nylon-bag/">cheaper, shittier nylon</a> or that the DLC they were promised might not apply to them. And if I’m going to be surrounded by little tchotchkes from my favorite games, I better not regret paying $200.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Streamer and influencer Guy 'DrDisrespect' Beahm continues to lose partners and support in the wake of allegations concerning his ban from Twitch, with YouTube now preventing him from earning money via his channel.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-youtube-sexting-allegation-minor-1851565750">Kotaku</a>, a YouTube spokesperson said the platform has "suspended monetisation on DrDisrespect's channel for violating our Creator Responsibility policy."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that this channel, which has 4.7 million subscribers, has also been removed from the YouTube Partner Program "following serious allegations against the creator."</p>
<p>This will apply not only to Beahm's existing channels,but any he creates in the future.</p>
<p>The allegations emerged last Friday, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a> reported a former member of Twitch's trust and safety team claimed Beahm was banned from that site after sending inappropriate messages to a minor and attempting to arrange to meet them at TwitchCon.</p>
<p>In the wake of the report, Beahm claimed the matter had already been resolved and that "no wrongdoing was acknowledged." After <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">Twitch banned permanently banned him in 2020</a>, he sued the site and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">the case was settled in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, game developer Midnight Society – which Beahm co-founded – announced it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/midnight-society-parts-ways-with-co-founder-dr-disrespect">parted ways with the streamer</a>, while peripherals firm Turtle Beach dropped its partnership with Beahm.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last night, Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff – an associate of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm</a> who’s recently done a spectacular job of digging his own grave – got <a href="https://x.com/StreamerBans/status/1806584079996899816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended from Twitch</a>. Following months of sustained anti-trans rhetoric that ramped up in recent weeks, the bro-y streamer is finally facing tangible consequences after dropping the T-slur during a stream. On the upside, it seems like he's learned his lesson and plans to turn over a new leaf.&nbsp;</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>“Banned for using the word ‘Tranny’ on Twitch,” Kolcheff, who has over 6 million followers on Twitch, <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1806640207216664777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “Apparently that’s a derogatory term. That’s on me. Next time I’ll use ‘mental health disorder.’”</p><p>This raises a lot of questions about the usefulness of Twitch’s rules in a situation like this. These rules <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#11HatefulConduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explicitly forbid</a>, among other things, “expressions of contempt, hatred, or disgust based on a protected characteristic” including “statements that a protected group should not exist.” During a recent stream, Kolcheff literally said that trans people <em>do </em>not exist: “There’s no such thing as trans people,” <a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1800327448879612330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a> while playing <em>Elden Ring</em>. “That’s something that you created. So have fun with your little dream land, but that shit is not even real.”&nbsp;</p><p>Other incidents have included a 2023 Pride Month invocation of “leave little children alone” rhetoric in response to transgender rights protesters in Florida – which ultimately led Activision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755282/call-of-duty-nickmercs-homophobic-comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yank his in-game skin from <em>Call of Duty</em></a> – and a recent dust-up with Ava Kris Tyson, a close friend of Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson who is trans. Tyson was criticizing defenders of Dr Disrespect, which prompted Kolcheff to <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1804626242194362502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reply</a>: "You should be ashamed of yourself. Leaving behind your wife &amp; child, to play pretend. One day you’ll wake up and realize what you’ve done."</p><p>These are just a few examples of a clear pattern of behavior on Kolcheff’s part, one that stretches back an entire year and demonstrably demonizes a marginalized group. But Twitch only opted to ban him after he used a slur, at which point he responded by immediately giving up the game: Cruel language is just the tip of the iceberg, and the substance behind it is the actual point. Kolcheff wants people to know that he believes trans people are delusional – that a desire to embody a different gender is a disorder, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/19/health/is-gender-dysphoria-mental-disorder-treatment-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is factually untrue</a>, by the way – and he’ll keep saying it until he’s blue in the face. The kinds of ideas he’s propagating are much more harmful than an admittedly shitty term; they are what convince people to fear, loathe, and even <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-religion-arrests-riots-race-and-ethnicity-c65c1090ed923687716114be371e9fdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do violence</a> to trans folks. On and around Twitch, the damage has already been done, and it sure seems like Kolcheff plans to do more.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when Kolcheff returns from <a href="https://x.com/CommanderRoot/status/1806596115921240208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what appears to be a temporary suspension</a>? It seems unlikely that Twitch will suddenly start taking action against things Kolcheff has been saying for a year. Meanwhile, he’ll need to be a little savvier about how he says them – he’ll just have to tiptoe around the gargantuan, unmissable minefield that is using a slur – and that’ll be that. That in mind, who is this ban serving? Who benefits from it? Unless Twitch decides to actually enforce its rules when it comes to transphobic dog whistles, plausible deniability be damned, it may as well not be doing anything at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This set isn't one mentioned in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-2024-roadmap-stars-fallout-modern-horizons-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 roadmap</a>, nor is it another Universes Beyond crossover with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Assassins Creed</em></a>. <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> is designed for players of all skill levels, and as a starting point for newcomers.</p>
<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundation</em>s announcement</h2>
<p>Wizards of the Coast recently held a preview panel at MagicCon: Amsterdam. That panel, now available in its entirety on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is_ghoPFjrw">YouTube channel</a>, revealed what <em>Magic</em> fans could expect going into the second half of 2024. It opened discussing <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> alongside sneak peeks at the upcoming <em>Bloomburrow</em> and <em>Duskmorn</em> sets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-anthem-of-champions-artwork.jpg?itok=HjynPzvz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-anthem-of-champions-artwork.jpg?itok=DigR3_CV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to teach someone what an anthem effect is? Here it is.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the panel, <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> is a new Standard-legal set. As the name implies, it is meant to establish a foundation for the new era of the popular card game and help new players get into the hobby. If you have never played <em>Magic</em> before, this set is designed to show why fans love it so much.</p>
<p>The set will contain reprints of fan-favorite cards across the game's history. In addition, the set will contain brand new cards; essentially a 50/50 split of new and old.</p>
<p>The panel briefly showed new card art. It confirmed the return of older cards like <em>Llanowar Elves</em>,<em> Day of Judgment</em>, and <em>Omniscience</em>. They also revealed new cards such as <em>Anthem of Champions</em>, an aptly named Green/White anthem Enchantment, and <em>Nine-Lives Familiar</em>, a literal cat with nine lives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=BdGDP6vp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=etmnDJx8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fans, enjoy hunting these down.</figcaption></figure><p>The card artwork in <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> showcases a focus on accessibility and approachability. Cards in this set will contain succinct text and straightforward effects. Furthermore,&nbsp; Enchantment cards going forward will feature Nyx borders. This means Enchantment and Artifact cards will have their own frame, making them more readable.</p>
<p>Naturally, <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will contain alternate versions of these cards. The panel confirms extended art variants and borderless variants of both the reprints and new cards. The panel even teases the return of certain legendary creatures and Planeswalkers, one even alludes to fan-favorite Chandra Nalaar.</p>
<p><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will be released November 15.</p>

            <p>
It's funny to think about names. If circumstances were just a tiny bit different, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkUVRGCidjE">Chuck Spadina</a> could have been up on stage winning over E3 by telling it how breathtaking it is; we might have all have been round the arcade <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-could-have-been-called-kong-dong-nintendo-court-documents-state">giggling at a Kong Dong cabinet</a>; or perhaps sitting down over breakfast for a quick game of Mr Bugs Wordys Nugz.
</p>
<p>
That's the unlikely title developer Josh Wardle once considered for his daily word game phenomenon Wordle before settling on the one that's since become a household name. "Had I called the game Mr. Bugs," Wardle admitted to an audience at the recent <a href="https://config.figma.com/agenda/session?session_id=d418949a2beb&amp;lang=en">Figma Config conference</a>, "I like to think it would not have been successful."
</p>
<p>
Wardle was speaking during a presentation detailing Wordle's long development (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24186786/wordle-original-name-mr-bugs-wordy-nugz-wardle">The Verge</a>), revealing some of decisions he'd made along the way. That journey began in 2013 when, while trying to make something that might appeal to his partner, he mashed together words and Mastermind to make an Android game. Perhaps surprisingly, the core of Wordle was there right from the start, giving players six turns to guess a five-letter word.
</p>

<p>
There were detours and deviations along the way, however. One prototype shown during Wardle's presentation was endless in design, quickly following one word with another, while a second attempt to refine Wordle's essence introduced lives. Nothing quite clicked, and eventually Wardle lost interest, putting the game "on the back burner" for six years. It wasn't until he started regularly playing New York Times games like Spelling Bee in 2020 that an idea struck and, returning to Wordle the following year, he built a version inspired by their once-a-day design.
</p>
<p>
And the rest is history. For the first six months of its existence, Wordle was played solely by Wardle and his partner, but one day they shared the website with family, who shared it with friends, until it turned into the global phenomena it is today. Wardle, of course, stunned the world in January 2022, when he decided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-buys-puzzle-game-phenomenon-wordle-for-seven-figure-sum">sell his meteorically successful game</a> to the New York Times for a seven-figure sum. And this, he told conference attendees, was simply because, "I didn't want to run a games business. I'm interested in creating things."
</p>
<p>
Nor did he want to monetise the game to turn it into a career. "All of this comes back to [the fact] I'm building the game for my partner," he explained. "I'm not going to show her ads or try and upsell her on a premium subscription... [but] it quickly became apparent to me that there were other people who were going to make money off Wordle, whether I was involved or not." In the end, he added, "selling to The New York Times was a way to just to step away." Would the publication have been quite so interested in Mr Bugs Wordys Nugz? Who can say.
</p>
<p>
In the end, though, Wardle's closing advice for fellow developers was simple: "Don't try to make Wordle. Make the thing that you're passionate about that is meaningful to you. And then everything else will follow from that."
</p>

He says much of the problem boils down to characters not feeling “tanky” enough, and it requires support heroes to focus all their healing on them just to sustain a fight. This means support players are somewhat tethered to tanks, so two of three roles are struggling, while he damage heroes light everyone else up.</p><p>As a result, the team has started using a new internal metric of “tankiness” that measures the number of hero deaths a tank character has compared to how many they “ought to experience.” Keller says that he can’t go into detail for what an expected death rate entails, but says that players’ struggles with the tank role are backed up by the data Blizzard uses internally. Some of this was intentional and a result of recent changes, but most tanks (except Wrecking Ball) moved “a lot further” down in survivability compared to other roles. The headshot damage reduction for tanks helped, but it’s still not where the team wants it.</p><p>Now that the problem’s been identified, Keller says the team is looking to see how they can address this, both with broad changes across the game and targeted tweaks for different heroes. Some ideas mentioned in the blog post include reducing the impact of the damage role passive, and giving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-patch-notes-reinhardt-kiriko-1851553176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-patch-notes-reinhardt-kiriko-1851553176">Reinhardt’s shields some buffs</a></span>.
