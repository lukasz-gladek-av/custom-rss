		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been delayed once again after missing its amended release date of October 31st, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/22/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-to-october-31st/">been previously pushed back from a September 5th release date.</a> The new release date is December 12th. The reason for the delay this time is due to Reef Entertainment needing to put together the physical editions of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and that will take some effort.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a fresh new look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and while much of the footage is recycled from previous trailers, there were definitely a few interesting new shots to consider.</p>
<p>One of these is pretty throwaway at first glance, but a few fans online believe it might be hiding a pretty significant hint. It occurs at <strong>0:23</strong> and depicts a weird little insect creature crawling/slithering along the ground and leaving a trail of gunk in its wake.</p>
<p>So what is this thing, then? Well, chances are it's probably just one of the game's normal enemies, but some folks think it could be something more. If you cast your mind back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_hunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a>, you might remember that Kanden, one of the bounty hunters Samus encounters on her journey, is able to transform into the slug-like Stinglarva form, much like Samus' own Morph Ball ability.</p>

<p>Could this strange insect in the Prime 4 trailer actually be Kanden in Stinglarva form? Well, we're not entirely convinced at this stage. For starters, while we can't get a really good look at the creature, it nevertheless differs in look to Kanden. It's not quite so mechanical in nature, and we're certain it's also sporting a pair of hefty mandibles and some tiny little legs.</p>
<p>Then again, designs can be changed, so we're not going to rule it out <em>completely</em>. We'll keep an open mind, but we reckon Samus has enough on her plate with that cheeky monkey Sylux roaming about. Goodness knows she doesn't need to deal with Kanden too!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/open-world-airship-building-survival-rpg-echoes-of-elysium-launches-in-early-access-this-december.1344511/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After it was first announced in April 2024, and after a public demo and beta tests, developer Loric Games has given its open-world airship-building survival game, Echoes of Elysium, an early access release date. It'll arrive on PC on Steam on December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Loric Games confirmed the news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2644050/view/563639088757867952?l=english">in a post on the game's Steam page</a>, which also included a new trailer featuring some cinematic looks at gameplay.</p>



<p>"<em>Echoes of Elysium has been a dream project for us</em>," said Loric Games co-founder, Ray Soto. "<em>We wanted to build a world that feels alive, one where you can build, explore, and truly feel free in the skies. That moment when your ship lifts off for the first time...it's pure</em> <em>magic</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Early this year, ahead of Echoes of Elysium participating in one of this year's Steam Next Fest events, I got the chance <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/">to preview Echoes of Elysium and check out the demo ahead of its public release</a>, and hear a presentation from the developers. I spent a fair bit of time with the game then, and while its sky-high setting felt like both a pro and a con, I went away looking forward to seeing the game evolve further. At the time, I wrote, "<em>If you like MMO survival crafting games and a bit of ship building, then it's worth your time to check out the demo when it's available, but for now, the sky being the only limit to Echoes of Elysium is both a bit of a blessing and a curse. Hopefully, one day it's just a blessing.</em>"</p>



<p>I wouldn't be surprised to jump in at early access and see it still struggling with some of the issues I highlighted in my preview, but the benefit of its early access state is that we know it'll evolve and improve over time. As I said before, if you're already into open-world survival games like this, Echoes of Elysium at least looks like one to keep an eye on.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/813723/fortnite-disneyland-game-rush-launch-metaverse</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-and-fortnite-show-hints-of-budding-metaverse-with-new-disneyland-game.1344508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">Disney invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games</a> to build a “persistent universe,” there’s been very little indication as to what that may eventually look like. But the latest collaboration between the two companies might be the biggest hint yet — and it looks a lot like Disneyland.</p><p>On November 6th, Disney is launching a new <em>Fortnite</em> Creative island called <em>Disneyland Game Rush</em>. It’s essentially a minigame collection, with each of the seven games based on a Disney parks attraction, all connected by a hub area that’s reminiscent of the theme park. Disney says it’ll be available for “a limited time.”</p><p>I had a chance to check out most of the games ahead of time and it’s all relatively simple stuff. There’s a <em>Haunted Mansion</em> game where you can explore the space to find coins and secret areas, and a <em>Spider-Man</em>-themed shooting gallery where you’re blasting away robot spiders. When you enter the island, the minigames are queued up at random, so one moment you’re shooting stormtroopers, the next you’re trying to climb an icy Matterhorn Mountain.</p><p>The games aren’t as elaborate as, say, the various offerings from Lego, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game">which include a survival game and a social hub</a>. But it does feel like a test for the metaverse-like world Disney and Epic want to build together. It may take place inside of <em>Fortnite</em>, but <em>Disneyland Game Rush</em> is also a mostly self-contained space; there’s little in the way of real violence outside of some <em>Star Wars </em>blasters, and the cosmetics you can unlock are only available on the Disney island. (At one point, I unlocked a golden Minnie Mouse hat by finding a secret key.) But it’s still <em>Fortnite</em>. I played through the level wearing a Kaws skin with Jean Michel Basqiat art on my back, and the experience I earned in <em>Game Rush</em> carried over to the rest of the game, just like any other user-made island.</p><p>This structure sounds similar to what Epic EVP Saxs Persson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">suggested to <em>The Verge</em> last year</a>. “Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built,” he explained. “We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a <em>Fortnite</em> experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.”</p><p><em>Disneyland Game Rush </em>feels like an early attempt to see how that idea might work in practice. And it comes as Disney-owned properties continue to flood the battle royale, which is currently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/811877/see-you-in-springfield">in the midst of a <em>Simpsons </em>takeover</a>. It’s easy to see these ideas converging for a Disney-specific space, one that has ties to <em>Fortnite</em> on a technical and social level, but also one that Disney has complete control over. In essence, a virtual theme park.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/813723/fortnite-disneyland-game-rush-launch-metaverse]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I called out sliding as one of my favourite aspects of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-out-now-and-the-best-thing-about-it-so-far-is-bumsliding-through-a-buried-desert-city">a launch-day write-up</a>. It lends the looter shooter a gambolling giddiness you might not expect from its heavily laden packmule characters. In more practical terms, it makes you harder to hit and allows you to flank or retreat while regenerating stamina, the catch being that you might slide into somewhere you'd rather not be, like directly beneath a bunch of Hornets.</p>
<p>After a few hours spent doing migrant penguin impressions in Buried City and Blue Gate, a thought occurred: hang on, this is almost like the hypermobile ski shooting in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tribes-ascend">Tribes: Ascend</a>. I mean, not really, but perhaps if they made friction a setting on custom servers, this crouch-walking pillage 'em up could be a bona fide movement shooter.</p> <!--more-->
<p>You think that's a horrible, silly idea? Damn, I wish you'd been around to interrupt while I was interviewing Embark's executive producer Aleksander Grøndal last month, shortly before launch. Having picked his brains about the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">item economy</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">usage of generative AI tech</a>, I asked him whether the game's sliding had been tricky to implement. I was ghoulishly hoping for a tale of terror akin to the wrangle at BioWare and EA over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dgdvayz_hQ">letting players fly in Anthem</a>, but according to Grøndal, sliding has been a straightforward part of the game "since its original inception", though it used to be a lot, er, slidier.</p>
<p>"The only thing we've done since that time is rebalance it, more or less," he said. "The game [used to be] a bit more hectic, and people were moving around a lot faster than they're doing today. So it has been toned down quite a lot, right now. It's also relegated partly to the ability tree, where you can upgrade your sliding, and that could make it a bit faster and you can go a bit further with that slide, depending on what type of terrain you're in, and your velocity relative to when you start the slide itself."

</p><p>It was at this point that I broached the Tribes comparison. Would Embark ever consider giving players the ability to turn off the friction and enable low key anti-gravity, in certain circumstances?  Grøndal chuckled at the idea, but he also didn't wholly shut me down.</p><p>"Certainly, that's something we could play around with," he said. "We do have different conditions that could change the way that the players are moving around on the map. And one could easily see that if it becomes whiter and colder, friction might change. And maybe there's things that change for the player in the different environment. So, yeah, why not?" </p>
<p>All of this will, of course, come a firm second to ensuring that Arc Raiders stacks up as a (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">so-far worthwhile</a>) game of hiding, seeking, sneaking and shooting. "I think as long it doesn't get wild and the game starts losing its core tenet around trying to create consequence to your actions," Grøndal added. "Every action should feel deliberate and sort of mean something - you might reveal where you are, or you might spend some stamina, you know. There's always some choice for you to make."</p>
<p>Casting my eye across the internet as speedily as a greased penguin reconnoitring a hillside ruin, I detect a mixture of opinions on sliding. Back in October, one playtester threw caution to the winds and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/discussions/0/811336158986493338/">called it OP</a> in public, though I'm including that post mostly for the response suggesting that Embark introduce "a second health bar specifically for your ass" to keep sliding in check. Still, there doesn't appear to be any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-ops-6-leak-gives-naughty-players-get-access-to-the-max-payne-ish-omnimovement-system-for-the-first-time">omnimovement</a>-esque controversy among Arc players about the game's handling. So why not furtively add a friction setting in the course of your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-first-roadmap-promises-lots-of-goodies-like-a-new-map-quests-and-more-before-the-end-of-the-year">seasonal updating</a>, Embark? Give the Hornet's nest a kick.</p>

"If we were actively working towards bringing WoW to consoles, or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying, 'We're actively working towards it, we know we have a lot of work to do but it's a place where we want to land.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Hazzikostas said the team's focus is still on PC and that major changes coming in Midnight to class ability rotations, more readable endgame encounters, and built-in tools that don't require players download add-ons are about "approachability."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KDhK0_vuoJ4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rumors about WoW coming to consoles have only heated up in recent years following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-acquires-activision-nearly-two-years-later-bobby-kotick-resi/1100-6516016/" data-ref-id="1100-6516016">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023</a>. More recently, WoW's upcoming changes, as well as a recent report that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-might-ditch-multiplayer-paywall-report/1100-6535732/" data-ref-id="1100-6535732">next Xbox will essentially be a PC</a> that allow players to launch Windows and apps like Battle.net, have led some to believe even more strongly that WoW will be coming to consoles sooner rather than later. Even former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra added to the rumor mill in a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/former-microsoft-and-blizzard-exec-says-new-xbox-consoles-are-just-pcs-and-that-might-be-why-world-of-warcraft-is-killing-addons/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">since-deleted post on X</a>, stating "Maybe this is why they are killing add-ons.

<figure data-uuid="13ef8c2ae915b"><a title="Luigi's Mansion 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/13ef8c2ae915b/luigis-mansion-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has provided the clearest indication yet that it intends to acquire more development teams to "strengthen its internal development organisation".</p>
<p>The comment can be seen on page 54 of its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">financial report</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-plans-to-strengthen-their-game-development-capabilities-by-expanding-facilities-and-acquiring-other-developers-as-subsidiaries.1344088/">ResetEra</a>), in which Nintendo lays out the steps involved in utilising funds to build the business foundation. It outright states that its plan includes "initiatives such as acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries and augmenting our development facilities, and the construction of Corporate Headquarters Development Center, Building No. 2".</p>
<p>This might, on the surface at least, go against <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-would-rather-organically-expand-the-organisation-than-rely-solely-on-acquisitions">Nintendo's statement last year</a> in which it said it would rather "organically expand the organisation" over the acquisition of developers. Though while this latest reveal from the company appears to indicate a more aggressive stance, we can't imagine Nintendo suddenly going on a development shopping spree anytime soon.</p>
<p>It's an interesting shift from the company though, right? Could we perhaps see a team like MercurySteam join the fold after its exceptional work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>? It's nothing but speculation on our part for now, but we think it's clear that more acquisitions will happen in the future – possibly within the next financial year.</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how things develop in the coming months and years, at least. Switch 2 is going to be an exceptionally important console for Nintendo, and the company will want to ensure that it has all hands on deck to keep the games flowing.</p>

			<p>A PlayStation 5 cross-buy feature, which would allow users to purchase a game from the PlayStation Store and receive a free copy of the same game for other formats, may be on the way, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985788815030861860">yesterday's report from Amethxst</a>, who discovered new icons recently added to the PlayStation Store which suggest that a cross-buyfeature could be on the way, known leaker billbil-kun posted a new report on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757">Dealabs</a>, confirming that these new icons can be indeed found on the PlayStation Network, and can be seen by inserting special characters into the "About" section of a PlayStation Network account.</p>



<p>Although the addition of these symbols is recent, the development of a PlayStation 5 cross-buy feature appears to predate their introduction. In some of the site's CSS files, billbil-kun discovered the "crossbuy-tag" tag in certain file properties, and this tag has been confirmed to have been added to the PlayStation website back in June 2025. As this isn't data from the PlayStation Vita days where some titles were released as cross-buy games for the handheld and home consoles, it definitely seems like something is indeed in the works.</p>



<p>While the presence of a PS5/PC icon seems to suggest that this cross-buy feature will allow users to get the game on either platform and receive the other version of the game for free, there's the chance that this feature could also involve the rumored PlayStation handheld, which is said will launch alongisde the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>Even if this weren't the case, PlayStation 5 and PC cross-buy would still be very interesting to see, not only for achieving parity with <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-xbox-play-anywhere-doing-well-adoption-big-third-party-publishers-will-come/">what Xbox has been offering for years</a>, but also to explore how this would work on handheld devices. Is a PlayStation PC storefront on the horizon as well? Hard to say at this time, but the possibility is definitely there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As we near the one-month mark of Battlefield 6 being on shelves, there's no denying that it has had a strong commercial launch. It sold more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">7 million copies in its first three days</a>, and as of the time of this writing, the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#max">concurrent player count on Steam has not dipped below 200K</a>. That doesn't mean it's been entirely without its issues, of course. Thankfully, EA and Battlefield Studios seem to be listening, since one of the game's biggest issues is getting a "<em>major overhaul</em>" based on player feedback.</p>



<p>That issue is, of course, the pacing of the game's progression regarding its challenges and assignments, which, when completed, move you through the battle pass, unlock weapon attachments, and in many cases, new weapons, since several weapons in your arsenal in Battlefield 6 cannot be unlocked purely through levelling up.</p>



<p>"<em>As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback</em>,<em>"</em> Battlefield Studios <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229">writes in its announcement</a>. "<em>This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You might recall that it was clear Battlefield 6 had an issue with its progression <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">once players started to farm XP in bot-filled PvE Portal matches in droves,</a> more than what is usual in the case of Battlefield, since that ends up happening in some form for each game. EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">did its best to shut that down,</a> but thankfully, it has gone beyond that to actually trying to address the root of the problem, which is that getting anything in Battlefield 6 is too much of a grind.</p>



<p>Today's update adds over 90 adjustments to challenges and assignments, with some of the key ones being that weapon assignments for all weapon types have been simplified, and damage requirements have been reduced from 10,000 to 3,000. Mode-specific assignments have been standardized across the board; they now only require two wins per tier instead of five. Multi-kill and kill streak goals have been reduced from twenty multi-kills down to five, and challenges for each of the different classes can also be completed much faster.</p>



<p>It's good to know that EA and Battlefield Studios are paying attention to complaints players have raised about progression, and hopefully, within another month's time, we'll see the state of progression in the game in an even better spot than it is now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/livber-smoke-and-mirrors-review-slo-dancin</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/livber-smoke-and-mirrors-review-slo-dancin.1344466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the things essential to a healthy relationship with games, both as a player and creator, is the occasional trips to the shop. Branch out, check the shelves, and when you pick up your usual, there’s a face staring at you that you’ve seen before, but not like this – not with such a sly smile. That’s how <em>Livber: Smoke and Mirrors</em> came into mind.</p>

<p>This is the debut commercial title from Turkish developers InEv Games, a psychological horror VN that’s been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/1l33564/would_you_look_at_my_disco_elysiuminspired/" rel="nofollow">making the rounds through gaming circles</a> with comparisons to titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">Disco Elysium</a> </em>-- a noble partner. You play as Elbek, a young man living in Gaia who, five years ago, condemned his lover Lilith to be killed after witnessing her practicing black magic. All those years later, and with a letter inviting him to their former home, you retrace the steps that lead not just to their love, but also to Elbek’s beginnings.</p>

<p>Despite the initial comparison to <em>Disco Elysium</em>, you’d be hard-pressed to find much more beyond its presentation. As a VN, <em>Livber </em>stays in that static area, showcasing still, but nonetheless compelling, imagery, with the narrator a character in and of itself. Quite often, they and Elbek will find themselves casting diatribes between each other, in what becomes the center piece of the story.</p>



<p>In reality, <em>Livber </em>bears more resemblance to legitimate cinema. Films that came to mind in the initial stretches of the game were titles like Andrzej Żuławski’s <em>Possession</em>, and Pedro Almodóvar’s <em>The Skin I Live In</em>, and I could conceivably draw a path to the two. What inspirations <em>Livber </em>wears on its sleeves tend to dissipate over time, forming into something else that’s a lot more absorbing, especially in those face-offs between Elbek and his past.</p>

<p>Of course, that isn’t to downplay Elbek and Lilith’s history either. Early on, it’s quite clear that animosity is the name of the game, surprisingly for both parties. With Elbek, this antipathy comes across as quite immature, even when things become more fleshed out and developed, while Lilith? Lilith seems to play the host, an unjust, albeit obviously unhinged, curator.</p>

<p>That established conflict pays off in hefty dividends quite early on, but as you get a grasp of the world of <em>Livber </em>– with InEv being so kind as to provide on-the-spot glossary definitions for Gaia’s history – that conflict fades into something much more nebulous. Soon enough, it turns into an entire extension of testing Elbek to his limits, with callbacks, consternations, and commitments, most of which come from the narrator.</p>



<p>It’s a valid path to take, however, the writing doesn’t do much of a stellar job at convincing you of the stakes, in what is <em>Livber</em>’s weakest aspect narratively. There are bigger schemes at play here, but in terms of portraying what is happening, the lexicon used to describe it is quite restrictive. You’ll see a lot of repeated adjectives, for repeated objects of permanence – lidless eyes, constant mentions of black sludge, cooling air, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>This can be an issue, considering how <em>Livber </em>is exceptionally proud of its density. Claiming to have 60,000 words written for the title, InEv quickly finds struggles in emphasizing a lot of it with that unique flavor. That variety in path branching, or different contexts, can’t or won’t amount to much if it’s going to be emblazoned with the same descriptives.</p>

<p>There’s an exercise at first where the sound design is trying to run in tandem with the writing, which would’ve excused both at any point should one dip in quality. You hear it in the first couple of scenes, these howling winds, cutlery scraping across crude crockery, the loop brilliantly maddening. It’s not long before the game forgets this however, and sooner rather than later, you’re sitting in silence, with an overbearing soundtrack to boot.</p>



<p>In its purest essence, <em>Livber </em>has all the pieces to succeed, each and every single one of them showing their brilliance at different instances, but rarely will they all intertwine. Lilith’s sheer anger is portrayed with such a brooding quiet at first, when she slowly and succinctly explains her past, and the way she dances into Elbek’s mind. It’s quite mesmerizing, as much as it is antagonizing.</p>

<p>That quickly stops, as suddenly, all that arises is directionless braying that repeats and insists upon an establishment that feels like we should've been prepared before the insanity kicked in. It doesn’t feel like there are points where Elbek is allowed to stand steadfast with his own testimony, with the choices you make, but instead, a narrator who really oversteps their boundaries as a questionable entity. It’s an annoying concept, especially when <em>Livber </em>WANTS Elbek to establish the world around him also.</p>

<p>There are also repeated instances of what I can only describe as “creepypasta writing”. At its worst, its juvenile conceptions of madness – TyPiNg lIIIIIIIIKe ThiS….. – the kind of grating annoyances that’d upend a <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>ROM hack where Red says a curse word. It tends to overturn the generally surrealistic setting of <em>Livber</em>’s scenarios, and makes it all feel modernistic, in a relatively periodic title, with timelines and codexes to consider.</p>



<p>It’s hard to extract any sympathy for… anyone presented by the end of it. It’s truly, awfully difficult to come to any conclusions for the characters, other than “where have you been?”, “what have you done?”. Despite that glossary of Gaia and Livber coming in handy quite often, those two concepts don’t get the limelight they should contextually receive, especially when discussing the prejudice and distressing wrath Lilith faced at the hands of others.</p>

<h2><em>Livber: Smoke and Mirrors&nbsp;</em>| Final Verdict</h2>

<p>I think <em>Livber </em>had a blueprint to succeed greatly. Those first few scenes where InEv is building the track are fascinating, but we’re on a road to nowhere. Despite its density, it’s underwritten, despite its history, it’s unexplained, and despite that fire, the fuel is lost in the agency to bring an unnecessarily airbrushed conclusion. Quick to stick to a plan that never involved you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tales of Xillia Remastered Review - Seeing Double]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-xillia-remastered-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-xillia-remastered-review-seeing-double.1344463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s hard to believe it’s been nearly 15 years since the original release of <em>Tales of Xillia</em>, but here we are. That’s notable because it marked the 15th anniversary of the Tales of series, and today Bandai Namco is celebrating 30 years of these stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s an appropriate time to revisit an anniversary game for this reason, thus the release of <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, which marks not only this particular milestone but also the game’s first time outside of its original PlayStation 3 version.</p>

<p>Much like its recent cousin, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></a>, <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> promises visual updates and a number of quality of life updates across the board. Similarly, it’s not a remake, so if you’ve played it on PS3 already, you know what to expect, or at least I did going into it.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_05.jpg?itok=kQfBVYNo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_05.jpg?itok=usVnEX-4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who haven’t, however, <em>Tales of Xillia</em> is a game whose strength relies on its characters and particularly its dual protagonists – Jude Mathis and Milla Maxwell.</p>

<p>From the onset, the game invites you to choose one of the two to follow for the length of the story. For those new to Xillia, it’s Jude who will provide most of the context up front. Milla has a different perspective, but from a narrative standpoint, I think it makes more sense to go with her on a second run through.</p>

<p>The story itself still plays up both protagonists along the way, as well as the development of their relationship with each other and the other characters they meet during their journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Tales of Xillia</em> begins with a watercolor-scape of a world known as Rieze Maxia. Right away, we’re introduced to Jude (or Milla if you’ve gone that route), a medical student who is looking for his missing teacher. He eventually encounters Milla as she saves him from becoming a military experiment designed to power a spirit-stealing weapon known as the Lance of Kresnik.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_02.jpg?itok=rACqKgD3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_02.jpg?itok=uG6k-fRA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Milla’s own elemental companions get absorbed instead, the pair end up on the run, and a series of circumstances has them clashing with a king who believes in the Lance’s power.</p>

<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg, however, as a greater plot and even a terrorist organization reveal the world isn’t as small as it seems.</p>

<p><em>Xillia</em>’s main story is fairly straightforward, and I think it leans on the usual Tales of tropes to decent success. Its biggest strength is the colorful cast of characters – Alvin, Leia, Elize, and Rowen – who all bring their own individual stories and how they gel with each other over the course of the story in a way that allows for emotional investment on the part of the player.</p>

<p>Alvin in particular remains one of the standouts for me, even if his motivations are a little too easily read and he’s ultimately kept around for his usefulness. My only real complaint is that things could have been fleshed out a little further. There are a lot of interesting ideas that are only surface-level, and a deeper exploration could have gone a long way to fleshing out the world’s lore.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_04.jpg?itok=WpllhRPP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_04.jpg?itok=aCHgI6ME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Xillia</em>’s battle system (known as the Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System) remains as fast and as fun as ever, with four characters placed into action combat. One character can be controlled by the player while the other three are directed by the computer – a feature which can be strategized properly in the menu settings.</p>

<p>Battles themselves happen in real time, so attacking with weapons or artes consumes Technical Points. What makes <em>Xillia </em>stand out from other games in the series is the ability to link up with a partner character, with which they can then perform linked artes and other unique abilities, provided the Linked Artes Gauge on the side of the screen is full.</p>

<p>Doing so can trigger Over Limit, which means the characters have immunity to stagger, and unlimited artes during the duration of the battle.</p>

<p><em>Xillia</em> makes use of Skills in its systems as well, which can be obtained by leveling up the skill tree-like Lilium Orb using earned GP.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_03.jpg?itok=hc0VECQv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_03.jpg?itok=YzxiD6VP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I think it’s all very streamlined in a way. You can customize a lot of the character attributes to the style you want to play. For example, I built Jude to focus more on attacking, while characters like Elize and Leia were more suited for healing. Milla, Alvin, and Rowen were more balanced between the two, but you can do whatever you want for the most part.</p>

<p>The remaster takes this up a notch by including the Grade Shop right away, which is a sort of New Game+ give yourself all the cool abilities upfront addition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other add-ons include the ability to autosave anywhere, toggling enemy encounters on the field, a retry feature for normal battles, subtitles for battle scenes that weren’t previously available, and a whole host of smaller map additions, and the ability to skip cutscenes. A lot of this stuff is super helpful for both returning fans and for that inevitable second playthrough to see both sides of Jude and Milla’s story.</p>

<p>From a visual standpoint, <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> is about what I remember it being like on PS3, just ported up to work on PlayStation 5. That means they didn’t really redo much at all in terms of the models or the sparse environments. The colors do look a little more vibrant, and the framerate is solid, so that counts for something. Unfortunately, the English audio quality still sounds compressed in some areas, particularly with Milla's voice.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_06.jpg?itok=Wk2QR1y1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_06.jpg?itok=UPUOnohR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It’s pretty much what you’d expect from a typical remaster – and that’s not a bad thing. It’s not like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-crisis-core-reunion-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core Reunion</em></a>, where they put a whole new coat of paint on old bones, and that’s just fine. <em>Xillia</em>’s life as a PS3 game was built on those limitations, so they had to get creative with the art style, and that still holds.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> is a fine game. If you’ve never played it before, it’s finally out there for you to play on modern systems. For returning fans, the quality of life improvements make getting back into it a breeze.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the story isn’t as fleshed out as it could be, the snappy gameplay systems make <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> an easy choice for those looking to pick up a relatively short RPG.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-donkey-kong-2000641323</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-things-we-just-learned-from-nintendo-about-its-switch-2-plans.1344454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2 is doing well. Like, really, really well. Nintendo revealed earlier this week that it’s already <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-nintendo-10-million-mario-kart-world-2000641025">sold over 10 million units</a> and is revising its forecast upwards for its first year. It’s already the fastest-selling console at launch ever. Nintendo also revealed that the original Switch may still be on track to beat the PlayStation 2 as the best-selling console ever. Where does this leave the Mario maker and its plans for the future? Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa shed some light on the Switch 2’s first three months and what comes next, including doubling down on movies, in the company’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest presentation to investors</a>. Here are some of the takeaways.</p> <h2>Expect to see way fewer Nintendo games for Switch 1</h2> <p>Furukawa told investors that the updated hardware is the “new standard for the Nintendo Switch concept” and that it will now shift its “primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.” While there are still a few first-party games coming to the old Switch, and third-party publishers are likely to support it for years to come due to the massive install base, Nintendo sounds like it’s ready to move on.</p>

 <p>Does that mean we’ll start seeing fewer Switch 1 versions of new games like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>? It certainly sounds like it. That would be in sharp contrast to the PlayStation 4, for example, which received last-gen versions of new Sony blockbusters up through <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>.</p>

 <h2>There aren’t plans to discontinue the Switch 1 anytime soon</h2> <p>That might make it sound like Nintendo only wants players to buy the Switch 2 moving forward, but it clarified later in the presentation that it doesn’t currently have any plans to cease production of the last-gen console. If people keep buying it, Nintendo will keep making it.</p>

 <p>“While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor,” Furukawa said. “While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Super Mario&nbsp;Galaxy Movie</em> is just the start of its big Hollywood push</h2> <p>Following the billion-dollar box office sensation of 2023’s <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, Nintendo has a sequel coming in 2026 and a live-action<em> Zelda</em> adaptation coming in 2027. Nintendo’s presentation included a slide labeled “building a framework for a consistent release cadence.” Beneath it were two additional slots with question marks, suggesting plans for more movies are already in motion.</p>

 <p>That lends credence to a recent rumor that Nintendo is looking to spin off a number of its top characters into feature-length films. There’s already a <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">registered copyright hinting at a<em> Donkey Kong</em> movie</a>, but it’s easy to see Nintendo trying to adapt other franchises as well, like<em> Pikmin</em>, which appeared in recent Pixar-like animated shorts.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> shows a major break with the past</h2> <p>Nintendo turned the Switch 1 into a juggernaut almost entirely with its own games. It’s leaning a lot more on third-party developers to build momentum for Switch 2. “Nintendo Switch 2 has the largest third-party software lineup for a new Nintendo hardware ever,” Furukawa confirmed in the company’s presentation. That started with getting <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> ported and will continue through next year with <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appearing day-and-date on a Nintendo console, the first time the franchise has done so in decades.</p> <p>This feels like an obvious move but it was not always thus. Wii U chased a handful of third-party blockbusters like <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and <em>Batman: Arkham City</em> but couldn’t get companies to support the platform with newer releases. The shift was even more stark in the early years of the Switch when Nintendo retreated even further from the console specs race. With Switch 2 it seems much more eager to openly court support from outside publishers.</p> <h2>16 percent of current Switch 2 owners didn’t own a Switch 1</h2> <p>Nintendo also shed some interesting light on the breakdown of adoption for its new hardware. While 84 percent of Switch 2 buyers did own a Switch 1 in the past, the company added that sales were evenly split among players who joined that platform at different points in its lifecycle. “Consumers who purchased Nintendo Switch between its launch in 2017 and the launch of Nintendo Switch 2 have been uniformly migrating to Nintendo Switch 2,” Furukawa said. In other words, the Switch 2’s record sales so far this year weren’t just because of the same people who bought the Switch 1 in its first year.</p> <h2>Cash is still king</h2> <p>Nintendo has roughly $13 billion in cash on hand. It says maintaining those reserves and deploying them judiciously is one of its key strategies for weathering the exceptionally “volatile” and hard-to-predict industry of gaming. Specifically, it says it’s still looking to spend on “acquiring development companies” and to “secure more development time if necessary” for existing games. One of those is no doubt <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which was first announced back in 2017.</p>

              <p>Three years ago, Valve launched its portable PC gaming handheld device, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Steam Deck</a>, and shook up the industry in a big way. But while the Steam Deck is great and changed how people play games, it had one annoying quirk: You had to keep the screen on to download games. Sad times. Those days are gone now with the latest Steam Deck update.</p> <p>On November 4, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984">Valve quietly announced</a> that it had added a new feature to the Steam Deck to allow the device to complete all active downloads while the screen was powered off. Once the Deck is done downloading stuff, it then enters sleep mode. This new feature is enabled by default when your Steam Deck is plugged into power and can be turned on manually when in battery mode by hopping into Settings &gt; Power and enabling it.</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1985833346761666723">https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1985833346761666723&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Once enabled, the next time you try to turn off your Steam Deck using the power button while it’s downloading content, you’ll be asked if you want it to keep downloading with the screen off. The Deck will enter this mode if you leave it idle for long enough, too. While downloading games with the screen off, if you move the Deck or press a button, a new status screen will appear showing a download progress bar.</p>

 <p>It’s wild that it took Valve three years to implement this feature, as it feels like something the Steam Deck should have been capable of since launch. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1h3xjqw/can_games_download_with_the_screen_off/">If you look around Reddit</a> and elsewhere online, you’ll see people asking if they can download games with the screen off, and being confused when people answer no. Some users would dim their screens as low as possible or use other workarounds to download new games without the screen being on and burning through battery, but it was never fully supported until now.</p> <p>The highly requested feature is available as part of the Steam Deck beta and preview channels, but I suspect it will be live for all users in the near future. The Steam Deck continues to get better and better.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-download-games-with-screen-off-new-feature-valve-update-2000641334]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-arc-raiders-have-a-solo-mode-solo-queue-explained.1344448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hundreds of thousands of players have populated ARC Raiders since day one, but many want to play solo. If you’re looking for a single-player experience, we’ve got everything you need to know, and if it’s possible.</p>



<p>Many of us grew up in a bygone era of single-player-only gaming. Multiplayer wasn’t a BIG thing until the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, and then it took off. Still, many prefer a solo experience, and in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, especially, you may want to explore the surface alone, inviting peril and possibilities.</p>



<p>Let’s check if ARC Raiders offers a solo queue option.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-solo-queue-in-arc-raiders">Can You Solo Queue In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It can be lonely. Credit to Embark</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play ARC Raiders solo, and it’s possible to set up matchmaking so you’re hopefully not forced to join up with any players.</strong></p>



<p>Companies in 2025 are still not giving players complete autonomy over their game when it would seem like a logical option. For example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s REDSEC battle royale launched with no solo</a> mode, only Duos and Quads. It left many solo-oriented players confused and frustrated, and understandably so.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Embark aptly doesn’t want you to embark into the world of ARC Raiders with other players if you don’t want to. Read on for instructions on how to ride solo quite easily.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-solo-in-arc-raiders-explained">How To Play Solo In ARC Raiders, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>You need to set the ARC Raiders “Fill Squad” option to “Off,” and doing so means your chances of a solo game are almost assured.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple to do, but here are the quick steps to play solo:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up ARC Raiders.</li>



<li>Go to the main <strong>Play </strong>menu screen.</li>



<li>Look in the bottom-right corner where it says <strong>Fill Squad</strong>.</li>



<li>Switch this to <strong>Off</strong>.</li>



<li>This massively increases your odds of getting a solo game—but it’s not guaranteed.</li>
</ol>



<p>The prospect of going into ARC Raiders solo is scary. You’re even easier prey for squads of merciless players, and it’s tougher to take down various types of ARCs on your own. We didn’t see that playing solo would be easy! Although we should mention the skilled individual who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-queen-arc-raiders-someone-did-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo’d The Queen in ARC Raiders</a>.</p>



<p>But the choice is there, if you want it. You have free rein to complete the objectives you want to do, bring home a bigger haul of loot, and look out for numero uno—you.</p>



<p>Let us know if you think more games should prioritize solo queues and matchmaking. Yes, it’s the world of online multiplayer, but one you can still enjoy by yourself.

In fact, it might be listening to feedback more than ever, as one of the most requested features for the handheld gaming PC is finally being added soon.</p><p>One of the weirdest quirks with the Steam Deck is the requirement to have the handheld's display on to download games. You weren't able to put the PC into sleep mode to conserve battery while downloading a new game, which is especially irritating for large downloads and those using the burn-in prone Steam Deck OLED. Valve seemingly has finally acknowledged that this is silly, and has introduced the ability to download games in a new power-saving mode in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Steam Deck update</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally X Is Good, But Has Issues</p>
      </div>
<p>Available in preview before going live to all Steam Deck users, the new mode is automatically enabled when you plug your handheld into power. While a game is downloading, the screen will automatically turn off and continue in the background, with a new information screen showing progress being displayed if you move the handheld briefly or press a button.</p><p>The same mode can be enabled in the settings menu for when the Steam Deck is running off its battery, with Valve optimistic that this low-power mode will conserve as much as possible. If the battery depletes to 20%, the Steam Deck will automatically go into sleep mode and pause any active downloads.</p><p>Valve has remained coy on a successor to the Steam Deck despite its age, with reports suggesting that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-2-release-is-over-two-years-away-according-to-new-rumor/1100-6534362/" data-ref-id="1100-6534362">new, upgraded model might only arrive in 2027</a>. In the meantime, ASUS and Microsoft have recently launched the ROG Xbox Ally X with AMD's new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip that offers improved performance over most other handheld gaming PC's on the market, albeit with some compromises.

                <p>The Switch 2 is already the fastest-selling Nintendo hardware to date, and data coming directly from the company indicates that most Switch 2 owners also owned a Switch 1.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings briefing</a>, the company revealed that 84% of Switch 2 owners were Switch 1 players who made the jump to the new hardware. The figure is based on Nintendo's data as of September 30.</p><p>"This high percentage shows that many consumers who enjoyed Nintendo Switch are smoothly transitioning to Nintendo Switch 2, allowing us to maintain our relationships with them across platform generations," read Nintendo's report.</p><p>If you're interested in more detailed breakdowns, Nintendo also included a fun bar graph in the report, showing the proportions of Switch 1 owners who transitioned to Switch 2 by the time they received the older console.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4596882-screenshot2025-11-05at9.27.12%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4596882" data-ratio="0.5703125" data-width="1792" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4596882-screenshot2025-11-05at9.27.12%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4596882"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4596882-screenshot2025-11-05at9.27.12%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>While Nintendo didn't include any exact percentage numbers in the year-to-year breakdown, the company said that there is "no concentration in any specific period" and that Switch 1 purchasers have been "uniformly migrating to Nintendo Switch 2. Even so, it's evident that those who recently got a Switch 1 aren't as eager to upgrade compared to early Switch 1 adopters.</p><p>The earnings report included numerous insights into Nintendo's strategy going forward--the company is unsurprisingly shifting its "primary development focus" to Nintendo Switch 2, and it plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-teases-more-movies-to-come/1100-6535943/" data-ref-id="1100-6535943">maintain a steady pace of movie releases</a> based on the company's properties.</p><p>Still, Nintendo has some notable Switch 1 titles coming up, including Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream. It certainly helps those transitioning between hardware that almost all Switch 1 games are playable on Switch 2, with Nintendo acknowledging in its report that given the "widespread adoption of Nintendo Switch software, [the company is] seeing that many of these titles are also being played on the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware." </p><p>According to Nintendo, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">sold over 10 million Switch 2 units</a> as of the end of September. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-platforms-of-all-time-and-how-many-units-they-sold/2900-5124/#13" data-ref-id="2900-5124">sales for the Switch 1 are creeping closer</a> to those of the Nintendo DS, the latter of which is the company's best-selling hardware ever--at least, for now.</p>

<p>News on the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC is right around the corner, with The Pokémon Company announcing updates will be shared very soon.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A released on October 16 for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, with major headlines being the return of Mega Pokémon to the franchise and major tweaks to the battle structure.</p>



<p>More content for Legends: Z-A is imminent with the previously announced Mega Dimension DLC on the horizon, and significant updates are coming sooner than we thought.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>As shared by the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1986071211579941235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Serebii</a>, The Pokémon Company has announced that an update for the Mega Dimension DLC will be shared on November 6 at 11 PM Japan time, which is 2 PM GMT and 6 AM PT.</p>



<p>No exact details have been shared on what the news will be, though it’s possible that a release date for the DLC will be announced, perhaps alongside a new trailer that outlines the additions to the game.</p>



<p>We already know that Mega Dimension will introduce two Mega Evolutions for Raichu, with Hoopa playing a central role, and further Mega Evolutions for other Pokémon could be revealed.</p>



<p>The Mega Dimension DLC will also bring more Pokémon to Legends: Z-A, expanding the Pokédex further, alongside new story content and side missions.</p>



<p>Full details are still to come, but excitement levels are certainly rising for more news to be shared, particularly as we edge closer to the 30th birthday of the Pokémon franchise next year.</p>

Some of the original criteria did not fully reflect that intent, and we have updated them to make their difficulty and purpose clearer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first set of changes went live today, November 5, through a server-side update and are available immediately. Any progress you’ve already made will automatically be applied when you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet based on the updated criteria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios said the scale of its plans for Challenges and Assignments is “large and will take place over multiple server-side and client-side updates,” so players can expect additional updates in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 has enjoyed a record-breaking launch, some have critisized the pace of in-game progression, which this update looks to address. Other hot topics include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">the size of Battlefield 6's multiplayer maps compared to those in previous games</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">out-of-place soldier skins</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including word on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-hidden-room-discovery-has-players-developing-theories-and-searching-for-easter-eggs"><u>the hidden firing range room that players are investigating</u></a> for secret Easter Eggs and hints at future content.

Below we’ve highlighted a few examples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Class Challenges</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.</li><li>Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li><li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support.</li><li>Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle:</strong> Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mode &amp; Unit Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Conquest 2: </strong>Wins in Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 5 wins to 2.</li><li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Mastery</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">General “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives.</li><li>Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.</li><li><strong>Adaptable 2:</strong> Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

"Cloud Streaming also makes it easier to enjoy PS5 games on the go – at a hotel, cafe, friend's place, or anywhere else with a high-speed internet WiFi connection – since you can keep playing even when your PS5 console back home is powered off or is in use by another account."&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside this update, PlayStation has implemented a new UI for the Portal, including a Remote Play home screen, a Cloud Streaming home screen, and a search screen. You can check it out in the image below:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios has made sweeping changes to challenges today, reducing the required milestones for class assignments,  weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more.</p>
<p>This was revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229?t=hLk3LaaiyV47LOqtvFCxKQ&amp;s=19">Battlefield Community Update post</a>, which notes that over 90 challenges in total have been tweaked to be easier. The post states that this came following ongoing player feedback.</p>
<p>The post states: "As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback. Some of the adjustments in this update are substantial, and we wanted to share more context on how we arrived at them.</p>

</figure>
<p>"This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length."</p><p>Changes have gone live today, and progress across affected challenges have been retained post-update. That means that for many players, they'll boot up the game and find a suite of previously incomplete challenges have been mysteriously accomplished. There will, according to the post, be additional updates addressing challenges in the near future in which further adjustments to completion requirements will be made.</p>
<p>Challenges in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <em>have</em> proven exceptionally grating for a subset of the playerbase since the game's release. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oms515/these_challenges_can_absolutely_suck_the_will_out/">Take this post by user AwkwardSoldier</a>, who posted a screenshot of support healing and LMG suppression challenges, titling the post: "These challenges can absolutely suck the will out of you". So players have been suffering big time trying to finish these, which is likely where the aforementioned feedback has come from.</p>
<p>It's yet another tweak to Battlefield 6 made following its release, following a nerf to aim assist as well as updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">addressing weapon bloom</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-makes-temporary-adjustments-to-xp-earned-in-strikepoint-mode-to-maintain-fair-and-consistent-progression">removing Strikepoint XP exploits</a>. Whether or not this will tame the increasingly loud Battlefield 6 community throughout Season 1 remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The year may be coming to a close sooner than we’d all like, but there’s still plenty of big releases on the horizon, including Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got all the details on early access availability.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 and PC</a>, with expectations for the title high as over seven million pre-registrations have been filed for the game.</p>



<p>With such a high amount of interest, it’s only natural to wonder if early access is available for Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-where-winds-meet-early-access">Can You Play Where Winds Meet Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Patience. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access to Where Winds Meet, meaning that, even if you do splash out on the pre-order edition, you won’t be able to jump into the game early.</strong></p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is not offering any early access incentives for players, and everyone will be able to jump in at exactly the same moment when the global servers are released. Naturally, given that there could be thousands of players looking to enter the game at the same time, you may encounter some server issues—but they should be resolved quickly.</p>



<p>The bonus is that nobody will receive a head start in the PvP elements of the game, with everyone starting on the same foot, but it also means patience is required.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-where-winds-meet-early">Is There Any Way To Play Where Winds Meet Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is no way to play Where Winds Meet early, as the servers for the game will not be opened until the launch takes place.</strong></p>



<p>While there was a closed beta earlier this year, offering players the opportunity to try the game out early and provide crucial feedback, those doors have long closed. Additionally, any progress made in the beta will not transfer over to the full release, and players will have to start again from scratch.</p>



<p>On top of that, Where Winds Meet has a global launch, with doors opening to players around the world simultaneously. Therefore, there’s no way to jump the queue by adopting the popular New Zealand trick that is utilized by many players for other releases.</p>



<p>If you really were desperate to play Where Winds Meet early, you could head to China, where the game has been released since December 2024, but the easiest approach is just to wait it out.</p>

Games [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/yeah-us-games">Yeah Us! Games</a> announced. <span id="more-1004741"></span></p><p>“As a long term fan of both BMX and video games, I’m thrilled to be able to bring them both together in <em>Streetdog BMX</em>,” said Yeah Us! Games’ Adam Hunt in a press release. “I can’t wait to get the game out into the world and see other fans enjoy it as much as I do!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Yeah Us! Games:</p><blockquote><p>Spin, flip, grind and shred through six jam-packed maps where the streets become a biker’s playground. Players can master their latest combo in the skate park and then show off their skills off buildings, rooftops, construction zones and more. Each location offers more than just tarmac for tires – discovering the full breadth of these maps can lead players to new challenges, tricks and hidden areas, all while perfecting their craft at the same time.</p><p>Nailing that perfect combo may be “tricky” enough for some, but for the more adventurous there are over 270 challenges that will see players push their creativity to the limit. Race against the clock, master an ambitious stunt, break records and reach new heights to grind through each challenge. If players can best the bike and beat all 270, there’s no need to hit the brakes—<em>Streetdog BMX</em> dares players to keep biking and experimenting, hitting even higher scores and inventing creative new combos. </p><p>Created by BMX riders, for BMX riders, <em>Streetdog BMX</em> recognises that every player is unique. From how they play, down to how they look, this action-packed title ensures a truly custom experience as individual as the people behind the handlebars. Players can customise their bike to match their style, and choose from a range of outfits, hairstyles, tattoos and accessories before showing off on the streets.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
