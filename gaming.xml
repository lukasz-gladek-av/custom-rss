			<p>If we rated things based solely on looks, the Gioteck WX5+ would immediately score top marks. This wireless controller for Switch, Switch 2 and PC boasts Hall Effect sticks and triggers and a pair of pro back buttons, but it’s the visual design that immediately grabs you. The delightful ‘Crayons’ livery is tied to RGB lighting, making this one of the most visually appealing controllers we’ve seen in a very long time.</p>
<p>At £24.99, Gioteck has also made one of the cheapest wireless controllers out there, especially considering all the features that Gioteck have crammed in. In terms of value, you’re simply not getting Hall Effect, programmable back buttons, RGB, a 3.5mm headphone socket, gyro and vibration anywhere else at this price point.</p>
<p>That budget pricing isn’t even immediately obvious when you pick it up. It is quite light in the hand, but the plastic that’s been used feels solid, and the textured grips help to keep it set in place.</p>



<p>While the Crayons livery is my personal favourite – who doesn’t want their controller to look like melted cake? – the other options are equally eye-catching, especially the 60s-flavoured Spiral and the multi-coloured mess of Doodle. If you’re a more serious type – or a teenage boy – there’s Dark Camo which is much more understated. There’s probably more chance of losing it, though.</p>

<p>Each of the analogue sticks houses colourful RGB rings as well, but it’s the performance of these Hall Effect sticks that’s most impactful. They’re pleasingly taut, returning to centre with a reassuring certainty, and they feel excellent in use. The Hall Effect tech should also mean that they are exceedingly long-lasting, outperforming standard potentiometer-equipped controllers that are more likely to suffer from stick drift.</p>

<p>The triggers are also Hall Effect, meaning that they’re a touch more accurate, while also benefiting from the frictionless tech. You can also switch them between analogue and digital performance, potentially cutting out a few more milliseconds of reaction time when playing shooters and other competitive titles, even without physical lockouts, which are ultimately the only thing the WX5+ is really missing. If you’re playing on Switch or Switch 2, the whole analogue trigger thing will be lost on you, but in a multi-platform house it’s a nice thing to have.</p>
<p>The only component that I’m not entirely sold on here is the cross-shaped D-pad. It feels too large under your thumb, and the left and right response feels slightly different. It didn’t cause any problems while playing, but there’s something about it that doesn’t feel as well-made as the rest of the WX5+. The other face buttons, and the shoulder buttons too, are reliable and responsive, and it’s just a bit odd that the D-pad feels as different as it does.</p>

<p>Around the back of the controller, there’s two programmable ‘pro’ buttons. These sit well under your middle fingers when you’re naturally gripping the controller, but with enough resistance to ensure you don’t accidentally activate them when you’re getting increasingly frustrated with purple shells ruining your peerless driving in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>The Gioteck WX5+ is practically a no-brainer in a household that’s looking for a great-value second controller, and it even makes a compelling cost-effective argument against the official Switch 2 Pro Controller as a daily driver. In the hand, there is an obvious difference in terms of quality, particularly in the plastics used, but when you’re in the midst of the action, the WX5+ is a deeply reliable performer.</p>

            <p>Ok, yep, it's one of RPS' biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>/Fallout heads, here to tell you about some New Vegas mods that've recently dropped. Why? You might ask that. You're quite right to. It's because there's a general Fallout modathon going on over on Nexus Mods right now, and I've spotted a few works released as part of it so far which I reckon are worth informing you of. Especially since next month's gearing up to be pretty damn New Vegasy, thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">a certain TV series</a>.</p>

<p>The first of these mods which have caught my eye is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94650?tab=description">Cargobots</a>, from modder Outlander3k. As you can see above, it sticks brilliantly to the established New Vegas theme of items being delivered by entities which sometimes run into peril by adding in a quest to unlock a "regional cargobot system". You're working with a Follower of the Apocalypse who seems like they'll be sending you off to scour the wastes for downed New Vegas cousins of the delivery drones which play various roles in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of new weapons to grab, and the reward for completing the quest is a remote which summons a cargobot to fly in a portable box you can store stuff in. It's far from the first time Fallout modders have gotten into providing extra means to conveniently store junk, but it's a nicely fleshed out addition to the base game's Mojave Express drop-offs.</p><p>Also linked to the courier picking up stuff as they roam the wastes is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94643">The Long Road Ahead</a> by QwibQwibMods. It adds in a set of clothing you can upgrade at different stages in your journey to reflect your character's growth and the path they've chosen in the main story. You start off by picking up your old courier clothes at Doc Mitchell's and a "Bullet Scarred Hat" from next to your grave, then find the likes of an old vest and jacket to add to this getup as you make your way to Vegas. There's a set of prototype riot armor and helmet to add to the mix once you get there, and faction trinkets around the Mojave you can use to put a visual spin on the ensemble, with all these upgrades being installed at a workbench. It's like being given the likes of the courier duster as a reward for completing the DLCs, but with a bit more personal choice and uniqueness.</p>
<p>Starting to round out this little rundown are a couple of mods which add in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/92752">extra animations</a>, with one being <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94055">Taunting</a> from Intotherough, which satisfies your craving for emotes by letting you wave at or give a thumbs down to Caesar. Basically, you gesture at any NPC, and they'll react with a quick response or by getting hostile.</p>
<p>In terms of quest mods, this one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94399?tab=description">Enclave spies</a> looks like it could be fun and there's one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94431?tab=description">zombie cows</a> that looks plenty zany, though the latter appears to potentially include some some AI-generated voices. Whether that's a dealbreaker if it is the case is your call, but personally I still much prefer mods that are clear they've used either fresh human voice acting, remixed vanilla lines, or just plain text at the moment.</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the works that've gone up so far in this lengthy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon">Fallout modathon</a>, which Nexus Mods are running with different weekly themes all the way up until the end of December. So, worth keeping an eye on for a month and a bit yet to see what else goes up if you're in the modding mood.</p>

<p>The release date for Marvel Cosmic Invasion draws ever closer, and Insider Gaming has all the details so you don’t miss a second in the push to force Annihilus back into the Negative Zone.</p>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion from Tribute Games and Dotemu pits players in control of famous Marvel characters against the horde of bug-like enemies from the Negative Zone, and it’s confirmed to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/9-new-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-next-wave/">available day one on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>If your Spidey Sense is tingling and you can’t wait to jump into the new beat ’em up title with a classic look, this guide has all the details you need.</p>

<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is set for release on December 1 across pretty much every possible platform, including last-gen consoles and the original Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>The beat ’em up title featuring a host of Marvel characters, including Captain America, Nova, Venom, Spider-Man, and the Silver Surfer, battling against the threat of Annihilus.</p>



<p>15 playable heroes will be available, with the Cosmic Swap tag-team system allowing players to switch between two selected heroes quickly to combine for creative team-ups and devastating moves, all brought to life with retro, full-color pixel art designs.</p>

<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is expected to release across all platforms simultaneously at 8 AM PT on December 1, with no opportunity for players elsewhere in the world to jump in early.</strong></p>

<p>Ranked Battle Season 3 will kick off on <strong>27th November</strong> at <strong>6am UTC</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>18th December</strong>. Those who reach Rank S or higher in this season can nab themselves a Chesnaughtite which, as you might expect, can be used to evolve Chesnaught into Mega Chesnaught.</p>
<p>What's more, the previous season's Mega Stones will also be up for grabs again this season, with Greninjite being awarded to all those who reach Rank Y and Delphoxite to anyone who hits Rank V. None of these stones are available through normal gameplay, so it's well worth taking part if you're a fan of the Gen VI starters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7mvxghr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><span><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/2k-games">2K Games</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hangar-13">Hangar 13</a> are rolling out their major “Free Ride” update for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. Available across all platforms, this free addition to the crime sim prequel is chock full of new features, including a new, more open-ended way to experience one of 2025’s most overlooked video games.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - Free Ride Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHnpuVKyCAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>The titular “Free Ride” mode, will allow players to immerse themselves in the criminal underworld of Sicily’s Valle Dorata as they complete a series of combat, stealth, and racing challenges away from the linear narrative campaign of Mafia: The Old Country. Completing these challenges will earn you Dinari which can then be used to purchase new outfits, weapons, vehicles, and charms that can be used in both Free Ride and the main campaign.</span></p>
<p><span>But that’s not all, other key features from today’s update include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>First-person driving</b><span> for petrolheads who admire the game’s garage of vintage vehicles and dry-by vistas.</span></li>
<li><span>A dedicated </span><b>photo mode </b><span>feature for snapping cinematic in-game moments, character portraits, and gorgeous period environments.</span></li>
<li><b>Classic difficulty </b><span>for made men seeking the ultimate challenge.</span></li>
<li><span>The all-new </span><b>Cinema Siciliano</b><span> mode that transforms Mafia’s visuals into a classic black and white movie, complete with an authentic-sounding audio filter.</span></li>
</ul>


<p><span>Overall, the Free Ride update for Mafia: The Old Country introduces a clever remix of gameplay elements that will certainly help add some longevity to what is the shortest Mafia game in the franchise. And while it doesn’t transform the prequel into a full open-world experience, the new Free Ride game mode will meet some of those Mafia purists half way.</span></p>
<p><span>According to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/take-two-interactive">Take Two Interactive</a>, Mafia: The Old Country has exceeded the company’s expectations and, despite being snubbed by The Game Awards, it has received a generally positive reception from fans and critics. Hopefully, the game’s success will signal the viability of smaller, lower budget AAA games within the market that don’t all have to chase the same open-world or live service formulas.</span></p>

            <p>Ho there, embarrassing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> fans! Not had enough D&amp;D in your life lately? Pining for the Owlbears, is it? Feeling a bit shrivelled for lack of magic missiles? Baby want some Helldusk Armor? Perhaps you will be consoled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a>. It's a Forgotten Realms-themed adaptation of Resolution's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>, a co-op tactical RPG co-created by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> developer Mike Booth, which is itself a homage to tabletop. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>We were keen on Demeo, with Alice Bee and Edders (RPS in peace) hivemindedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demeos-pc-version-is-a-cool-trpg-hangout-that-probably-wont-get-as-many-players-as-it-deserves">deeming it</a> "a cool TRPG hangout that probably won't get as many players as it deserves". It began life as a homely ole VR game, but has since made the leap to cutting-edge flatworld display technology. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether Alice and Ed's dire predictions were born out, but I imagine the Demeo format will be automatically more interesting to a lot of you for being transplanted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icewind-dale">Icewind Dale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a> Wood and Cragmaw Castle - these being among the places you'll visit in Battlemarked's two launch campaigns, with more to follow as DLC. 
</p>
<p>The game sees up to four players joining turn-based raids on craggy, grid-based maps full of traps, treasures and pugnacious figurines. Character classes include paladin, sorcerer, ranger and rogue, while enemies range from dire wolves and kobolds to giants. Going by trailers, I'm not sure it'll support the mad knock-on effects you get in the Larian game, but then again, Larian are to spell and ability combos what vultures are to the steaming corpses of recently slain paladins. There's something to be said for a party-gatherer that keeps things relatively clean.
</p><p>I enjoy the game's grabbable vinyl aesthetics, and I like how your thrown D20s physically bounce around the corridors of the map at hand. The question I have is naturally whether it'll stack up well as a solo game: you can command your whole party in skirmish mode if you're short on buds. Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Game is amazing. I just like to be different."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Omelet You Cook, a roguelike cooking game on Steam, has been having a great early access it seems. It recently passed 500 player reviews, and every last one of them was positive, making it one of a rare few games on Steam to have 100% positive reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As pointed out to us by developer Dan Schumacher of SchuBox Games, the game received its first negative review today. And sure, negative reviews are just part of the deal when releasing a game on Steam. But what really bothered Schumacher is that according to the text of the review, the reviewer didn't actually dislike the game. They played for 0.8 hours total, 0.2 hours when they posted the review, and wrote the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Game is amazing. I just like to be different."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to the reviewer for further comment ahead of this piece but didn't hear back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The community appears to have sprung to Omelet You Cook's defense, as the game has received almost 40 new positive reviews in the 14 hours since the negative review was posted, and a number of people have commented scolding the negative reviewer for ruining the positive streak just for kicks, though some of those comments are unfortunately far harsher than the negative review itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Seeing this review was very draining for us," said Schumacher to IGN. "We knew 100% wouldn't last forever but it hurt to have the streak ended by someone who in their own words thinks the game is amazing. Emotionally I think I'd feel better if it was someone complaining about bugs, or design choices, or just feeling the game isn't for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A single negative review is hardly the end of the world for SchuBox Games, but it does make a difference. There are very, very, <em>very</em> few games on Steam with perfectly positive reviews, or at least in meaningful amounts like this. The more you get, the more likely it is someone will have something bad to say. There's a game called Shooters, Ready! on Steam that's only available in Japanese and similarly has over 500 positive reviews and 0 negative ones. But at least using the built in search by user reviews, there don't seem to be any others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Schumacher, having no negative reviews actually did afford him some benefits, too:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having 100% positive reviews was a huge benefit for us because it's extremely abnormal for a game with hundreds of reviews," he told IGN. "People see 100% and become curious enough to read through some of the reviews to understand why it's so beloved or to check out the demo for themselves. We've had multiple people join our Discord or leave their own review and mention that they gave the game a chance because they couldn't believe it was maintaining 100% for so long.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Omelet You Cook Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"...The biggest impact this will have on Omelet You Cook is losing that mystique of a perfect 100%. That led to some opportunities for Omelet You Cook to be mentioned because it was atypical. But honestly for players coming across the Steam page, I don't think 99% vs 100% makes any difference at all. Some users like to filter by negative reviews to understand where the pain points are and I have to appreciate that this negative review frames Omelet You Cook in a very positive light."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's long been known that engagement with games on Steam in the form of Wishlists and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-developers-think-of-steam-reviews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews</a> can be a massive boon, especially for small developers. There are simply too many games, and getting attention on such a crowded storefront is impossible if you don't already have a built-up audience or a lot of advertising money. Having lots of positive reviews and few negative ones gets games like Omelet You Cook visibility when searching under certain filters or ranking systems, <a href="https://steam250.com/hidden_gems" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including third-party ones</a>. That's certainly been the case for Omelet You Cook</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're very fortunate and grateful to have reached 507 positive reviews before our first negative," Schumacher said. "We worked incredibly hard to achieve that with 15 content updates over 5 months. But we also got incredibly lucky and it's nowhere near a flawless game. There's plenty of valid reasons somebody might have a negative experience with the game and we're grateful to all 507 chefs who took the time to write a positive review. Each one helps Omelet You Cook reach a wider audience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <p>Just Cause developer Avalanche has closed its Liverpool studio, following the cancellation of Xbox exclusive Contraband earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-avalanche-studios-closing-uk-studio-in-workforce-restructure-following-cancellation-of-xbox-exclusive-contraband">Avalanche announced it had initiated "a collective consultation process"</a> back in September. It has now moved forward and closed its Liverpool studio, laying off 31 members of staff in the process.</p>

<p>The developer shared an update on its <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">website</a> last night. "The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project," reads the message from Avalanche.</p>
<p>"We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avelanchers through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities."</p>
<p>Contraband - a 1970s co-op open world caper set in the fictional Southeast Asian world of Bayan- <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-avalanche-announces-contraband">was first revealed in June 2021</a>, during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase. "With Contraband, we're taking everything we've learned from 18 years of being in the forefront of open world games as well as bringing the knowledge from running successful live game services focusing on our player communities," Avalanche said at the time.</p>

<p>Contraband was subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-exclusive-contraband-reportedly-cancelled-as-avalanche-states-its-active-development-has-now-stopped">cancelled by Microsoft back in August</a> of this year, with the studio writing in a statement: "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future." The game's cancellation followed on from a string of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">other game and staff cuts across Microsoft's collection of worldwide studios in June</a>. </p>
<p>After these cuts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft's CEO stated that "Microsoft is thriving"</a> as the company emphasised its focus on AI.</p>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country receives its biggest update since launch today. The 'Free Ride' update introduces many new features and content, including Classic difficulty (which requires careful management of both health and ammunition), new horse and car races, new replayable combat challenges, an optional first-person driving perspective, and a Photo Mode. </p>



<p>Those who'd like to enhance the cinematic flair of their experience in Mafia: The Old Country can now activate Cinema Siciliano, which transforms the game's look into a black-and-white masterpiece inspired by vintage Italian films. Lastly, the Free Ride update also introduces new vehicles, guns, knives, outfits, and charms for players to acquire.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country launched in early August to solid reviews from critics. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review</a>, I rated it 8 out of 10 and called it a fine Sicilian Mafia story:</p>



<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</em></p>



<p>Publisher 2K later boasted of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-sold-over-800k-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's sales</a>, revealing that it has been outperforming expectations. A couple of months ago, one of the main actresses from the game, Carina Conti, let slip that she heard the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-greenlit-mafia-the-old-country-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have already greenlighted a new game</a>. This remains unconfirmed for the time being, but the parent company has hinted that the new approach of a shorter, more linear cinematic game has been successful, thus suggesting that developer Hangar 13 will continue down this path in the future. </p>



<p>Of course, we'll keep you updated should there be any new leaks or rumors of a sequel.</p>

<p>Pickaxe Simulator is an up-and-coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-drift-36-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> incremental simulator game where players are tasked with mining various blocks using their pickaxe. The main objective of the game is to have the strongest pickaxe, thereby enabling its user to mine blocks quickly and efficiently. Players can also train their characters to be more effective while mining, increasing the amount of any material that can be mined in a given time.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Another key element of Pickaxe Simulator is Pets. These Pets, once hatched, provide users with additional benefits while mining, making the players’ operations even more profitable. While playing the game from scratch isn’t too difficult, a boost to resources at the start of the game can be quite beneficial. That’s where the Pickaxe Simulator codes can be helpful to players.&nbsp;</p>

Available in black or white, it supports PS5, Xbox, and PC, and you can switch between them simultaneously at the press of a button. You can also use it with Nintendo Switch while the console is docked. The main attraction, however, is unique HDMI 2.1 Passthrough technology, offering 24-bit/48kHz audio that should impress even the most discerning audiophile.</p><p>Aside from its cool HDMI tech, the headset is equipped with everything else you'd expect from a $300+ gadget. This includes Pro-G Graphene audio drivers (40mm), the ability to listen to two devices at once, up to 24 hours of battery life, and a mobile app to help you optimize its performance. There's also an included docking station with LED lights that lets you quickly recharge your headset between play sessions.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DB7ZW7J4?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DB7ZW7J4?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DB7ZW7J4?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Logitech G Astro A50 Wireless Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DB7ZW7J4?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DB7ZW7J4?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DB7ZW7J4?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$240 (was $300)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This offers many of the same features as the A50 X, though it skips out on the HDMI Passthrough technology.

These versions don't include the two story expansions, but they do come with the Rogue Infiltrator Character Pack cosmetics for Kay and her cute partner-in-crime, Nix.</p><p>Many other video games are seeing big discounts ahead of Amazon's Black Friday deal, so make sure you check <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub</a> for more.</p><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h2><p><strong>Video Game Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ivKJW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K5Vm3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p8zbIU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X Game Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Video Game Accessory Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p2B5eJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47JNduJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pe08uO" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Accessory Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Controller Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4i06ETu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 1/2 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4oMC9TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49sUOiJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K2LwPQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Controller Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Deal - Save $45 On Play Booster Box</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>   </ul> </div>

There is no extra content like the Deluxe Edition. It's not a short adventure by any means, so even the base game offers plenty of content to keep you engaged in its world and combat for hours to come. The game is also identical across PS5 and Xbox, though technical performance is a smidge smoother on Xbox, in case you happen to own both systems.</p>                      </div><p>Hell is Us is a dark and dreary open-world action game that refuses to hold your hand. Compared to other similar games, there are no overwhelming map markers, excessive side quests, points of interest, and so on. Instead, the game encourages you to find your own way through its world without giving you so much as a hint. For some gamers, this may be a hindrance, but seasoned veterans of the genre may appreciate the change. Despite this, the world is much more forgiving than you'd think, and doesn't aim to make exploration too complicated, at least according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hell-is-us-review-devil-in-the-details/1900-6418402/" data-ref-id="1900-6418402">our 7/10 review by Alessandro Barbosa</a>.</p><p>For more Black Friday deals, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's hub for all the latest discounts</a> on video games, Blu-rays, anime, and much more.</p><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h2><p><strong>Video Game Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ivKJW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K5Vm3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p8zbIU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X Game Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Video Game Accessory Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p2B5eJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47JNduJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pe08uO" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Accessory Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Controller Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4i06ETu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 1/2 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4oMC9TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49sUOiJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K2LwPQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Controller Deals</a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Deal - Save $45 On Play Booster Box</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Modern fighting games are designed for standard gamepads, but nothing matches the precision and feel of a dedicated arcade-style controller--especially the popular all-button "leverless" style fight sticks.

Leverless fight sticks have become very popular within the fighting game community thanks to their quicker, more precise inputs. While it might take some time to adjust to the all-button layout (especially if you are already used to a traditional fight stick), once you do, you'll be pulling off combos and special attacks with ease.</p><p>Like several other Razer products, the Kitsune has a super-thin profile and Chroma RGB lighting around the base of the chassis. The aluminum faceplate is also removable, allowing for easy tinkering with the controller. It comes fitted with low-profile optical linear mechanical switches. One thing to note here is that the Kitsune is only compatible with PS5 and PC, which is a bit of a shame considering that the PS4 still has a very active community of fighting game fans.</p></div>                      </div><p>"The learning curve is quite steep, but the payoff is well worth the effort. The lack of native PS4 support is disappointing, which would be a dealbreaker for some. But from its build quality and physical design to the ergonomics and actual performance in competitive scenarios, it's nearly impossible for me to find a notable flaw in my 20-plus hours using it," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-razer-kitsune-is-the-best-fighting-game-controller-period/1100-6517983/">Razer Kitsune review</a>.</p><p>While the sleek design makes the Razer Kitsune very portable, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GEEKRIA-Carrying-Compatible-Kitsune-All-Button-Controller/dp/B0FGJ37W9P?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">you can also pick up a dedicated carrying case for it from Geekria for $23</a>.

Battlefield 6 features both a single-player campaign and online multiplayer, but it's the latter that's earning the most praise. "Battlefield 6 is a return to form, even if it doesn't reach the same highs as the series at its peak," wrote Richard Wakeling. "The campaign is as lackluster as expected, and the multiplayer maps are only ever decent at best, but there's still a chaotic and super-satisfying shooter here that offers multiplayer thrills unlike any other. Even if you're not racking up kills by the dozens, you're still rewarded for contributing in other ways, and you're never too far away from being in the middle of a histrionic Battlefield moment."</p><p>Plenty of other video games, Blu-rays, and more are on sale in Amazon's Black Friday sale.

The wireless earbuds support everything from PS5 and mobile to Xbox and PC, making them a sleek, portable alternative to standard gaming headsets. And while they might be small, they're still packed with useful features for gaming--including a four-microphone array for noise cancellation and hundreds of audio presets for different games.</p><div title="6536234 - SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds Black Friday 2025 Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4983" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536234 - SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds Black Friday 2025 Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFX34VNZ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DFX34VNZ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFX34VNZ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFX34VNZ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DFX34VNZ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFX34VNZ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$150 (was $200)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The GameBuds are available in two formats, one for PS5 and one for Xbox. The Xbox format is likely the best choice for most shoppers, as it's compatible with Xbox, Switch, PC, mobile, and PS5, while the PS5 format drops support for Xbox. Aside from that difference, the specs are identical, including support for 2.4Ghz and Bluetooth wireless connections, a four-microphone array for noise cancellation, transparency mode, 360-degree spatial audio, a 10-hour battery life (up to 40 with the included case), and presets for various games accessible via the SteelSeries companion mobile app. </p>                      </div><p>As usual, a variety of eartip sizes are included with the bundle, ensuring you find a comfortable fit. And if you decide to take them on the road with you, you'll be glad to know they're IP55-rated for dust and splash resistance. These would be an ideal fit for someone who is constantly on the road, as transporting the earbuds is much easier than a bulky headset. In other words, you could easily pack these away for a holiday vacation--ensuring you have premium sound for all your games regardless of location.</p><p>Amazon is discounting a bunch of other SteelSeries headsets for Black Friday. This includes everything from the affordable<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F956KS26?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Arctis Nova 3P</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F956KHT9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">3X</a> to the ultra-premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZWKD9TF?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a>. Some of these are seeing up to $100 price cuts, making it a great time to upgrade your audio. Be sure to give them all a look, especially if you're looking to get an edge in multiplayer games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 or Battlefield 6, which seriously benefit from clear audio and the ability to hear nearby enemies.

The full game data is included on the disc (or the cartridge, in the case of the Nintendo Switch). That said, unlike previous eras of gaming where you could simply pop a new game into your console and start playing right away, newer titles often need to install at least <em>some </em>game data to the console's hard drive, which can take several minutes. So if you're planning to give this to a family member, a pro move would be to open the case and insert the disc in the console so all the data is installed, then wrap the gift once it's complete so they can start playing right away.</p>                      </div><p>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures is a kid-friendly game that lets players explore Who-Ville as the Grinch, tackling platforming sections through the town's outskirts, snowboarding stunt sequences, jetpack challenges, and more. The Grinch's dog, Max, is also a playable character with his own unique missions, and the game is full of collectibles that let you unlock jigsaw puzzles, art, and Grinch-y accessories. The game first launched back in 2023, but has remained surprisingly popular with players, and it even received a new DLC expansion last month titled The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Determined to Love Christmas. The expansion is available as a $10 premium download on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Nintendo eShop.</p><p>There are plenty of other early Black Friday video game deals available at Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The weekend is almost here, but before it comes, you need to smash a couple more NYT Connections puzzles! Fortunately, I’m on hand (as always) to bring you the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to ace today’s challenge. If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections puzzle, this is the guide that you need.</p>



<p>Read on to secure the tips and answers that you need to keep that streak going.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 20)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #893:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARTY</li>



<li>KISS</li>



<li>ENAMEL</li>



<li>ESSAY</li>



<li>CROWN</li>



<li>DECAY</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>PASTE</li>



<li>ANY</li>



<li>SKIM</li>



<li>PLASTER</li>



<li>PULP</li>



<li>STICK</li>



<li>STROKE</li>



<li>ROOT</li>



<li>FIX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of things you’d literally apply to bond surfaces; one is more “medical wall stuff” than “craft glue.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are words for a light touch; one of them can be romantic or just feather-light.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Mix inner anatomy and outer protection; two are internal tissues, two are what you see or what caps it.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Say them out loud. One hides a “decay” pun that echoes D-K, and another rhymes its way to S-A.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 20.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>

<p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">SHUTEN ORDER</a> on the Switch in September, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> has now been officially announced.</p>
<p>It will arrive later this month on <strong>27th November 2025</strong> for the launch price of 6,579 yen. This <strong>10%</strong> discount is available until 4th December 2025. Local pricing for the full game hasn't been confirmed just yet, but there will be a paid Upgrade Pack for existing Switch owners. Thankfully, it's only a small sum of 330 Yen (about $2).</p>
<p>As for what you can expect, the Switch 2 Edition will support a higher frame rate, including variable frame rate between 60 to 120 fps in both docked and portable modes. There will also be Joy-Con 2 mouse controls in areas of the game where it's supported.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-dmz-coming-back-catch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-dmz-is-coming-back-soon-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-catch.1358827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty’s DMZ mode is returning in December, but there’s a huge catch. The once-popular extraction shooter platform first emerged in Modern Warfare II in 2022, but after a few months of updates, it eventually disappeared from the ecosystem, never to return – until now.</p>



<p>There’s a huge catch though.</p>







<h2 id="h-dmz-recon-coming-december-11th">DMZ: Recon Coming December 11th</h2>



<p>DMZ: Recon is a new extraction shooter experience coming to Call of Duty: Mobile in December. It’s a reflection of the DMZ title that was released alongside Modern Warfare II in 2022, albeit a ‘shrunk-down’ version.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It will land during COD Mobile’s Season 11 update, and like the original, it’s set to feature PvPvE gameplay. Unlike the original DMZ, it’s expected that there will be no punishment or negativity surrounding PvP, as that was a sticking point for fans of the first platform. This is reflected in there being no ‘team recruitment’ mechanics, which were in the first DMZ.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyMobile/comments/1oyh2hg/dmz_recon_is_official_heres_what_to_expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early impressions from COD Mobile leakers</a> suggested that DMZ: Recon will be entirely first-person and will feature an in-match buy store, just like the one found in the original DMZ mode. There will be boss characters, weapons can be levelled up in flight, and loot is based on a tier system that includes extremely rare collectibles.</p>



<p>Players can reportedly purchase vehicles on the fly, and as it’s a smaller experience, only eight teams of three will occupy each match.</p>



<p>It has also been suggested that two maps will emerge at launch on December 11th: Serpent Island and Building 21. It was also claimed from those attending preview events that players arrive in the game via a wingsuit, can use killstreaks, carry three weapons, and can extract using a helicopter system, just like the first game.</p>







<p>Are you happy to see DMZ coming back, even if it’s only in COD Mobile? Let your thoughts be known via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Following its September Nintendo Direct reveal</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>There were all sorts of announcements during Nintendo's September Direct, but one you might have missed was for Gryphline's upcoming eShop release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/popucom">Popucom</a>.</p>
<p>It's described as a multiplayer co-op platform adventure title, where you'll need to master "techniques of colour switching and match-3 shooting" to overcome puzzles and defeat enemies. There's also support for motion-assisted aiming with the Switch's gyroscopic sensors.</p>
<p>In an update today, the game has now locked in a release date - with the developer confirming it will be arriving for Switch on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>According to the US eShop, this digital release will set you back <strong>$19.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) and requires around 4.3 GB of space on the Switch and Switch 2. Additionally, it supports single-system multiplayer for 2 to 4 players, and online play for 2 to 4 players.</p>
