For example, werewolf superhero Wolfpack is one of the original Creature Commandos members in the comics, known for tearing through Nazi flesh with his claws and teeth. Unfortunately, however, his werewolf nature worked against him for Gunn’s version of the team. “I definitely considered Wolfpack, and, especially, Man-Bat (one of my faves),”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>he wrote. “But I knew I wanted to tell Weasel’s story so it felt like too many rabid and fuzzy characters.”</p><p>As much as it may anger comic book fanboys who decry any deviation from the source material, Gunn wanted to make <em>Creature Commandos</em> his own. He expressed interest in not simply copying the Creature Commandos lineup from the comic books, even if it meant excluding fan-favorites. </p><p>“I considered Vincent Velcoro but wanted to choose a ‘creature’ far outside the usual roster from another part of DC - so I went with Dr. Phosphorous instead. I also considered Solomon Grundy, another favorite, but was pretty set on Frankenstein.”</p><p>His divisive choices appear to have paid off. The DC Studios animated series currently has an elite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/creature_commandos/s01&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/creature_commandos/s01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">95% Tomatometer score</a></span> on Rotten Tomatoes, and was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/creature-commandos-renewed-season-2-1236257969/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/creature-commandos-renewed-season-2-1236257969/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renewed for a second season</a></span> before the first season ended. Beyond the numbers and renewals, <em>Creature Commandos</em> stands out as the rare animated series to both subvert the superhero genre with vulgar and bloody depictions while also delivering heartfelt stories about its core characters.

Directed and written by Quantic Dream’s David Cage, it follows the story of Jodie Holmes, a girl with psychic powers that allow her to communicate with a spirit she calls Aiden. Aside from the non-linear narrative that explores different sections of her life, the game was known for its inclusion of big-name actors like Page and Willem Dafoe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cage said he is collaborating with Page on the Beyond: Two Souls TV show, though the extent of his involvement is unclear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are absolutely thrilled to collaborate again with Elliot Page on this project,” Cage said. “I was blown away by his acting performance in the game, and I couldn’t think of anyone else to tell this story with the same passion on another medium.<em> Beyond: Two Souls </em>is a very special game for millions of players around the world who were moved by the story of Jodie and Aiden, and their journey in life and beyond.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Mass Effect to be led by team of series veterans.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has announced it is restructuring Dragon Age and Mass Effect studio BioWare, moving a number of developers onto other projects within EA and focusing entirely on its upcoming Mass Effect game going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> from general manager Gary McKay, he wrote that the studio is "taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio," he continues. "We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN understands that EA has already placed an unknown number of developers from BioWare into other, equivalent roles within the company. A smaller number of Dragon Age team members are also seeing their roles terminated, and are being offered time to apply to other roles within the company if they so choose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare's structure has shifted repeatedly in recent years. The studio had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">a round of layoffs in 2023</a>., and has seen a number of high-profile departures throughout the development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the most recent of which was<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-reportedly-exits-bioware"> director Corinne Busche</a> announcing her departure from the studio last week. It is unclear how many individuals work at BioWare today. IGN asked EA for any comment or specifics on how many individuals at BioWare are being impacted by this change, how many are facing potential layoffs, and how many will remain at the studio. EA did not provide the specifics, but a spokesperson offered the following comment:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The studio's priority was Dragon Age. During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next Mass Effect. Now that The Veilguard has shipped, the studio's full focus is Mass Effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Mass Effect in question was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-mass-effect-project-is-in-development-at-bioware-with-a-veteran-team">announced four years ago</a>, and is still in the early stages of development. IGN understands that BioWare's current strategy is to prioritize one game at a time, as some developers who had been working on Mass Effect were previously moved to Dragon Age to get the project over the finish line and are now moving back. Per the blog post, Mass Effect development is now being led by series veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news comes a week after EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million">announced that Dragon Age: The Veilguard missed its player targets</a> by nearly 50% and reduced its guidance for the fiscal year due to this and, more impactfully, weaker-than-expected results from EA Sports FC 25. The company will hold its Q3 earnings conference call on February 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/gog-wants-your-dreamlist-classic-games-so-it-can-use-them-to-prod-publishers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p><em>Black &amp; White</em> was intriguing; it had classic Molyneaux over-reach and deserves, in the words of one Ars staffer, a re-release so that "a new generation can realize just how janky it is." As detailed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtNvEna6bxc">a documentary by Noclip</a>, the <em>B&amp;W </em>games are stuck in publishing purgatory. Microsoft acquired Lionhead's IP and assets, while Electronic Arts retains the publishing rights to the <em>B&amp;W&nbsp;</em>games, and nobody has yet been able to align those two very large planets.</p>
<p>GOG has added its own "Our Pick" tag to games it wants to see brought forward onto modern systems. Among them is <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/freelancer">Freelancer</a>,</em> which Ars' Samuel Axon described in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">our 2024 roundup of non-2024 games</a> as "a sincere attempt to make games like <em>Elite (Dangerous)</em> and <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> far more accessible." GOG selected <em>Freelancer</em> as <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/dreamlist-gog-staff-picks/">one of its staff picks</a> for the Dreamlist, citing its "dynamic economy and engaging storyline."</p>
<p>The main thing GOG would be fixing with&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>, as with many games, would be simple availability, as the game is not available on any proper digital storefront. Axon reports that, in having an original disc, installing <em>Freelancer</em> was not too hard, with the installer working in Windows 11. You can apply <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Freelancer">community patches</a>, like an "HD Edition" mod, but Axon preferred playing at a non-native resolution (1024×768) at 4:3 and adjusting his monitor.</p>
<p>Other notable games GOG and its voting public want to see brought back are <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>&nbsp;</em>(the original, not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-on-pc-a-gorgeous-start-but-where-are-the-toggles/">the remake</a>), the point-and-click <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/discworld"><em>Discworld </em></a>adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection"><em>Command &amp; Conquer: The Ultimate Collection</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever">The Operative: No One Lives Forever</a>.</em></p>

                <p>In the wake of EA's announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet the company's expectations</a>, BioWare has announced that it is "changing how we build games" in an effort to hold the company to "the highest quality standards."</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, BioWare GM Gary McKay said "a core team" at BioWare is making the next Mass Effect, while other team members are departing. McKay said BioWare has "worked diligently" in the past months to find new positions for BioWare staffers at other internal EA teams. Whether or not there were layoffs connected to these changes, however, is unknown. The Veilguard game director Corinne Busch has left BioWare.</p><p>"In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare," McKay said.</p><p>McKay added that, because the next Mass Effect game is so early in development, the studio doesn't "require support from the full studio."</p><p>"Today's news will see BioWare become a more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs. We appreciate your support as we build a new future for BioWare," McKay said.</p><p>EA management said earlier this month that The Veilguard "engaged" 1.5 million players, which was a big miss from the 3 million that EA expected. Whether or not this had anything to do with the structural changes at BioWare is unknown.</p><p>BioWare's track record in the past decade has been checkered. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-wins-goty-at-game-awards/1100-6424005/" data-ref-id="1100-6424005">Dragon Age: Inquisition won Game of the Year</a> in 2014, but 2015 saw the cancellation of BioWare's multiplayer game Shadow Realms. Then in 2017, BioWare released Mass Effect: Andromeda, and many remarked that it failed to live up to the franchise's lofty quality benchmarks. BioWare followed Andromeda up with Anthem, a multiplayer live-service game that faced its own share of issues and criticisms. Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which included remastered versions of the original Mass Effect trilogy, followed in 2021 and was well-regarded.</p><p>As mentioned, BioWare is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-mass-effect-features-several-veterans-on-its-development-team/1100-6485584/" data-ref-id="1100-6485584">now working on the next Mass Effect with a veteran team</a>, but no one should expect it to release anytime soon.</p>

<p>If you follow Insider Gaming, you know a few of us are huge fans of the extraction shooter genre. We play the top games in the genre in our spare time, and we’re always watching new and indie releases in the scene. But few delve into the horror scene. Now, horror extraction shooter Level Zero: Extraction has hit 1.0 with a massive patch, a vast content revamp, and even a new game mode!</p>







<p>You can check out the full patch notes below, but the developer sent over a little release detailing everything different in 1.0 compared to the Early Access version of the game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Most lights are now on by default. Alien Monsters now take damage from UV light—flashlights, glowsticks, and flares have been changed to UV;</li>



<li>Lots of new grenades &amp; weapons as well as attachments for the guns, including optics;</li>



<li>Research Facility map size increased, added two new sectors—Medblock and Radiation Tests—that require access cards to enter, printable on the map itself;</li>



<li>Mutation system for Alien Monsters: Aliens progress each session, gaining mutations that alter gameplay and add a new power layer;</li>



<li>Improved shooting, animations, item swap, and movement;</li>



<li>Contract system rework: Items are now shown on the holomap;</li>



<li>Leaderboard section: Filtering by kills, K/D, extractions, etc.</li>



<li>Rebalanced economy after a series of iterations;</li>
</ul>











<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1456940/view/500562881802142345?mc_cid=125b97a780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full patch notes</a> below or via the game’s Steam page:</p>



<h3><strong>Revamped the Caves of Turion map as a “battle royale-like” experience</strong></h3>



<p>Here’s a list of changes:</p>



<ol>
<li>The main elevator can only extract three Mercs; as the session approaches its end, the elevator can’t be called;</li>



<li>Two additional solo exits that are one-time only;</li>



<li>Better loot;</li>



<li>A ring of erosion starts moving toward the central elevator 10 minutes into the session;</li>



<li>Aliens are immune to ring of erosion damage.</li>
</ol>



<h3><strong>💼 A “Mercs Only” mode</strong></h3>



<p>This is a separate optional mode for Mercs only. It offers a more forgiving experience without Alien Monsters, but the loot is of a slightly lower tier.</p>



<h3><strong>OTHER CHANGES:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Final screen UI rework</strong>:<br>
<ol>
<li>Causes of death;</li>



<li>Names of all the people in the lobby with more details about what happened to them during the session;</li>



<li>An ability to add friends.</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>New skin attribution system</strong>: Skins are now obtainable through achievement-style goals and are never reset after completion.</li>



<li>New Alien Monster feature:&nbsp;<strong>Cocoons</strong>. When playing as an Alien, wrap a dead Merc in a cocoon; if it stays intact until the end of the session, you get a share of the loot that the Merc was carrying.</li>



<li>New weapon:&nbsp;<strong>Sniper rifle</strong></li>



<li>New grenades:&nbsp;<strong>Gas, UV Flashbang</strong></li>



<li><strong>Revised economy</strong>&nbsp;with faster progression</li>



<li><strong>Steam Friends through in-game UI</strong>. You can add other players as friends during a session—a pop-up will appear above them.</li>



<li><strong>Matchmaking update</strong>: Locked regions. If you choose a region, you will only look for games in that region.</li>



<li>Various&nbsp;<strong>UI &amp; UX Improvements</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-general-changes"><strong>General Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Added matchmaking lock for the 1.0 release to provide better latency, matching players in specific regions without expanding matchmaking to other regions.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-research-facility-changes"><strong>Research Facility Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Increased the amount and chance of weapon spawns in the warehouse and airdrops.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-caves-of-turion-changes"><strong>Caves of Turion Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>The central elevator is no longer called but instead arrives on a timer and leaves 2 minutes after arriving. Max capacity: 3 mercs;</li>



<li>The bore exit can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The Grappling Hook exit can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The solo elevator can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The loot quality on Caves of Turion has been increased.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-merc-changes"><strong>Merc Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Reduced prices for items and weapons;</li>



<li>Headshot multiplier has been reduced from x3 to x2 against mercs;</li>



<li>Rebalanced damage for all weapons according to the new headshot multiplier;</li>



<li>Added a distinct sound for headshots;</li>



<li>The starter kit weapon changed to FoxFive;</li>



<li>Increased recoil for most of the weapons by 20-30% (reverted recoil changes);</li>



<li>Reduced the amount of stamina it takes for a melee attack for both one-handed and two-handed melee weapons;</li>



<li>Reduced the damage of marksmanship rifles;</li>



<li>Removed icons of card printers from the holo map when they’re active;</li>



<li>New item: Gas Grenade, working as a perfect mix between smoke grenade and alien’s acid cloud ability;</li>



<li>New item: UV Flashbang. It doesn’t blind mercs, but it will do heavy damage to aliens close to the explosion.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, note that this update includes a complete server wipe, meaning your entire stash, trader rep, and levels will disappear, but your cosmetic skins will remain.</p>

Like last year's event, Lunar Awakening replaces all of the game's shrines with special Lunar Shrines. These shrines function much the same as their normal counterparts, only with even more powerful effects in addition to their usual ones. Lunar Artillery Shrines, for example, have a chance to blast enemies with a holy bomb in addition to piercing enemies with holy arrows as usual. Whereas Greed shrines typically just grant players more gold for killing monsters, the Lunar Greed Shrine actually makes it so every kill also has a chance to summon a Treasure Goblin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435327"></a><figcaption>Players can earn free cosmetics by slaying monsters while under the effects of a Lunar Shrine during the event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lunar Shrine bonus effects are the same as they were during 2024's event, but what is different this time is the amount of bonus XP players gain while under the effects of a shrine.

Sony has announced it's shifting the focus of its PlayStation Plus monthly games and Game Catalog updates toward PlayStation 5 titles starting early next year, and that PlayStation 4 games will only "occasionally" feature thereafter.
</p>
<p>
Announcing the news alongside its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-february-games-revealed">refreshed monthly games line-up for February 2025</a>, Sony said it was "evolving" the PlayStation Plus service to reflect the fact "many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit".
</p>
<p>
As such, PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog will switch their focus to offering PlayStation 5 titles starting in January 2026. "PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit," Sony elaborated, "and will only be occasionally offered." The company did, however, confirm it "may still" provide titles playable on both PS4 and PS5 after the changeover.

<p>
Sony also stressed the switch won't impact monthly PS4 games already claimed via PlayStation Plus. "You'll continue to have access to games you've already redeemed as long as you remain a member," it wrote. "For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh."
</p><p>
"We'll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimise the benefits you receive," the company concluded in its announcement, "including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy."

We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.”</p><p>In the meantime there are still several months of PS4 games coming to the service, with February’s newly revealed haul including the following, available to download between February 4 and March 3:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Payday 3</em> | PS5</strong></li><li><strong><em>High on Life </em>| PS4, PS5</strong></li><li><strong><em>Pac-Man World Re-Pac</em> | PS4, PS5 </strong><br></li></ul></blockquote><p>Today’s announcement gives current PS4 owners a year’s notice to reconsider whether they want to renew their subscriptions even after the main perk of the service drops out for them. But PS4 players can still claim PS5 games and eventually download and play them once they do decide to make the jump to Sony’s newest hardware. That’s one of the benefits of the current PSN ecosystem: fans’ libraries should remain intact and compatible between console generations, including (hopefully) whenever the PS6 comes out. </p><p>PS Plus subscribers on PS4 had a pretty good run, starting in 2013 with the launch of the console and <em>Resogun</em>, through day-and-date indie releases like <em>Rocket League</em>, as well as blockbusters arriving long after release like the <em>Batman: Arkham trilogy</em>. It will have been 12 years and change by the time PS Plus moves on from PS4, and a similar length of time from when Sony stopped adding monthly PS3 games after the PS4 came out (which happened in February 2019).</p><p>But there are still many months to go of new PS4 games being given away on PS Plus.

<p>Counter-Strike pro players Joshua “steel” Nissan and Braxton “brax” Pierce are now unbanned from competing at official Valve events, over 10 years after the two were involved in the notorious iBUYPOWER match fixing scandal. Whether it’s as players, coaches, or team analysts, the two can now participate at the Major.</p>



<p>After spending a decade banned from competing at the highest level of pro Counter-Strike, the two are free to pursue any opportunities.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-doors-to-the-counter-strike-major-are-finally-re-opened">The Doors to the Counter-Strike Major are Finally Re-opened</h2>



<p>Back in August 2014, members of the iBUYPOWER CS:GO roster purposefully lost a match against NetcodeGuides.com, after betting against themselves on CS skin gambling site CSGOLounge. Despite some evidence being present immediately after the match, the story wasn’t uncovered until journalist Richard Lewis <a href="https://dotesports.com/general/news/match-fixing-counter-strike-ibuypower-netcode-guides" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a report</a> in January 2015. Within two weeks of the story’s publishing, Valve handed indefinite bans to all that participated, preventing them from competing at any Valve-affiliated events.</p>



<p>These bans, coupled with bans from other prominent tournament organizers such as ESL, effectively ended the careers of the players involved. Given that they were unable to participate at any major tournament, their team options were severely limited. In 2017, the players had their bans lifted from organizers like ESL and DreamHack, however the Valve bans had been made permanent in 2016. In 2020, both steel and brax transitioned to VALORANT, with steel finding some success with 100 Thieves.</p>



<p>Valve finally relented in 2023 though, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/37331/steels-valve-ban-set-to-elapse-in-january-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making the bans no longer permanent</a> and letting them expire after 10 years. That day where the bans expire has finally come, and the players can now compete at or participate in the Counter-Strike Majors. During the IEM Katowice broadcast, a small celebration was held for steel, who’s worked on stream as an analyst for a few years. During the segment, steel said that he learned “a very hard lesson for myself, as well as for everyone in the tier two scene.”</p>



<p>The bans and their length have been a major talking point in the community for a long time. In fact, it was Richard Lewis himself who petitioned months after his original report in 2015 that Valve not leave the bans indefinite. Over the years, some have argued the bans be lifted earlier as the players had been punished enough. Some though have argued that the severity of the punishment is crucial to deterring future instances of match-fixing.</p>



<p>Has 10 years been enough for these players? Join the discussion down below or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's walking back the mandatory PSN requirement for certain PlayStation games on PC, and what's more, you'll get in-game incentives for those titles if you do decide to link a PlayStation account.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony says that beginning with the PC release of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>&nbsp;- which is due to launch tomorrow - you'll get "more benefits to playing with an account for PlayStation Network" on PC.</p>

<p><em>Spider-Man 2</em>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements" rel="nofollow"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></a>, will all be getting "in-game content unlocks" for PSN account users, and you won't be required to sign up for a PlayStation account to play them on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-psn-account-bonuses-sony.jpg?itok=W4HxF2Y8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-psn-account-bonuses-sony.jpg?itok=j6h2rUbk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony says some of its PC games, including&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, will reward you for signing up with a PlayStation account.</figcaption></figure><p>If you do sign in with a PSN account, you'll gain early access to the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and Miles' 2099 suit in&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>, and you'll get the Armor of the Black Bear set in&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, which was previously only available in New Game Plus.</p>

<p>You'll also get extra points "to activate bonus features and unlock extras" in&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em>, as well as a jacket for Ellie themed around Naughty Dog's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, in&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, you'll get access to the Nora Valiant outfit. Of course, you will need to own all of these games on PC if you want these rewards; they're not forthcoming on PlayStation 5, since you need a PSN account to play on that console anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-sony-pc-psn-account.jpg?itok=DK46RJ5b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-sony-pc-psn-account.jpg?itok=S0NuUAhY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want some in-game goodies for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>on PC? Sign up for a PSN account.</figcaption></figure><p>There is, of course, no mention of any multiplayer games losing their PSN account requirement; games like&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>will still require a PSN account for their multiplayer components.</p>

<p>Curiously, it's also worth noting that a couple of single-player Sony PC releases, like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, won't offer any goodies for signing up to a PSN account.</p>

<p>This will, however, likely set a precedent whereby single-player PlayStation games will no longer require PSN accounts to use on PC. We'll have to wait and see whether that's the case for future PC releases. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Open world spec op gun-brandisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-line">Phantom Line</a> takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll <em>wish</em> you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.
</p>
<p>
If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA">Discord</a>.

"Crashland on Jantar Island together with up to 3 of your friends (1 - 4 player co-op)," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2400840/view/534340870063784015?l=english">explains the announcement post on Steam</a>. "Plan, prepare, and adjust tactics to the open world with dynamic events. Gear up with new guns, weapon attachments, and night vision to be ready for any danger you encounter. Discover new captivating locations as you navigate towards the Black Forest Research Facility and fight the anomalies once contained there."
</p><p>
When playing the game solo, you can command other husks to serve as decoys or scouts and any other roles your supposed 'human friends' consider beneath them, or are too dense to execute correctly (that's me, hello). The NPC opposition appears split between regular soldiers, whom you're encouraged to regard as distractions, animals, whom you're encouraged to kill and eat, and invaders from other dimensions, whom you're encouraged to both slaughter and, er, become.</p>
<p>"Humanity is at war - to fight the anomalous horror, you must turn into one yourself," explains the mailout. This is done by augmenting your body with "exotic elements". Surely no downsides there. "Go die again," adds the press release, reassuringly.
</p>
<p>
Between jaunts to the battlezone, you get to hang out in a nuclear submarine, customise your artificial body, and trick out your cabin with all the phat weaponry you've acquired. Fingers crossed that it also contains a cheerful stove and a sit-down button. My husks deserve to put their feet up, now and then.</p>
<p>The basic game flow here reminds me more of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> than S.T.A.L.K.E.R., except that instead of boss lairs full of rotten hay you're diving into gobbets of spacey sci-fi horror game - in particular, I'm reminded of the backrooms of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within-2">The Evil Within 2</a>. There's no PvP element, seemingly, so you at least don't have to worry about other teams camping the exits. Anyway, you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400840/Phantom_Line/">Steam</a>.

Not only do you need the headset (which retains its $549.99 MSRP as of writing), you’ll need a computer powerful enough to handle VR gaming. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can view the PC requirements to use the VR2 here</a></span>, but the TLDR is that <strong>you’ll need a relatively powerful graphics card that has a spare DisplayPort for you to use.</strong> That last part is perhaps most important: You need to have a monitor <em>and</em> your PSVR2 headset plugged in at the same time. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 came out in 2019 and is listed as a minimum requirement, though Sony recommends either a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later for “best performance.” You’ll also have to buy the correct peripherals to make it work, since the PlayStation VR2 box isn’t going to give you everything you need out of the box. </p><p>If these obstacles seem surmountable and you’re determined to see your PlayStation Headset and your PC work together in gaming harmony, here’s everything you’ll need to get it up and running.</p><figure id="" data-id="cab3988a81bd4a774d98b8b589139497" data-recommend-id="image://cab3988a81bd4a774d98b8b589139497" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1333" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional image of the PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter.

Unfortunately, as of writing, this gadget has been habitually out of stock. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/playstationvr2-pc-adapter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/playstationvr2-pc-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s own website</a></span> doesn’t have any available for purchase (though I hope they do by the time you read this), and you’ll be lucky to find used adapters at retailers like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-black/6590039.p?skuId=6590039&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-black/6590039.p?skuId=6590039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/virtual-reality/products/sony-playstation-vr2-pc-adapter/20013568.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/virtual-reality/products/sony-playstation-vr2-pc-adapter/20013568.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a></span>.</p><p>This environment has let third parties pop up with off-brand PlayStation VR2 PC Adapters, which are riskier to use. Amazon reviews indicate that these either work poorly or don’t run at all, so an official Sony Adapter remains ideal despite its scarcity. Make sure you’re purchasing from an official storefront (check for <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D92XQL22?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/psvr2-pc-adapter-bluetooth-connection-displayport-1851750509&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D92XQL22" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">the PlayStation Store mention on Amazon</a></span>), and look for the PlayStation logo on the adapter itself.</p><h2 id="h2190"><a id="2"></a>Step 2: Get equipped with the other accessories you’ll need</h2><p>In a perfect world, the VR2 Headset and adapter would give you everything you need to get into PC VR gaming. Unfortunately, you still might have to spend some extra cash. <strong>The first thing you’ll need is a spare DisplayPort cable</strong> to connect your adapter to your graphics card. Yes, <strong>you <em>do </em>need to have your monitor and headset connected at the same time</strong>, so this isn’t a corner you can reasonably cut. </p><p>The second thing you might need is <strong>a supported Bluetooth dongle</strong>. We’ll get into this below, but some PSVR2 Adapter owners have reported needing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the Bluetooth dongles recommended by Sony</a></span> to get the smoothest performance possible. This will probably cost you about $20, though you can find lower prices if you shop at the right time.</p><p>Combined with the headset, this means <strong>you’ll need to spend between $60 and $90 in total to get your PlayStation VR2 headset to work on your computer</strong>. That’s much cheaper than buying a new headset just for your PC, but you’ll have to decide if that’s a price you’re willing to pay before you even drop cash on <em>Half-Life Alyx</em>.</p><h2 id="h2191"><a id="3"></a>Step 3: Set up your PlayStation VR2 Headset on your PC</h2><div><p>Once you have all the necessary components together, plug your adaptor into a power outlet and use your DisplayPort cable to plug the adaptor into your computer’s GPU (make sure you use the right slot!). Plug your headset into the adaptor, turn it on, and then open up Steam. </p></div><p>Next, find and download both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PlayStation VR2 app</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam VR</a></span>. Open the PlayStation VR2 App, and it’ll take you through instructions for connecting your controllers via Bluetooth. Follow the instructions, and then open the Steam VR app. If done correctly, you should see a window that looks like this when you hover your mouse over Steam VR on your taskbar.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In my testing, it doesn’t seem like you need to launch the PlayStation VR2 app every time you want to use Steam VR after the initial setup. <strong>Make sure you turn on your headset whenever you want to use it</strong>, otherwise Steam won’t recognize either the device or the accompanying controllers.</p><h3 id="h2192"><a id=""></a>What if I can’t connect my PlayStation VR2 controllers to my PC via Bluetooth?</h3><p>Depending on your setup, you may run into a wall trying to get your VR controllers and your PC to get along. While frustrating, there are a few common culprits that lead to this issue. The first is that your motherboard in your computer may be missing a Wi-Fi antenna, which will weaken both your system’s Wi-Fi connection <em>and </em>its bandwidth for Bluetooth devices. <strong>If your PC came with an antenna that you just never screwed in, I strongly recommend setting that up</strong>. You’ll get a stronger wifi connection too!</p><p>The second common culprit is… well, computers are weird. Your controllers may not even show up in your Bluetooth menu because, I don’t know, your hardware is in a bad mood I guess? In this scenario, restart your computer and give the connection process another shot. </p><p>If your back is really against the wall and you just want to use your headset, <strong>I did find that plugging each controller directly into my computer works</strong>. This of course relies on you having two USB-A to USB-C cords hanging around, but if you own a PS5 and PSVR2 headset, you should have two to work with. I’d only label this a temporary fix, as all the wires will make any game with motion controls cumbersome at best and dangerous at worst. But for games that only require basic pointing and shooting, this setup can work.</p><p><strong>If you have any persistent connection issues, or the controllers just aren’t responsive enough, I recommend looking into </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>one of those Sony approved dongles</strong></a></span>. The adapter probably should have come with one of these to save you the headache, but them’s the breaks.</p><h2 id="h2193"><a id="4"></a>Step 4: Enjoy your VR Headset!</h2><p>It’s certainly inconvenient to have to spend extra money on accessories to get this headset to work, and the Bluetooth connection issues can become a hassle if you’re not one who likes to tinker. But after jumping through the initial hurdles, I found PlayStation VR2 works pretty well on PC. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play, and the OLED screen looks great, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam reviews</a></span> indicate that some folks deal with software crashing and other glitches while using it, and you should be aware that those reports exist. That said, that hasn’t been my experience so far.</p><p>Despite a good experience when it’s all up and running, I wouldn’t recommend investing in PlayStation VR2 if your primary use case is PC VR gaming. If nothing else, the PlayStation VR2’s relative scarcity means its less supported than more widely-adopted alternatives like the Meta Quest, so there’s no guarantee that future games will be made with the PlayStation headset in mind. Additionally, some of the neatest features of the headset—such as eye tracking and HDR—aren’t supported by the PC adapter. But as long as you know all that going in, the PC adapter does its job and gives you access to Steam’s robust ecosystem of VR games. Let’s just hope that Sony actually makes more of these things so you can actually purchase one!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With February fast approaching, Sony has announced the next batch of monthly titles coming to its PlayStation Plus subscription service - this time featuring heists, at least one high, and a whole lot of gobble-adjacent platforming.
</p>
<p>
Starting next Tuesday, 4th February, PlayStation Plus members across all subscription tiers - that is Essential, Extra, and Premium - gain access to the following three titles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Payday 3 (PS5)</li>
<li>High on Life (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Pac-Man World Re-Pac (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>, it's the latest entry in Starbreeze Studios' co-operative heist series, which released in 2023 - and while it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-seeks-long-term-success-after-disappointing-launch">struggled to usurp its predecessor</a> in terms of popularity, it's still a decently good time. Vikki Blake called it a "furiously good fun, if criminally unadventurous" follow-up in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">three star review</a>, noting it unfortunately fell short of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a> in "almost every aspect". Still, its arrival on PlayStation Plus might just help give it a boost.
</p><p>
As for High on Life, Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell <em>really</em> wasn't a fan when this comedic shooter from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a> - the studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland - launched back in 2022. Edwin proclaimed it a "mediocre shooter with an unfunny attitude problem", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">slapping it with</a> the dreaded (and now rather antiquated) Eurogamer Avoid.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pac-man-world">Pac-Man World</a> Re-Pac - a bouncy remake of Namco's 1999 3D platformer Pac-Man World. We didn't review this one when it arrived in 2022, but it currently has a Very Positive rating over on Steam, which is a promising sign.
</p>
<p>
All the above will be available to PlayStation Plus members from 4th February to 3rd March, leaving less than a week to claim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-january">January's monthly games</a> - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit: Remastered.
</p>
<p>
Sony also notes PlayStation Plus' Monthly Games and Game Catalog will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-shifting-focus-to-ps5-games-next-year-will-only-occasionally-include-ps4-titles">shift their focus toward PS5 games</a> starting in January 2026. PS4 titles will only "occasionally" feature from early next year, it explains, "as many of our players are currently playing on PS5". It does, however, add, "We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date".
