			<p>Mike Morhaine is the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment, but today, he is the owner of a new studio called Dreamhaven, which was unveiled in 2020. The company has over 100 staff members and is soon preparing to announce its first game. However, no details have been released about that just yet. Instead, they have revealed that Dreamhaven will publish Lynked: Banner of the Spark, a game unveiled during Gamescom's Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>
<p>The news of Dreamhaven publishing <a href="https://wccftech.com/fuzzybot-unveils-new-title-lynked-banner-of-the-spark/">Lynked: Banner of the Spark</a> came from Jason Schreier from Bloomberg. Lynked: Banner of the Spark is the debut game from the game studio FuzzyBot, a studio that was designed so that they could make something colorful and vibrant rather than the dark and gory games that they were used to making in previous studios.</p>
<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark is considered to be fast-paced action with hack-and-slash combat, inspired by roguelites. You'll be able to make yourself stronger once you have completed a run and successfully gathered tools and resources.</p>
<p>In addition to Lynked: Banner of the Spark, Dreamhaven will also be unveiling a new game next month, which is being developed by Secret Door, one of their internal studios. This studio is also headed by a Blizzard veteran named Chris Sigaty, who was known for being the Executive Producer of Starcraft II.</p>
<p>Mike Morhaine<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-18/blizzard-co-founder-s-new-company-dreamhaven-aims-to-recreate-the-old-magic?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spoke to Bloomberg</a> about Dreamhaven and the struggles they've had with having a functioning company, especially during COVID-19, which has led to ongoing financial issues. These issues meant that Secret Door's upcoming title missed internal deadlines, hence why it's only being announced now. Eric Dodds, also known as the Director for Hearthstone, resigned for personal reasons, meaning the ideas they had at the end of 2020 were now moot.</p>
<p>Sigaty did mention that Secret Door's first game should be out next year; however, due to a small team developing the game and budgets becoming increasingly tight, it may cause delays and alterations to the timeline.</p>
<p>When asked about the future of Dreamhaven's titles, Morhaime commented: "The size of these games probably are not going to be the size of a Blizzard game. But the quality bar we're trying to hit is still there. We're trying to still put out high-quality, published games that people can love and enjoy and share with their friends."</p>
<p>In addition to helping publish games such as Lynked: Banner of the Spark and Secret Door's project, they will also be helping market games from its second internal studio, Moonshot.</p>

What that means is that he doubles as space janitor and science experiment, taking all the most dangerous jobs aboard a colony ship and allegedly contributing to humanity’s understanding of the universe every time he’s cloned, killed, and reborn in a new body. Until eventually one of those clones doesn’t die and the Mickeys seemingly rise up.</p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p> Alongside Pattinson is Naomi Ackie (<em>Star Wars: Episode IX</em>), Steven Yeun (<em>Nope</em>), Toni Collette (<em>Hereditary</em>), and Mark Ruffalo (<em>Avengers</em>). We’ve seen the clone idea played out a bit in Christopher Nolan’s <em>Prestige </em>and Tom Cruise’s <em>Edge of Tomorrow </em>(an adaptation of the manga <em>All You Need is Kill</em>). Here, writer and director Bong Joon-ho is taking it into a sci-fi dystopia via Ashton’s book not unlike his English language breakout<em> Snowpiercer </em>about industrial class warfare at the end of the world (which was also adapted from a novel).</p><p>Class warfare was also one of the themes of <em>Parasite</em>, Bong Joon-ho’s 2020 Oscar winner about a a poor family infiltrating the household of upper-class elites. It’s also nice to see Pattinson continuing to stretch his wings again after his brooding portrayal of Bruce Wayne in the most recent <em>Batman</em> movie. With the surreal black-and-white thriller The Lighthouse, the former Twilight actor proved he can balance on the knife’s edge of comedy and horror as well as anyone. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-significant-reveal-for-bungies-marathon-until-2025-its-claimed/</link>

<p>It looks like it will be a while before Bungie drops shows off what its been working on with the Marathon reboot.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-marathon-details-on-heroes-price-and-radio-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paul Tassi at Forbes</a>, sources tell him that there are no plans for any “significant reveals” for Marathon until spring 2025 at the earliest. Tassi adds that there may be something small to give a few updates on the game, but nothing major will come until next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckI_m8bbXfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-going-on-with-marathon">What Is Going On With Marathon?</h2>



<p>As of writing, Marathon still has a 2025 release window for Bungie. The game will also have the expected price point of $40 that has recently been floating around.</p>



<p>“There were initial monetization concerns that came to a head when free-to-play The Finals came out and had trouble in that area,” Tassi writes. “Helldivers 2 being $40 and being a hit for Sony secured the premium cost idea. Concord’s recent failure at $40 did not change this, and it is simply too far along to pivot back to F2P restructuring anyway, so it will launch like this, barring anything seismic.”</p>



<p>There will also be a battle pass system and cosmetic shop for microtransactions.</p>



<p>As far as the game itself, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transition to a hero system</a> akin to that of Apex Legends was reiterated. The characters in the game will have unique abilities along with the ability to customize the gear and guns you find during your runs.</p>



<p>Regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change at the top</a> with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Ziegler replacing Chris Barrett</a> as Game Director, that’s when the move to individual heroes came to be. It’s also said, however, that the game’s art style has remained in tact through the switch over.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s claimed that Marathon is in a “tough spot” with its release. Bungie has had issues with trust from Sony lately due to the struggles of Destiny 2, leading to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring within the company</a>. After the failed launch of Concord, there is heavier pressure for Marathon to be a success for Sony as a new first-party game.</p>

Internally, it has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 processor as the Meta Quest 3, 12GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage capacity. The screens have a 90Hz refresh rate, but this can be bumped up to 120Hz when connected to a PC via a DisplayPort cable. There's also MicroSD card support in case you want to load it up with games and the internal storage isn't big enough.</p><p>Another cool feature is that you can quickly swap out batteries on the Focus Vision without losing any progress, as the headset has an internal battery that supplies up to 20 minutes of juice. Each detachable battery pack can provide up to two hours of continuous playtime.</p><p>You also won't need to worry about setting tracking modules like with the Vive 2 Pro, as the Focus Vision has four integrated tracking cameras and two full-color 16MP passthrough cameras that work with an infrared system to provide accurate tracking and proximity sensing in your environment.</p><p>The streaming kit in the Amazon bundle includes a five-meter streaming cable and converter--both with DisplayPort compatibility--and this is designed to give you visually lossless graphics and low-latency data transmission.</p><p>Admittedly this is a very expensive all-in-one VR solution, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3</a> is a good blend between price and performance.

<p>Revolution Software's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-gets-september-release-date">remaster of the original point-and-click adventure</a> will still be released on PC (Steam, GOG), PlayStation and Xbox on 19th September as planned.</p>
<p>The Switch version has been delayed "to ensure the quality of play remains equally high across all versions of the game".</p>

<p>No further specific details on the Switch version have been provided, and no new release date has been given beyond October.</p>
<p>The remaster not only provides enhanced graphics and sound, it adds a new Story Mode with quality of life improvements more palatable to a modern audience. For instance, the UI will include subtle hints to help players solve puzzles.</p>
<p>Further, the remaster has provided a chance to tweak inconsistencies found in the original game, and alter the odd moment of representation.</p>
<p>Players can switch between modern and original versions of the game at any time.</p>
<p>After this remaster, Revolution is set to release the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-fans-will-be-delighted-by-original-remaster-and-brand-new-sixth-game">all-new Broken Sword 6</a> - I spoke to creator Charles Cecil at last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> to find out more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-bean-influencers-got-me.984381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/facebook-reels-beans-oh-no<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve mentioned on our <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a> before my fatal disease of watching Facebook Reels: I’ll log in to look up where someone lives or doublecheck an event, only to get sucked into hours of short-form video by people I don’t know. This is exactly what Facebook wants for me, and I am a sucker for falling for it. For a while, it was dogs (good) or clips from Dropout (also good); sometimes it’s sendups of Christianity (funny) and other times it’s actual Christians, usually conservative (not funny). Lately, though, it’s nothing but beans.</p><p>Did you know there is a universe of bean influencers out there? OK, I guess they are more likely food influencers, but they seem particularly obsessed with beans, constantly acting like they have single-handedly discovered beans and are letting me know that beans exist for the first time. They are breathless as they extol beans’ virtues: Cheap! Plant-based protein! Fiber! Versatility! They want to convince me to <a href="https://archive.is/5QtIc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat more beans</a>. They want to show me that they are innovating with beans, discovering ways to make beans delicious that no human has thought of before. They are uniquely passionate about <a href="https://www.eater.com/24008145/why-are-butter-beans-so-popular" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">butter beans</a>, which <em>is just another name for lima beans</em>, and while certainly not a popular bean where I live is still a regular-ass bean and not some bean you’d only know about if you were in the secret cool kids bean club.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Creamy Miso + Coconut Butter Beans | SO VEGAN #food #recipe #shorts #vegan #veganrecipes" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjfUWQY6FuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The recipes they make are largely pretty straightforward, especially if you are or, like me, have been a vegetarian, and so don’t have your mind blown by meals that don’t feature meat. They do a lot of beans in some kind of broth or thick sauce on the stovetop. They love serving beans over orzo or with “crusty bread.” They add vegetables. They make versions of daal or misir wat or curry that they give <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/when-it-comes-to-a-recipe-whats-in-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">English names</a>. They do all this in envy-inducing kitchens full of natural light and beautiful pans, and they wear comfy outfits and speak softly about self-care and coziness and ease. The colors are vibrant, and the sounds are soothing, and every dish is their favorite way to prepare beans and they are sure it will become my favorite too.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Butterbean stew #plantbased #healthy #healthyfood #vegan #food #recipe #yum #vegetarian #dinner" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T34iH9namts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Especially if you don’t eat a lot of meat, you’ve probably had the experience of seeing some kind of “healthy” recipe that sounds pretty good, and doesn’t have any red flags for why it <em>wouldn’t</em> be good, but when you make it it’s actually disgusting. Much like I keep falling for Facebook Reels, I often fall for these recipes. Usually, they’re full of vegetables I already like that seem like they’d be great together, but the actual recipe ends up having a weird texture or bland flavor. For a while, I kept falling for green pasta sauces that involved steaming and blending broccoli and other greens. I like broccoli, and I like greens, and these basically read like versions of the pestos I already make regularly, but without fail they were hideous, with all that broccoli making an abundance of astringent sauce. Since I live alone and hate wasting food, that means my freezer sometimes gets full of these failed experiments that I think might be better later, even though they never are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Armed with that experience, I look askance at the bean influencers’ recipes, trying not to be seduced by the colors and buzzwords and inclusion of ingredients I like, trying to parse if the recipe will<em> </em>actually be <em>good</em> or if it’s just sleight of hand around a pile of beans, which sounds good because it’s beans but will not be a thing I’ll actually want to eat once I have it. I’ll watch the videos on repeat, looking for cracks in their veneer. But sometimes you can’t <em>really</em> tell until you make a recipe for yourself.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I love butter beans" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OD80WJqGyDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This week, I had plans to make <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/gochugaru-shrimp-and-grits-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a version of shrimp and grits</a> I’ve been intending to get to for a while, but I've been busy and haven’t had it in me to thaw the shrimp and then deal with my general anxiety about cooking seafood. (I was a vegetarian for about 16 years, and I still try not to cook meat often; I was also <a href="https://www.fifthsense.org.uk/congenital-anosmia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">born without a sense of smell</a>, which when combined with my inexperience with meat has led to a sometimes-crippling paranoia about food safety.) Annoyed with myself, and hungry, and with half a loaf of sourdough I need to get out of the freezer, I finally caved and decided to make one of the bean recipes, a <a href="https://minaelleskitchen.ca/miso-mushroom-butter-beans/?fbclid=IwY2xjawEwbLNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHU3wvlFzK8oVSYF3_ImtOmMzO2GRANt-X3eJYHuZ557hzxjdgem7aeZHOw_aem_0X399IwUd_4Kw4rQnMr6nQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">miso mushroom butter beans</a> from a site I’ve never heard of but whose video had no obvious flaws.&nbsp;</p><p>I figured I’d make it with white beans, but I was surprised that my grocery store had canned butter beans. I was also surprised that they were white, like they are in the influencers’ videos, and not the green I usually associate with lima beans, which I usually only find frozen. (The different color is down to <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/butter-beans-vs-lima-beans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different stages of maturity</a>; who knew?) I was a little leery of the vegan sauce, which involved blending some of the beans along with cashews, but the sauce also had green flags in the form of&nbsp; miso and nutritional yeast, two ingredients that make anything delicious.</p><p>(If you have just yelled “<a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/packages/food-network-essentials/what-is-nutritional-yeast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nutritional yeast</a>?!” in alarm, I have been on a lifetime campaign to get it renamed to something more accurate, like “tasty dust” or “deliciousness powder.” Nutritional yeast makes <em>everything</em> good. It’s an umami-packed wonder and also has a ton of B12, which your <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/are-you-getting-enough-vitamin-b12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain and body need</a> to not feel like shit all the time.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I took the recipe’s advice and soaked the cashews in boiling water first, a step I often skip but really shouldn’t. I even used the required shallot instead of an onion because the grocery store had shallots that didn’t look too bad. I cooked the shallot and mushrooms (she uses portobello in the video, but I used baby bella, which did you know <a href="https://www.montereymushrooms.com/knowledge/are-brown-mushrooms-like-criminis-baby-bellas-portabellas-and-portobellos-more-nutritious-than-white-mushrooms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are the same mushroom</a>?), added the butter beans, then blitzed the sauce together and added it along with some frozen kale. Soaking the cashews made a big difference in making an actually smooth, creamy sauce without little flecks of cashew in it. It looked sort of gray and disappointing, but basically like the video without the added fancy lighting.</p><p>I ate it with a hunk of the sourdough I need to get through, and I'm both delighted and furious that it was actually fucking delicious. I’m always a little disappointed in the green lima beans, and while the butter beans didn’t change my life, they were good: big, meaty beans that are satisfying to eat, but would have been just as satisfying if they were the more common cannellini or great northern beans. The miso and nutritional yeast made the sauce savory and rich-tasting, with the lemon juice adding some life. It’s a little too hearty of a dish for the current warm weather in New York, but there’s a good chance I’ll add it to my rotation of fall and winter go-tos.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem here is that now it opens the door to all the <em>other</em> bean influencers’ recipes. If <em>this one</em> was good, what about the others? Should I try them? I’ve been needing more iron and protein, and also to spend less money on groceries–could beans be the answer? Have the bean influencers been right all along about the life-changing nature of beans? Have I fallen into their cursed clutches? How many bean recipes will I try before one is inevitably shit, and the whole bean influencer artifice crumbles into dust, leaving them richer off my clicks and me poorer, with a tupperware full of shitty beans?</p><p>God damn you, Facebook Reels, and god damn you, bean influencers. Thanks for the lunch, though. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a vast improvement on PlayStation 5 Pro, delivering a much better image quality at 60 frames per second over the base model, according to a new early analysis.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> released their first look at the second entry in the remake trilogy running on PlayStation 5 Pro. The analysis is based on 7-minute long uninterrupted footage set at the beginning of Chapter 2 when Cloud and his companions venture into the first open-world region of the game, the Grasslands. Right from the start, it's clear how much better the game looks on PlayStation 5 Pro, as the unnamed visual mode featured in the video delivers a sharp 4K image while painting smooth 60 frames per second. Regarding image quality, everything seems to be a massive improvement over Performance Mode on the base model, with a sharper image and better details. Many of the visual issues seen on the base model are also fixed, such as ghosting issues, distant trees shimmering, and others.</p>
<p>The same improvements can be seen in combat as well. Even during Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's most intense enemy encounters, the image quality remains sharp, with 4K-like detail. Particles have also been improved, although they reveal how the game is using PSSR, which is upscaling the image to 4K from a base resolution of 1152p or 1224p.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Digital Foundry early analysis also compares the game running on the PlayStation 5 Pro with the base model's Quality mode, highlighting how the image quality is mostly the same, with some improvements on the Pro model. With performance being solid as well, with only a few minor drops here and there, it seems like the power of the new console will benefit the second entry in the trilogy series quite a bit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-september-2024-snes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Four more SNES games have been added to Nintendo Switch Online, and unlike Game Boy Advance or N64 games, you're not going to need an Expansion Pack addon to enjoy these.</p>
<p>The first game to be added to the service's retro lineup is&nbsp;<em>Battletoads Double Dragon</em>, a Rare-developed beat-'em-up that serves as a crossover between the two titular franchises (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battletoads-puts-up-its-dukes-on-august-20th">both of which</a> have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-revive-announcement">since seen revivals</a>).</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, it's a combination of the fast and furious button-mashing action of both&nbsp;<em>Battletoads&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon</em>, so check this one out if you've got some frustration to work out on your controller.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battletoads-double-dragon-nintendo-switch-online-september-2024.jpg?itok=MNz0U_Cv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battletoads-double-dragon-nintendo-switch-online-september-2024.jpg?itok=4lXrQkPD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battletoads Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>should provide some enjoyable beat-'em-up action on Nintendo Switch Online today.</figcaption></figure><p>Your next SNES game for today is&nbsp;<em>Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen'in Shūgō!</em>, a Japan-only dodgeball-themed spinoff of the&nbsp;<em>Kunio-kun</em>&nbsp;franchise (which is known as&nbsp;<em>River City&nbsp;</em>in the West).</p>
<p>As you've probably guessed, this will be the first time the game has been available in the West, although it will still be entirely in Japanese. Hopefully, you can still fire it up and enjoy a good old-fashioned game of dodgeball,&nbsp;<em>Kunio-kun&nbsp;</em>style.</p>
<p>Next, it's Namco's 1992 puzzler&nbsp;<em>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle</em>, a block-stacking puzzle game in which you must clear your screen of clutter. You might be familiar with this one as&nbsp;<em>Pac-Attack</em>, a reworked version of the game featuring Pac-Man that was released in the West the following year.</p>
<p>Finally, you're getting 1989 racer&nbsp;<em>Big Run</em>, an arcade racing game in which you can experience a very early video game version of the Paris-Dakar rally. Neat, right?</p>

<p>All four of these games are available right now for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, along with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-april-2024">wealth</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch">other titles</a> across the NES, the SNES, and the Game Boy. You can sign up for a Switch Online membership via your Switch console if you're interested.</p>

These can be found all throughout the map. But you can always find one in unmarked locations north of the Nitrodrome and south of Restored Reels. You can find another one west of The Raft, west of Mount Olympus, and southwest of Doom’s Courtyard. <strong>Look for the new gray hexagons when you drop in off the bus.</strong> After you open the chest, you’ll complete Stage 2 of the quest.</p><h2 id="h14183"><a id=""></a><strong>Stage 3</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="829259292b03c049e763c3963492ad74" data-recommend-id="image://829259292b03c049e763c3963492ad74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 3" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stage 3" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="829259292b03c049e763c3963492ad74" data-recommend-id="image://829259292b03c049e763c3963492ad74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 3" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here you’ll need to use Stark weapons and inflict a total of 500 damage.

These are Iron Man’s too, and if you use the machine inside, you’ll be given both gloves <em>and</em> boots at the same time.</p><p>What’s nice about this quest is that you can damage hostile AI, and it’ll count toward completion.</p><p>So once you have one of his weapons, head over to the<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-doom-fortnite-marvel-locations-guide-1851625368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-doom-fortnite-marvel-locations-guide-1851625368"> Marvel-themed areas</a></span> with a boss and kill some of the minions, and you’ll complete Stage 3 in no time.</p><h2 id="h14184"><a id=""></a><strong>Stage 4</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c2f640933c1af954c58a1c2d92447575" data-recommend-id="image://c2f640933c1af954c58a1c2d92447575" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 4" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stage 4" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c2f640933c1af954c58a1c2d92447575" data-recommend-id="image://c2f640933c1af954c58a1c2d92447575" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 4" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You must fly over Castle Doom using Iron Man’s Flight Kit to complete this part. His equipment spawns randomly, but you can increase your chances of finding the Flight Kit by looking in a Stark Chest—here it’s 50:50 if you’ll get the gloves or the boots, and it’s the boots you want. If you’re having a hard time finding a Stark chest, be sure to look at Stage 2 for directions on where you can obtain one.</p><p>Now that you have the Flight Kit, all you need to do is catch some air over Castle Doom, and you’ll be done with Stage 4. You’ll then hear a phone call between Jones and Hope talking about why they make such a good team.</p><h2 id="h14185"><a id=""></a><strong>Stage 5</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="cd5077cb93aac1a81148ffea53587f30" data-recommend-id="image://cd5077cb93aac1a81148ffea53587f30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stage 5" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd5077cb93aac1a81148ffea53587f30" data-recommend-id="image://cd5077cb93aac1a81148ffea53587f30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This stage is fairly simple to complete. All you need to do is use Iron Man’s Combat Kit or War Machine’s Arsenal and destroy a total of 25 objects. War Machines Arsenal can commonly be found in Avenger’s chests, which can be found in Restored Reels or Rebel’s Roost, and are far faster for completing this. However, Iron Man’s gloves are a <em>lot</em> more destructive.</p><h2 id="h14186"><a id=""></a><strong>Stage 6</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="dc3e2b7f61176853e7760c9a52117a43" data-recommend-id="image://dc3e2b7f61176853e7760c9a52117a43" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stage 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc3e2b7f61176853e7760c9a52117a43" data-recommend-id="image://dc3e2b7f61176853e7760c9a52117a43" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Stage 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The final part of the I Am Iron Man quest <strong>will require you to have both Iron Man-themed items, boots and gloves. </strong>Since chests will only give you one or the other, the best way to ensure you get both is to find one of those capsules mentioned in Stage 3.</p><p>Once you do, you’ll need to catch some air with his Flight Kit, and while in the area, use the Unibeam against a vehicle and inflict a total of 180 damage.</p><p>No one needs to be in the car for you to complete this quest. So, if you find a parked car, feel free to blow it up. Once you inflict the required damage, Jones will call Hope again, and they’ll talk about how they’re getting ready to fight Emma.</p><hr><p>Congratulations, you just completed another weekly story quest. Pretty soon, you’ll be taking on another boss and be one step closer to stopping Doom.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The PlayStation Vita exclusive Freedom Wars is receiving a remastered version due out on current platforms early next year.</p>
<p>Originally developed by Dimps and published by Sony in 2014, Bandai Namco will now publish a remastered port of the action game for Switch, PS5, PS5, and PC (Steam).</p>
<p>It's set to release on 10th January 2025. Below is a teaser trailer.</p>

<p>Freedom Wars is set in a distant dystopian future where the planet has been ravaged by pollution and humanity resides in city-sized prisons called Panopticons. In this anime world, just being alive is considered a sin.</p>
<p>Players explore the world and fight enemies using weapons called Thorns, allowing for fluid movement as well as subduing enemies. The game also features local and online multiplayer for both co-operative and competitive modes for up to eight players.</p>
<p>The remaster will feature several enhancements, including 4K resolution, upgraded textures, 60fps performance (on PlayStation and PC), an overhauled weapon crafting system, added difficulty settings and more.</p>

<p>Though previously released globally, Freedom Wars proved most popular in Japan where it achieved the second highest all-time opening sales for a Vita game.</p>
<p>The game received a mixed response, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/freedom-wars-review">Eurogamer's Freedom Wars review</a> was critical. "All it would take to save Freedom Wars is for it to get even one big thing right," it reads. "As it stands, combat is the brightest highlight, though it's still dulled by clumsy controls. Beyond that, the environments are so monotonous as to kill any passion for the thing. The plot has some strong ideas that never really pan out, so I can't recommend it for that either. In between those two bits of mediocrity lies hours of wandering around the same grey-brown hallways, grinding to cut your sentence down."</p>
<p>It's perhaps a bizarre choice for a remaster, then, some 11 years after its original release, but at least more people can give it a try.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-is-a-thing-for-some-reason.984342/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An ESRB listing has appeared for something called&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out what it might be.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listing</a>&nbsp;appears to confirm a remaster for the game will appear on PC and PlayStation 5 at some point in the future, although since it's just an ESRB listing and not an official PlayStation announcement, it doesn't reveal the extent or scope of the remaster.</p>
<p>This could just be a simple visual and performance overhaul for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-is-set-in-august">PC version</a> alongside a PS5 port, or it could be something more extensive and transformative (although since it's not a remake, we probably shouldn't expect the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date"><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>treatment</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb-tallneck.jpg?itok=vvbtTDL2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb-tallneck.jpg?itok=ysypGcLQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>appears to be getting the remaster treatment soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The ESRB's description for the game sure sounds like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, although I admit there are a few lines mentioned in warnings regarding "sexual material" and "fictional drugs" that I'd forgotten.</p>
<p>Apparently, a character in&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>makes a reference to "lounging around Elysium watching porn", which has slipped my mind, while others refer to being a "drug addict", meeting a "pusher" selling "Razorwing for eight bucks a tab", and "OD[ing] on Overcast".</p>
<p>Additionally, the word "shit" apparently appears in text and/or dialogue, so there's that.</p>
<p>Again, this being the ESRB, there's no mention of exactly what will be different in this remaster, but if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-remastered-recasts-peter-parkers-face-model">other recent Sony remasters</a> are anything to go by, we can likely expect some visual improvements, some quality-of-life tweaks, and perhaps some extra accessibility features as well.</p>

<p>It's also not clear whether owners of&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>on PC will get access to the remastered version for free, nor whether those who own the game on PS4 will be able to upgrade to PS5 at no extra cost.</p>
<p>We'll probably have to wait for Sony to announce something official before we know for sure. In the meantime, you can refresh your memory of the original&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review-merging-past-future-into-great-present">checking out our review</a> from way back in the mists of 2017.</p>

We talked to her about performing at a D&amp;D stage play, and her roots in improv comedy.</p>
<p>Felicia Day should be known by all in nerdy communities as the creator of Geek &amp; Sundry and <em>The Guild</em>. More recently <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e02e379b-4a69-4082-a688-3c8730b18a32" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d">Felicia Day has been getting involved in 3D Printing</a> and hosting multiple podcasts alongside regular acting roles for live-action and animated productions.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Twenty-Sided Tavern</em> is a D&amp;D stage play experience where the players are influenced by audience prompts as well as the outcomes of various audience-led minigames that they can partake in with their mobile phones. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="05539938-70ba-4cd6-98cf-b51345d15acc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/twenty-sided-tavern-is-bringing-interactivity-to-dd-stage-theater">Earlier this year we spoke with DM and Tavern Keeper of The Twenty-Sided Tavern, David Andrew Greener Law (DAGL) and Sarah Davis Reynolds, respectively</a>.</p>

<h2>The Perfect Blend Of D&amp;D, Improv, And Stage Acting</h2>
<p>To start our conversation I wanted to understand how Day got involved in this production. She laughed as she began to explain that she "wished it was more exciting but they called and I said Yes. I am so thrilled, I had actually been seeing advertisements and reviews on all of my socials and I vowed as soon as I could get to New York I would see the show because it looks so awesome and to get an email asking me to be the first guest star for the show was such an amazing honor and I couldn't have said yes fast enough."</p>
<p>At this point Day explained that she had yet to see the show in person, but she had been provided a recording of the show to get a better understanding of how it functioned. "Believe me I do my homework, I'm an A-student" Day confessed</p>
<p>"I will be seeing it multiple times before I go on the stage next Thursday," Day continued "we have a great rehearsal process and I can't wait to get on the stage, it's so beautiful!"</p>

<p>"As an actor, it's always been my dream to act in a play on Broadway and of course I have been very involved in the D&amp;D world from the very beginning of the broadcasting D&amp;D world and on top of that I've been doing improv for as long as I've been in Hollywood. <em>The Guild</em> actually came out of an improv class, two of the cast members were in my improv group and we still perform occasionally in Los Angeles together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is truly combining three things that I love more than anything in once beautiful package"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in our discussion Day spoke about the different material she has access to in the lead up to her role in The Twenty-Sided Tavern but reinforced that what she's been working on the most has been improv. "The wonder thing is that I can come and do the show without weeks and weeks of rehearsal because we're making it up, there's a lot of structure, audience interaction, and technical stuff going on but it's one of those things that it's going to be a lot of on the job training"</p>
<h2>The Role Of A Lifetime</h2>
<p>The way that The Twenty-Sided Tavern functions is that at the start of each performance the party is selected. Each archetypal character – Rogue, Warrior, Wizard, etc – has a number of different permutations that can be selected.</p>
<p>The role that Felicia Day is playing is the Mage.</p>
<p>"The character of the Mage depends on the audience, the wonderful thing about Twenty-Sided Tavern is that the audience is completely involved the whole time with what's going on on-stage. The audience gets to choose what character I play, they get an option between three different characters,"&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-audience-selections.jpg?itok=Qt_XeJvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-audience-selections.jpg?itok=p06RWA79 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The audience selecting which character they want to see for a night</figcaption></figure><p>Day continued to describe the many ways the Audience gets to participate "there are all these points at which the audience helps me win a battle, or chooses the approach that we take as a party and it's so fun and so amazing, I can't wait to be live in the audience and then I can't wait to be on the stage after that."</p>
<p>Asking how involved she was in building out the skeleton of the three different mage characters Day explained to me that where she'll really be involved in is fleshing that character out past their selection. "The archetypes are there but of course my interpretation of a Gnome Mage is going to be very different from Aabria (Iyengar) or Erika (Ishii's) Gnome Mage so the wonderful thing about improv is that it's unique to the performer."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every scenario is going to be different every night, every character is going to be different every night, heck, my Gnome Mage is probably going to be different every night"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn't resist asking whether there was any chance of a cameo appearance from Codex, Day's character from <em>The Guild</em>. "You know, I don't think Codex will be appearing on this stage but I am working on a Guild musical, we're going to be doing a stage reading of that very soon so you will see Codex on a stage, probably in 2025"</p>
<p>Felicia Day's run at The Twenty-Sided Tavern begins on the 19th of September and will last until the 24th. At the time of writing there is only one showing left for Felicia Day's run, but if you're a fan of TTRPG actual plays like Dimension 20 Aabria Iyengar will be special guesting from September 26th - October 7th and Erika Ishii will be joining the Tavern from December 5th - December 17th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Wooting created the best gaming keyboard on the market two years ago with the 60HE. It popularized the use of Hall effect switches and a <a href="https://wooting.io/rapid-trigger">Rapid Trigger</a> system that speeds up how quickly you can activate a key, making it ideal for PC gaming. Now, Wooting has created <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he/wooting-80he">the 80HE</a> — an 80 percent keyboard that makes the best gaming keyboard even better.</p><p>While I’m a fan of 60 percent keyboards for gaming, I miss having a delete key, a print screen button, and even dedicated arrow keys and an F-row. The 80HE adds all of these keys inside a package that really doesn’t feel <em>that </em>much larger than the 60HE. It’s essentially two keys wider and an F-row of keys taller. The extra keys certainly make it more comfortable for regular typing and a lot more convenient than having to mod keys or use function key shortcuts.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="59WVjK" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">Wooting 80HE</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->200</span></p><p>Wooting’s 80HE is the company’s latest Hall effect keyboard, following the popular 60HE. It has a bigger 80 percent layout, a new light bar, 8kHz polling, and more.</p></div><p>Wooting has also switched up the housing for its 80HE, moving to a gasket mount instead of the tray mount on the 60HE. The silicone gasket mount holds together the board and the switch plate. It does a great job of reducing the noise, making the typing experience a little softer than on the 60HE. You can also adjust the case angle to 2.8 degrees, 7.5 degrees, or 10 degrees thanks to a variety of silicone feet included in the box.</p><p>I’ve been trying out both the $109.99 zinc alloy case and the $34.99 PCR ABS plastic case for the 80HE over the past week, and I personally prefer the zinc material. It’s the pricier option of the two, but you get a hefty case that helps produce the kind of <em>thock</em> sound I enjoy on keyboards. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Wooting 80HE (top) versus the 60HE (bottom).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I found the plastic case a little fiddly to open when I was building a bare-bones module version of the 80HE thanks to the clips holding it in place. The zinc option slid apart a lot more easily, though. You’ll have to be careful if you do take the 80HE apart or build one yourself, as there is a JST cable that needs to be disconnected when you remove the board from the case.</p><p>The sound on the 80HE is also improved over the 60HE thanks to updated Hall effect switches. Wooting’s Lekker V2 switches now wobble less and sound better than the original V1 switches. The differences are subtle, but I always disliked the key wobble on the 60HE default switches, so I’m happy to see that improved.</p><p>The Lekker switches are hot-swappable, so you can swap them out if they break or replace them with any Hall effect switches. Wooting lets you pick between the Lekker L45 and L60, with both feeling like linear switches and the L60s having a little more key start and end force. Wooting also uses screw-in stabilizers to eliminate rattle on the 80HE, and these are also replaceable with most other third-party screw-in and clip-in stabilizers.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can easily swap the switches and cases on an 80HE.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The real magic of Wooting’s keyboards is made possible by these Hall effect switches, which use a magnet so the board can track how far a switch has been pressed. Most Cherry MX-style switches that are commonly used on mechanical keyboards use a copper mechanism to register a press with a board at a set actuation point of around 2mm. On the 80HE, you can adjust the actuation point on individual keys all the way down to 0.1mm. </p><p>The improved Wootility software allows you to enable adjustable actuation points, Rapid Trigger, and more advanced key functionality. Rapid Trigger changes the actuation and reset point of keys on the fly so that keys will activate the moment you press down and deactivate instantly when you release them. You can then repeat a key press in the middle of a motion, without needing to surpass the actuation point.</p><p>Rapid Trigger is ideal for PC gaming because of the fast deactivation that lets you move around quickly and repeat key presses faster. Keyboard manufacturers like SteelSeries, Keychron, and others have copied the Rapid Trigger feature after adopting Hall effect switches, and it has become a popular feature among <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em> players.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The LED bar can be used for key indicators and much more.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The other big addition to the 80HE is a new LED bar that sits above the arrow keys. Wooting says it’s designed to communicate with you and can tell you which profile you have active on the board or how much RAM or CPU your system is using. You can also just use it for fun RGB effects to match your keys or the rest of your setup. You can configure the LED bar in Wooting’s updated Wootility software. </p><p>One great feature of Wooting keyboards is that they store your profile on the board itself. You configure it in the Wootility web app, and there’s no need to install an app or have anything running in the background on your PC. Wooting is breaking from that tradition somewhat with the 80HE, though. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The light bar can animate during a firmware update.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>If you want RAM or CPU monitoring on the LED bar, you’ll need a new background app, which is coming soon. I haven’t been able to test this yet, but Wooting says it will only be required for the more advanced LED bar functionality. I’ve been using the LED bar as a profile indicator, which is super useful for swapping between gaming and typing profiles.</p><p>If you update the firmware on the 80HE, the LED bar fills up to show the progress, a neat little touch that hints at what will be possible with this new addition. Right now, you can get it to indicate the profile you’re using, when keys are pressed, or to let you know when the CAPS lock key is enabled. It will also be able to show your system volume once the background service is available.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Wooting stores all of your keyboard settings on the 80HE module itself.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The 80HE also supports up to 8kHz USB polling, but no wireless connectivity. While many keyboards promise 8kHz polling, the 80HE also scans every analog key position at that same rate. This faster polling rate also lowers the 80HE latency to just 0.125ms.</p><p>While I appreciate the improvements on the 80HE, the layout means the only options for cases right now are from Wooting directly. I’d expect to see third-party options over time, but until then, you’re stuck with black, ghost, and frost options for the plastic case or black, white, and raw options for the zinc case. </p><p>The 80HE — as a complete keyboard with a plastic case, switches, and keycaps — <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">starts at $199.99</a>. If you upgrade to the zinc alloy case, prices start at $289.99. You can also buy the standalone 80HE module without switches and keycaps for $154.99, but you’ll need a $34.99 plastic case or a $109.99 zinc alloy one.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989237/keychron-q1-he-hall-effect-analog-switches-price-release-date-specs-features-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23823001/corsair-k70-max-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features-switches">Corsair</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/22/23178213/steelseries-apex-pro-mini-wireless-mechanical-keyboards-hall-effect-omnipoint">SteelSeries</a>, and many others offer similar boards with Hall effect switches, but none quite offer the combination of hardware and software that Wooting delivers. If you’ve always been tempted by the 60HE but wanted more keys, the 80HE delivers that and much more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As I’m sure as is the curse of anyone who’s watched the entirety of Peep Show multiple times, I cannot read the name ‘Marko’ without hearing it in a nasally Australian accent, inquiring about cocaine. This is probably a disservice to the hero of colourful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marko-beyond-brave">Marko: Beyond Brave</a>, who a quick goog tells me may be based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Marko#Epic_poetry_of_Bulgaria_and_North_Macedonia">Krali Marko</a> - a popular character in the folklore of Studio Mechka’s native Bulgaria. Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.</p>

<p>“Entropy has escaped its prison and threatens to engulf the world. Step into the shoes of Marko, a young warrior who uncovers a secret power hidden within,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186470/Marko_Beyond_Brave/">Steam page</a>. “Brave the ancient evils, battle mythical creatures and forge powerful alliances to restore the balance. With elemental powers at your command and every decision shaping the world's fate, embark on a thrilling adventure where courage is your greatest weapon.” I particularly enjoy this last point, given that Marko’s greatest weapon is clearly a comically large sword. </p>
<p>Massive sword aside, here are some more features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Traditional 2D art: The land of Zagora is brought to life in great detail, drawn, and animated entirely by hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenging, but fair gameplay: Tight, responsive controls. Jump, fight, and dash your way across challenges. Battle mighty foes and slay ancient evils.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the vast land of Zagora: a huge non-linear map with hundreds of rooms. Solve puzzles and find hidden treasures, all within the Slavic-inspired fairytale setting.</p></li>
<li><p>Encounter mysterious characters: A cast of cute and creepy friends and foes, all brought to life with traditional 2D frame-by-frame animation.</p></li>
<li><p>Master New Abilities: Discover new skills, allowing you to go toe to toe with the most brutal of enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>Discover all secrets: Delve deep into the world and discover hidden areas and unspeakable treasures. Collect all the pieces and puzzle together an ancient mystery.</p></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I’m definitely drawn in by the art in this one, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>  meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols </a>hoppy-slashy certainly doesn’t hurt - specifically, the press release calls it a "Slavic Silksong". A few of the currently slim number of Steam reviews are reporting technical issues, however - so might be worth holding out until they’re sorted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He tried to juxtapose it with modern games that are either live service hamster wheels or single-player experiences that feel narratively convoluted and full of bloated gameplay systems. </p><p>But he also talked about the game oozing “with so much masculinity that I feel like I’ve been in a desert for the last few years” and how it has “themes nobody wants to go near anymore [like] ‘for courage and honor, for brotherhood, for the emperor.’” LegendaryDrops went on to praise the limited banter among the characters, calling out games that eschew simple good and evil characters and more stoic dialogue. </p><p>The video didn’t blow up until a few days later when YouTuber Asmongold <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/hBUqCUZ0swE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/hBUqCUZ0swE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a nearly hour-long reaction to it</a></span>, agreeing with most of LegendaryDrops’ points and elaborating on some of them. “The problem is not that [modern games] have complex characters, the problem is that their idea of a complex character is a self-indulgent loser that doesn’t have any charisma,” he said at one point. </p><p>He continued: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>That’s the reason why I remember I had to read <em>The</em> <em>Catcher in the Rye,</em> and I hated that book so much. And I feel like the reason why I hated the book is because I thought the main character like Holden Caulfield  or whatever was the biggest simp loser pussy bitch that I had ever, like just such a loser...I bet the people that fucking write stuff like fucking<em> Dustborn</em> or whatever they love that, they think it’s great.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a two-step that happens in both assessments of <em>Space Marine 2</em>. Each argument conflates modern gaming trends that many players find exhausting with a  more recent and boutique reactionary backlash against games accused of shoehorning progressive values into their narratives. These accusations are made whenever a title dares to showcase diverse characters or tell a story that doesn’t solely revolve around the straight white male that’s traditionally centered in video game box art. </p><p>Asmongold bringing up <em>Dustborn, </em>a recent action-adventure indie release about a band traveling across America, is specifically a reference to that. The game and the team behind it became such a target of “anti-woke” reactionaries online that the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dustborn-red-thread-games-harassment-abuse-review-woke-1851636977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dustborn-red-thread-games-harassment-abuse-review-woke-1851636977">had to put out a statement</a></span>. Rather than just disagreeing with the values expressed in the game, it became important for some to show that the game had financially failed and was bad <em>because</em> of those values, the same way some are now championing <em>Space Marine 2</em> not just because it’s a fun or well-designed game, but in part claiming that it’s fun and well designed <em>because</em> it centers young men as the target demographic. </p><p>None of this would have particularly surprised anyone if it wasn’t for Saber Interactive’s own CEO appearing to join in the debate. Matt Karch, who co-founded the company in 2021, appeared to leave a comment on Asmongold’s reaction video near the end of last week. “Hey man,” it began. “CEO of Saber here.  I love your videos.  When we signed the deal to make <em>Space Marine 2</em>, all I wanted was a throwback game.  We had the chance to work on something which by its nature was ‘old school.’ I can’t even comprehend many of the current games that we play these days.  They are too complex and too much of an investment.”</p><p>The comment continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We worked on Halo back in the day, and that game could be distilled down to the simplest of shooting loops, but it was entirely addicting. That is what we wanted to recapture.  I hope that games like <em>Space Marine 2 </em>and <em>Wukong</em> are the start of a reversion to a time when games were simply about fun and immersion.  I spent some time as Chief Operating Officer at Embracer and I saw games there that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers.  We just want to do some glory kills and get the heart rate up a little.  For me that is what games should be about.</p></blockquote><p>It wasn’t until Monday, September 16, when a <em>Space Marine 2</em> news account on Twitter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SpaceMarineALT/status/1835701490511384643&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SpaceMarineALT/status/1835701490511384643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recirculated that comment</a></span> that more people became aware of it. Those in the comment section instantly flocked to it, flooding it with upvotes and positive responses fluctuating between things like “you are doing god’s work” and “I‘m glad we got games failing hard that have pronouns in them, like who tf plays these DEI games?”</p><p>A lot of people probably just thought, “Yeah, <em>Space Marine 2</em> rules, I miss couch co-op and not grinding battle passes.” But for a contingent of the anti-woke gaming backlash, it vindicated the idea that at least one of the scourges of modern gaming is “overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers.” All of this might have been easy to shrug off it not for a highly motivated and ongoing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428">harassment campaign</a></span> against story consultants who, earlier this year, became the boogiemen responsible for every person of color and pride flag that showed up in a major game. </p><p>The YouTube account behind the comment had no uploaded videos and was only created in May of this year. The bio read “CEO of Saber Interactive.  Generic male of sorts - lover of loud guitars, violent games, fast cars and all sorts of whisky.” When asked to confirm if the comment really belonged to Karch, a spokesperson for Saber Interactive declined. “Saber is not commenting on this matter,” they told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. </p><p>So far, 2024 has been full of breakout action games that have eschewed some of the excesses associated with open-world RPGs and grindy multiplayer games in favor of more streamlined and “old-school” feeling designs, and some (though not all) have been dragged into a culture war that seems to not so secretly be about entirely different things. <em>Stellar Blade</em> was a sci-fi Souls-lite that became mired in controversy around sexy costume censorship. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> was a fantasy action game in the mold of <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>that became a breeding ground for fake conspiracies around nonexistent attempts to get the game canceled. And now<em> Space Marine 2</em>, a straightforward shooter campaign with crunchy combat and dazzling set pieces, has become the latest Rorschach test for what ails modern blockbuster gaming. </p><p>There’s extra irony in a <em>Warhammer 40K</em> game becoming that crucible, given its openly fascist world-building and the fact that the owners of it have had to repeatedly remind the more toxic corners of its fanbase that “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/11/19/the-imperium-is-driven-by-hate-warhammer-is-not/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/11/19/the-imperium-is-driven-by-hate-warhammer-is-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer</em> is for everyone</a></span>.” To the degree that <em>Space Marine 2</em> doesn’t “impose” morals on the player, it’s only because the politics of its universe are so obviously bleak and abhorrent that regular people know to treat them as grim dark fantasy rather than a hero’s journey parable for 21st century virtue ethics. </p><p>There’s another hit game that’s recently bucked modern blockbuster gaming trends, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-sony-concord-ps5-pro-1851648360?rev=1726405020058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-sony-concord-ps5-pro-1851648360?rev=1726405020058">and it’s <em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>. There are no daily quests, crafting systems, or XP grind in that either, just a crisp and highly refined mashup of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> collectathon platforming. Weirdly, no one seems to be obsessed with whether the cute little robot at the center of the game is a paragon of masculinity or secretly a vehicle for transmitting woke propaganda. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-co-founder-dreamhaven-lynked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2020, Dreamhaven was unveiled by Mike Morhaine, the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment. Today, the somewhat mysterious company has more than 100 staff members, and it’s preparing to lift the lid on its first internally developed game. </p>



<p>In the meantime, it has been revealed that the firm is publishing Lynked: Banner of the Spark, which was recently showcased during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dawn-of-dreamhaven">Dawn of Dreamhaven</h2>



<p>Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier just revealed that Mike Morhaime’s Dreamhaven is the publisher behind Lynked: Banner of the Spark, an all-new cooperative action title with city-building elements and colourful combat sequences.</p>



<p>In 1991, Morhaime co-founded Blizzard Entertainment, and speaking to Bloomberg, the man himself was transparent about a comparison between Blizzard and Dreamhaven:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When we started Blizzard, we really had no idea what we were doing. This is a much more experienced leadership team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Next month, Dreamhaven will unveil a new game developed by Secret Door, a studio headed up by another Blizzard veteran – Chris Sigaty. Previously, Sigaty worked as the executive producer on StarCraft II. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-18/blizzard-co-founder-s-new-company-dreamhaven-aims-to-recreate-the-old-magic?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Per Bloomberg’s report</a>, Dreamhaven has been open about the struggles it has faced since it was founded. The last four years have been critical for the games industry, thanks to COVID-19 and the ongoing financial woes plaguing the wider market. Because of these issues, Secret Door’s title missed internal deadlines.</p>



<p>It was noted by Sigaty that Secret Door’s first game, produced with the backing of Dreamhaven, should be out next year, but a relatively small team and tighter budgets may cause further alterations to that timeline.</p>



<p>In a quote about the future of Dreamhaven’s titles, Morhaime said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The size of these games probably are not going to be the size of a Blizzard game. But the quality bar we’re trying to hit is still there. We’re trying to still put out high-quality, polished games that people can love and enjoy and share with their friends.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FREEDOM WARS REMASTERED — Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>This remaster includes improved visuals, with 4K resolution and 60fps, as well as adjusted game balance and difficulty options. The weapon crafting and upgrading systems will also be getting updates.</p><p>Freedom Wars was released for the PS Vita in 2015, developed by Japan Studio and published by Sony. Its online servers were shut down in December 2021. Dimps senior vice president <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/09/18/20240918-freedomwars/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Takashi Tsukamoto said</a> that while Freedom Wars Remastered will not have cross-play with different platforms, online play will be available. PS4 and PS5 players, however, can play with each other and share online rankings.</p><p>The original Vita version of Freedom Wars only had Japanese audio, but Tsukamoto also confirmed that the remaster will feature English audio.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-16-and-rebirth-did-not-meet-our-expectations-square-enix-says.984279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that profits from&nbsp;tentpole releases&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, which launched last year and earlier this year respectively,&nbsp;"did not meet [its] expectations".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/pdf/24q4outline.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results outline released earlier today</a> (but pertaining to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">presentation from May of this year</a>), Square Enix simply says that profits from both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rebirth&nbsp;</em>didn't meet expectations, but CEO Takashi Kiryu doesn't go into any further detail.</p>
<p>He does, however, say later in the outline that Square Enix plans to "establish a development footprint" aimed at "consistently and regularly releasing titles that beat our customers' expectations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=1V0n8UmT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=u9nVpcTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>didn't meet expectations, according to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>This being a relatively public-facing presentation and outline, Square Enix doesn't state exactly what its expectations were for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, so it's hard to say exactly by how much the two games missed the mark.</p>
<p>The company hasn't publicly disclosed sales for&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, but back in September last year, Square Enix said that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-expectations-square-enix">were in line with its expectations</a>&nbsp;(a statement issued the month before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceos-reported-statement-on-final-fantasy-xvi-sales-is-widely-misinterpreted">having apparently been widely misinterpreted</a>).</p>
<p>We also know that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>shipments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-shipments">topped three million</a> within the game's first week on sale, so whatever Square Enix's expectations were for the game, they must be pretty high.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that Square Enix doesn't say the two games weren't profitable; not meeting expectations isn't the same as not making a profit, so it's entirely possible that while both games made money for Square Enix, they simply didn't make enough.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=ZLwHWNGn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=Ll1rTFOQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s sales were also disappointing, according to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, either. In the presentation, Kiryu admits that&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, Square Enix's entry into the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>-style family-friendly shooter market, didn't perform quite as well as expected, which is probably why <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-free-to-play-october">the game is going free-to-play</a>.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this outline pertains to a presentation from a few months ago, but the document was made public today. As such, this doesn't necessarily reflect Square Enix's current standing;&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-requirements-demo">since launched on PC</a>, although<i>&nbsp;Rebirth&nbsp;</i>remains a PS5 exclusive, at least for now.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of impact this has on Square Enix's strategy when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The prototype designs for the Nintendo Switch 2 have seemingly leaked online. First appearing on Chinese social media before making <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">their way to Reddit</a>, the images give a look at what could be the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor.</p>



<p>Based on the leaked design, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a larger screen, new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magnetic Joy-Cons</a>, and multiple USB-C ports. It’s general look will remain similar to the original Switch. It will also carry over the back stand design from the Switch OLED model compared to the small kickstand look of the base Switch.</p>



<p>With the aforementioned Joy-Cons, the images show that the way the attach will be different than the original. It also seems to support the earlier rumors of addition buttons on the back of each controller.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-nintendo-switch-2-specs">What About Nintendo Switch 2 Specs?</h2>



<p>In addition to the general design, some specs of the Nintendo Switch 2 have also allegedly been leaked. The Switch 2 will featured 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The system supporting HDMI 2.1 seems to back up earlier claims that the console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support 4K resolution</a> in some capacity.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Insider Gaming has not been able to independently verify the legitimacy of the Nintendo Switch 2 design images. Until we can, or something is made official, <strong>the images and reported specs should still be taken with a grain of salt</strong>.</p>



<p>Nintendo has yet to respond to requests for comment on the design leak. It’s unlikely they will, however. They are expected to reveal the console sometime later this year with a 2025 launch. If you want to see the images of the leaked design, you can do so below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What next for Final Fantasy?</h2></div><section><p>Square Enix has finally made public its dissatisfaction with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>’s commercial performance, admitting neither game met profit expectations.</p><p>In a financial results briefing held May 13 but only released today, September 18, Takashi Kiryu, president and representative director of Square Enix said: "In the HD Games sub-segment, we released multiple new titles, including major titles such as Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but profits unfortunately did not meet our expectations."</p><p>Kiryu went on to suggest Square Enix cannibalized sales of its Final Fantasy games released during the financial year ending March 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Final Fantasy XVI Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide Game Awards 2023 Trailer Gallery</h3></div></output><p>“We recognize that issues remain in the Digital Entertainment segment,” Kiryu admitted. “The HD Games sub-segment failed to better its profitability, posting operating losses in every year of our previous medium-term plan. In addition to this, we did not manage our title portfolio across the company as well as we could have, which I believe resulted in opportunity losses due to cannibalization between our own titles."</p><p>Square Enix released Final Fantasy 16 in June 2023, then Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth just over half a year later in February 2024. Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-responds-to-final-fantasy-16-sales-concern-points-to-ps5-install-base">Square Enix <em>has</em> announced a sales figure for Final Fantasy 16</a>, it has yet to do so for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second game in the company’s trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-a-multiplatform-strategy-after-profits-tumble">The company has already announced a significant rework of its business</a> as it fights for profitability. It has a new multi-platform plan that encompasses PC and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-to-double-down-on-xbox-releases-final-fantasy-14-producer-says">potentially Xbox</a> and the next Nintendo console (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-pc-global-release-times-confirmed">Final Fantasy 16 launched on PC this week</a>). But it has also canceled a number of games, and, Kiryu revealed, taken steps to better curate its pipeline of games.</p><p>“In the case of the HD Game sub-segment, sales of individual games will remain the key variable, but we believe that we will be able to exercise some degree of control over that volatility by carefully curating our pipeline over the next three years,” Kiryu said. “By also working steadily to improve our profitability, we intend to offset the weakness in SD games to achieve overall profitability.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We did not manage our title portfolio across the company as well as we could have.</p></div><p>Square Enix has now extended the timelines for a portion of its pipeline, “in part because of the massive amount of time required to develop HD games, and in part because we determined that we should rethink how best to deliver some of the titles we had under development to our customers,” Kiryu revealed.</p><p>Final Fantasy isn’t the only Square Enix series struggling. Its Splatoon-style game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a> also flopped and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-makes-playstation-splatoon-shooter-foamstars-free-to-play-8-months-after-launch">has since gone free-to-play</a>.</p><p>So, what’s next for Square Enix? Square Enix has <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate"><u>Dragon Quest 12</u></a> in the works. In January, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-it-may-be-time-for-the-younger-generation-to-handle-final-fantasy-17"><u>it might be time for a younger generation to lead the franchise and helm Final Fantasy 17</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
