			<p>Graphics modder NiceGuy has just updated his<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-and-complete-rt-shaders-get-major-updates-with-sky-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Complete RT</a> ReShade shader to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/complete-rt-1-6-118832379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 1.6</a>, claiming many improvements, such as up to three times faster performance.&nbsp;As shown in the video, running the Global Illumination mode at native resolution (100% on the slider) takes just 4ms versus the 13.5 ms of the previous Complete RT 1.5. This translates into much higher frame rates (71 FPS versus 49 FPS). Of course, this may vary depending on the game and the scene.</p>
<p>There's more, as the internal upscaler has received several updates. CompleteRT is now capable of dynamically adjusting the Global Illumination resolution with floating-point scales from 33% to 100%, and it can even automatically match the rendering resolution when using all the industry-standard upscalers from NVIDIA (DLSS), AMD (FSR), Intel XeSS, and even Epic's own Unreal Engine TSR. Additionally, this reportedly helps with performance, reduces flickering, and improves overall quality.</p>
<p>Complete RT's implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nvrtx-branch-has-been-updated-with-experimental-restir-gi-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> was also enhanced. NiceGuy says both performance and quality have received an upgrade, and the accuracy is now close to the ground truth image. Lastly, the new shader has better specular reflections, too, thanks to a fix for the flickering that used to appear when using low roughness values. The precision of the reflections and their performance was also improved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Complete RT 1.6 | Teaser Update: 3x faster RAY TRACING! better Upscaling &amp; ReSTIR GI, new NiceHancer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9gEk1j_j6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NiceGuy also announced a brand new shader called eLITE RT. This is meant to be a much lighter screen space ray traced GI shader that could potentially run even on low-end or handheld hardware. The modder says he spent months of research and development on this project, essentially swapping priorities compared to Complete RT. While the latter focuses on quality while still targeting solid performance, eLITE RT focuses on performance while trying to achieve good quality.</p>
<p>Both shaders are only available to his Patreon subscribers. While Complete RT is unlocked on the second tier, which costs $6 monthly, the new eLITE RT is currently only available for subscribers of the third tier, priced at $11.50 monthly. That's because it is still in beta and requires more testing and feedback; it will eventually be moved to the same tier of Complete RT once it's ready.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access.1071168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 has six classes available, with another six coming as the game progresses. There will be 12 classes and 36 ascendancies in due time, making it a genuinely expansive game with countless hours of playtime available. But for now, you’re limited to a few starting classes. Here’s the thing, though. They rock! At least in our opinion. </p>



<p>So we decided to rank them all with a Path of Exile 2 class tier list for Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-s-best-classes-ranked-this-is-totally-our-opinion">Path of Exile 2’s Best Classes Ranked (This is Totally Our Opinion!)</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Yes, you will have your own tier list, and we’d love to hear which classes you place in S-Tier in the comments below. Do you disagree with us? Let us know! We love discussing our favorite games, especially when you bring them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-classes">S-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>The <strong>Mercenary </strong>is the big new class available in Path of Exile 2, and after playing through the entire campaign with one, I can attest to its strength. You can turn the crossbow into a close-quarters shotgun and lob grenades with reckless abandon. It’s a fun, powerful class capable of downing most bosses in the game.</p>



<p>Following that, we have the <strong>Witch </strong>with its powerful summons and the <strong>Monk </strong>with its creative abilities and fast, hard-hitting martial arts capable of making quick work of most enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mercenary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-classes">A-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>You can solo the entirety of Path of Exile 2 with the <strong>Ranger</strong>, so long as you have the proper equipment. A powerful bow will take you far. As for the <strong>Sorceress</strong>, the right build and an occasional helping hand in defeating some of the more challenging bosses in the game, which you can ask for in the global chat, push both classes into A-Tier.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ranger</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong></li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-b-tier-classes">B-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>From firsthand experience, the <strong>Warrior</strong> has the potential to be potent against mobs and ranged bosses, but it’s a slow class to start with. If you have the patience to stick with the brute force of a club-wielding monster, you’ll find a powerful class capable of tanking enemies, but one that excels with a group, like a Sorceress or Ranger.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>No matter when you dive into Path of Exile 2, chances are you want to know about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-become-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game going free-to-play</a>, right? Then, you can finally convince your friends to play!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The biggest Nintendo Switch games arriving in 2025 are sure to occupy your free time, and we’ve handpicked the best exclusives and some interesting third-party titles to look out for.</p>



<p>My Nintendo Switch hasn’t seen as much action in 2024—dare I say, it’s gathered a bit of dust. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Peach Showtime</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> haven’t scratched the itch, and there seems to be a bigger emphasis on remakes and remasters. Talk of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> continues to intensify, and it feels like a necessary step to bring more impressive exclusives and power-sapping third-party games.</p>



<p>2025 is ignoring this notion for now though, because it has some juicy Nintendo Switch games lined up. Forgotten sequels and big franchise sequels are also lined up, so let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025">Nintendo Switch Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Nintendo Directs and other presentations are almost certain to deliver shock announcements. Expect surprises and shadow drops throughout 2025, but for now, these games we know are pretty much locked in for 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Darn those Space Pirates. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A torrid development period stunted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>‘s progress. With the success of Metroid Prime Remastered in the distance now, the Nintendo community is clamoring for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Its reintroduction and long-awaited gameplay debut in 2024 reminded everyone why it’s so hyped. Samus is back with her trusty weapons, battling more Metroids and Space Pirates, all to another funky soundtrack. This could be Nintendo’s biggest ace up its sleeve, so here’s hoping it meets its announced 2025 release window.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Pokémon is the gift that keeps giving. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is the follow-up to 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and it seems to be an entirely new story. The island of Hokkaido is replaced by a more populated and livelier Lumiose City. A single trailer is all we have, and even though it’s quite vague—we’re interested. I love Arceus, and it’s mostly what I’m looking for in a modern Pokémon game. But its sometimes empty and barren world—and lack of Trainer battles—left a gaping hole. Here’s hoping Pokemon Legends: Z-A can deliver, and bring an improved performance compared to the technical mishaps of Scarlet and Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzle galore. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> makes many of our fun 2025 lists—because Donkey Kong is fun. So much so, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a simple remaster, adding new content, but keeping the authentic feel of the Wii original. You’re assured of platforming paradise with more than a hint of a challenge. We’re ready for its bongo beats and banana stylings and it’s one of the first major games to hit the Switch in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A whole world to see. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles has been a tremendously successful franchise for Nintendo. So much so spin-offs have sprouted from the main franchise, and the Wiiu was treated to Xenoblade Chronicles X in 2015. Like Donkey Kong: Country Returns—and countless other Wii and WiiU games, Nintendo has wanted to bring X to the Switch and is finally doing so with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. It’s an intense, JRPG encouraging you to explore its vast world, do important work for the BLADE organization, and fight waves of human enemies and titanic wild foes.</p>



<h3 id="h-civilization-7">Civilization 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not partial to Civ games—or strategy titles in general—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is a massive third-party entry on this list, with the series <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-civilization-series-has-sold-33-million-copies-since-it-debuted-in-1991#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20there%20have%20been%2066%20versions%20of,were%20copies%20of%20Civilization%205%20plus%20the%20expansions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">estimated to have sold well over 30 million copies</a>. The traditional fare of world-building through different periods of human history is all here. You’re posed with events and decisions guaranteed to affect your world’s version of reality and history, and it’s important your thinking cap is on when deciding the fate of the human race!</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Another round of horror awaits. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Little Nightmares saga is not for the faint-hearted. It inspires a new type of unsettling horror that low-budget jumpscare titles can only dream of. Little Nightmares features a new story, fresh, poor unwitting children, and the acclaimed addition of co-op. The second character can be computer-controlled, or you can invite a friend along to lap up the terror with you. It’s an IP going from strength to strength, and I’m expecting bad dreams to abound as a direct result of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m hopeful of a Nintendo Switch 2 announcement in 2025, and if it happens, what games do you want to see? A new 3D Mario game? The next Zelda? Let us know your gaming desires.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>Lucasfilm</span><span>|</span><span><p>Harrison Ford (L), cinematographer Douglas Slocombe (C) and director Steven Spielberg (R) on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>There are loads of great things about <em>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</em>, loads of very immersive<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and funny things</a>, but one&nbsp; thing you notice before anything else—and this is obvious even from watching trailers, let alone playing the game is that it's visually breath-taking. I don't want to take anything away from the amazing animators and modellers and concept artists who worked on it, the whole game looks incredible, but for this blog in particular I wanted to talk about how <em>Great Circle</em> (and particularly its many, many cutscenes) has been framed and lit.</p><p>There are moments playing and watching this game when I've simply taken my hands off the keyboard and mouse and gasped. So many moments when what I'm seeing on the screen looks cinematic not in the over-used video game sense of the word, but in actual motion picture sense of the word.</p><p>There are of course good reasons for this! <em>Great Circle</em> is, if nothing else, a painstaking labour of love from a team who knows exactly what makes <em>Indiana Jones</em> tick. It's an adaptation that hasn't just slapped a license on a generic experience, it's been designed from the ground up to make you feel like you're spending hours in Dr. Jones' shoes. The game's music is the music you remember from the films, Troy Baker's voice acting is perfect and even stuff like the animation is a work of reverence, nailing Harrison Ford's mannerisms down to the most minute detail, from his smirks to his finger-wagging.</p><p>That love can also be found in the game's eye for the cinematic. Watching <em>Great Circle</em>--the framing, the colours, the lighting, the emphasis--looks just like watching an actual <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie, or at least it looks like watching the first three films, which all featured the cinematography of Douglas Slocombe, a legend in the field who was nominated for three Academy Awards across a career that saw him work on everything from <em>The Italian Job</em> to <em>Rollerball </em>to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> to <em>Close Encounters Of The Third Kind</em>.</p><p>It's the latter where Slocombe first met Steven Spielberg, and the director was so impressed that he brought Slocombe on to work on 1981's <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, a film that Spielberg thought he had very specific noir-like ideas for, but whose look ultimately gave way to something else when running into Slocombe's penchant for practical considerations and high contrast shooting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Beauty Of Indiana Jones" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zZaIvckiqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Spielberg recalled this transition in 2017,<a href="https://theasc.com/articles/flashback-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-directing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in a feature he wrote for American Cinematographer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I originally wanted a much moodier, almost neo-Brechtian style of light and shadow for this film. I wanted the film to resemble more, say The Informer — the film being more film noir than I eventually accomplished. But I found that the movie was beginning to paint itself out of the corner I put it in, by the kind of sketchy brightness which is Dougie's forte and I began to see what Dougie was doing. He was giving it a fuller look, not a flat look; he was giving it a very nice backlit look, but a very full backlit look and because of that he was getting amazing depth of field due to the number of lights he was using. In the dailies, of course, it looks very dark and moody and atmospheric, while on the set it looked very bright, but he was not shooting wide open, to say the least. He was stopping down. So between my original discussions with Dougie about film noir and subsequent results from our collaboration, and seeing a couple of days' dailies that looked kind of sketchy — very sketchy — perhaps film noir, and then seeing other scenes that were fatter and richer in contrast, I began to say, "Hey, this movie is much prettier in color than it is in black-and-white."</p><p>I believe that the photographic style of this movie happened by itself through an interesting compromise between what Dougie loves to do and what I wanted from him. We each came halfway and we found what will now be, hopefully, the continuing style of the Raiders saga.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The result was a trilogy with a visual style so distinctive that Slocombe was nominated for an Oscar in 19081 for his work on <em>Raiders</em>, and one so memorable that someone like me with only a passing knowledge of the films and the people who made them could look at <em>Great Circle's</em> cutscenes and think, boy, they sure do look like they're shot exactly the same as those movies they're based on. Just like the early films, <em>Great Circle</em> features a ton of heavy contrast, a lot of incredibly moody lighting relying on candles and sunlight, loads of thick shadows and plenty of very, very close shots of Indiana's face.</p><p><em>Raiders</em> went on to become Slocombe's most recognised work (<a href="https://britishcinematographer.co.uk/douglas-slocombe-obe-bsc-raiders-of-the-lost-arc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it cost him the use of one eye after a freak jeep accident!</a>) and while he's sadly no longer with us--<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/douglas-slocombe-obituary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he lived until the grand old age of 103, only passing away in 2016</a>--the fact he left behind such a legacy while being self-taught is incredible. How many other cinematographers do you even <em>know</em>, let alone could so quickly point to the visual signature they've left behind on modern pop culture?</p><p>It's impossible to play <em>Great Circle</em> and not see Machinegames' best attempts at building on that legacy. Just look at some of these shots! Most are from cutscenes where the inspiration can be most literally seen, but there are even moments during gameplay when some light pours through a mysterious tomb's door and you think, uh huh, this is <em>Indiana Jones</em> all right. When you're watching something like this and John Williams' score kicks in and Troy Baker is channelling Harrison Ford you realise this isn't just something cashing in on a beloved license, it genuinely understands every aspect of it and feels like a continuation that could have involved Spielberg and George Lucas themselves.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I've read reviews of this game that are almost critical of <em>Great Circle's </em>cutscenes; they wish this had been a movie and not a game, or that the cutscenes had focused less on action scenes and allowed the player more agency over them. I think Machinegames got the balance just right, because the cutscenes here don't feel like a lesser version of Indy's story, they feel like a thoughtful continuation of it, in ways infinitely preferable to sitting down and watching the last two dogshit movies.</p><p><em>Great Circle</em> is an adaptation so considerate and understanding of the source material that it didn't just stop at copying Indy's voice and hat, it made sure his mannerisms were correct,<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that his limitations were made clear</a>, that the music was perfect and that down to the most minute, oft-overlooked detail--like the lens through which we view the action and the cutscenes--it understood what made Indiana Jones <em>Indiana Jones</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG isn’t waiting until CES begins to <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/12/lg-unveils-worlds-first-bendable-5k2k-gaming-monitor-winner-of-three-awards-at-ces-2025/">reveal its new collection of gaming monitors</a>. The 2025 lineup is led by the UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor, which LG claims is the “world’s first 5K2K-resolution bendable OLED display.” That strikes me as extremely specific, but hey, it’s always worth bragging when you’re first, I suppose. The 45-inch monitor has an expansive resolution of 5120x2160, so you’re getting the same vertical pixel count as a typical 4K screen but a much wider canvas to game on.</p><p>And with a 21:9 aspect ratio, LG believes it provides “a more immersive gaming experience than standard 16:9 displays, while maintaining better content compatibility than 32:9 monitors.” This format also makes the display a great fit for productivity work when you’re not immersed in gameplay.</p><p>The UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor (model 45GX990A) can transition from completely&nbsp;flat to a 900R curvature, and the latest version of LG’s Dual-Mode feature “allows users to switch effortlessly between resolution and refresh rate presets, and customize the&nbsp;aspect ratio and picture size.” It’s certified for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, but the press materials don’t specify a maximum refresh rate. I’ve asked for more details there.</p><div><figcaption><em>Both 45-inch monitors have a 5K2K resolution of 5120x2160.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: LG</cite></p></div><p>LG is also releasing a non-bendable model with a permanent 800R curve. Otherwise, it’s the same 45-inch size, same aspect ratio, and same 5K2K resolution. LG’s press release says you can expect “sharp, lifelike images with the stunning colors and exceptional contrast LG OLED products are known for.” Shared specs between both monitors include a 0.03ms (GtG) response time and support for DisplayPort 2.1, HDMI 2.1, and USB-C with 90W power delivery. The 45GX950A uses a RGWB subpixel layout to improve readability of text on the screen and make the aforementioned productivity work easier on your eyes. </p><p>Along with these two monitors, LG is also introducing the curved UltraGear 39GX90SA, a webOS-powered “home entertainment hub” with easy access to streaming services — just like LG’s TVs. It seems like the company has taken some cues from Samsung’s smart monitors here. At 39 inches, this one’s a bit smaller than the other GX9 displays, but it retains the 21:9 aspect ratio and 800R curve. “Equipped with USB Type-C ports, it offers convenient connectivity, and incorporates LG’s ergonomic and space-saving L-shaped stand for a clutter-free desk setup,” LG said in tonight’s press release.</p><p>As per usual with CES news, pricing and a specific release date are still to come later in 2025. But we’ll be getting our first in-person look at the UltraGear GX9 series in Las Vegas, so stay tuned for impressions early next month — along with an avalanche of stunning screens from many other companies, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disney apparently wants more adaptations of the highly popular Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, as revealed by the Windows Central's Jez Corden in the newest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD58iKzc55c">Xbox Two podcast</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have done enough to impress Disney, so the studio now wants to develop more titles based on the IP. MachineGames, the developer behind the adaption, has done a great job mimicking the original Indiana Jones movies with Great Circle, which has been reflected in the title's popularity over the internet as well. Jez Corden says, "Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones," implying that there are more adventures for the gaming incarnation of Indiana on the way.</p>
<p>The main reason Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have seen such a massive success, at least in terms of how the title turned out, is that MachineGames has a lot of experience with first-person view titles, notably the Wolfenstein series. This is why they have nailed the game in transitioning into various scenarios. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/">support for DLSS 3.5 and full path tracing</a>, the visuals are absolutely exceptional with this title.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not only this, but the title has excelled at replicating the lore of the original movie character, which has resulted in nothing but positive feedback for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">extensive review</a> of the title categorized it as "the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton," which seems to be the consensus among critics and fans alike.</p>
<p>While information around the future of the Indiana Jones series is uncertain, we can be optimistic about the franchise's development now that Disney is interested in getting a proper gaming franchise going. For now, the developers' main focus will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 port</a>, which is scheduled to launch next Spring, and the announced story DLC, The Order of Giants.</p>
<p>By the way, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just been named the "Game of the Year" at the Gamescom tournament. It received 55% of the votes and dominated other big titles released in 2024, like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

                <p><strong>S<em>poilers for Final Fantasy VII [1997], Remake, and Rebirth.</em></strong></p><p dir="ltr">Even with far more barriers in the way, the desperation began almost as soon as the original game was on shelves and the first person saw Aerith die in Final Fantasy VII. The singular question haunted AOL chat rooms, usenet, and game magazine mailboxes for years: Can we bring her back?</p><p dir="ltr">Games have such a strange relationship with the idea of death, so it makes sense that players in 1997--starved of narratives with any real permanent stakes beyond how many quarters you can pump in or whether you really wanted to fight all the way back to the place you died--would have a reaction to Aerith being permanently dead. It’s baked right into the narrative in fact, with Cloud, even with all of his emotional damage, grasping the enormity. “Aerith will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry, or get angry....” Cloud wrestles, in the moment she dies in his arms, with grief for the first time. And Sephiroth does not give a shit. Sephiroth is beyond human concerns. He knows what Cloud is, and flies away with his gentle amusement. Cloud is a puppet. To him, emotions for someone ultimately meaningless in the larger context of time and space are no different than a toddler weeping because it accidentally stepped on a dandelion. But this is the internal struggle that would define the next stretch of FF7. Cloud discovers what he is, and has to come to grips with what it actually means to be human, because just copying Zack Fair’s homework will only get him so far.</p><p dir="ltr">As a singular work, Final Fantasy VII’s ensemble of rebels comes to the end with proud, full hearts, accepting what must be done to save Gaia. But it doesn’t take long for fans and Square Enix to find ways to cheat death, from GameShark codes allowing players to keep Aerith in the party after she’s dead, to Square Enix futzing with their own rules to utilize Aerith in Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts. In a medium where death is always an easily solvable problem—hell, in a game series where resurrection is usually one Phoenix Down away—Aerith being dead should be a temporary inconvenience at best. She’s only mostly dead, right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416847" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416847"></a><figcaption>Aerith strikes her iconic pose in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The greatest gift, and the greatest power of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, is that there is no such respite to be had in it. From the second the game starts, Aerith’s days are numbered, with the inevitable moment when players would have to grapple with the potential of her martyr’s death acting as an oppressive weight on the entire game. The dread of Shinra, Sephiroth, and the lifestream itself, all of which could put an end to our party’s quest, adds to the pressure, forcing our party and every playable character to contend with the peril in their own way. The only one who never buckles is Aerith.</p><p dir="ltr">Aerith, from the very start of Remake, knows more than anyone about where the path leads for her and her friends. It’s never said outright, but the implication is seeded fairly often that she knows how she dies. It becomes clear how many forces conspire against them, threatening to tear the entire party of heroes asunder. And yet, in that moment, standing outside Midgar, all Aerith can do is look at the possibilities of the green, verdant world stretching in front of her, and be grateful for the company she gets to share it with. There’s something to be said for just how much of Rebirth is sidequests,new mechanics you get to use once and never again, and strange flights of fancy. And yet, unlike most open world games, that friction between the importance of the greater quest and the frivolity of the optional stuff isn’t so much a dissonant note, but the entire point.</p><p dir="ltr">As the game comes to a close, Aerith takes an unconscious Cloud through her memories of the Midgar Slums. Shinra is flying to the Temple of the Ancients, and Aerith wants you to try candy.</p><p dir="ltr">Sephiroth is waiting for his chance to murder everyone. Aerith wants you to pick out jewelry.The multiverse that is Final Fantasy VII is threatening to collapse. Aerith wants nothing more than for Cloud to look at her and hold her hand.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416851" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416851"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-world-is-ending-but-heres-a-side-quest-will-rpgs-ever-solve-their-urgency-problem" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer article not long ago</a> where Robert Purchase asked a reasonable if misguided question: “Why is it that in a role-playing game where the stakes are usually 'the end of the world', the end of the world always has to wait for us to finish our sprawling to-do list first?” A reasonable question approached from the wrong angle. The question, more often than not, is why the end of the world always feels inconsequential? There’s a reason why 0% speedruns of Breath of the Wild where players rocket over to fight Calamity Ganon the second they put a shirt on never feel out of pocket: that’s a game that holds the consequences of saving the world cheap, in order for the player to create that treasured immersion developers love so much. Nintendo’s far from alone on that; this is how most open experiences are meant to operate to give players power.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy VII was never designed in a way where the threat of Sephiroth, Meteor, Shinra et al were meant to fade into the background. Once Sephiroth makes the fateful call, the beautiful overworld music vanishes, replaced by one of the most ominous pieces of music Nobuo Uematsu would ever compose. You literally cannot step outside without remembering what must be done, and part of why it’s effective is because we’ve seen the game willing to take someone precious away from the player to get there-- something irretrievable and irreplaceable. It’s only after the fact that players and Square tried to fill the hole of Aerith’s absence without retconning the whole thing. Rebirth, on the other hand, knows where it’s headed from minute one.Right from the beginning, it’s begging players to look at what they have, the world they inhabit, and the people who make their home here; the humanity that Sephiroth holds so cheap and the friends so dedicated to preserving it all that they’re willing to look the silver-haired, one-winged angel of death in his smug fucking face and tell him that “yes, we’re going to fight you for all this.” And by then, players will have a deep, beautiful basis of experiences in life and love to back that up.</p><p dir="ltr">That brings us to the moment.The moment in which it almost looks like Square might spare us the pain of watching Aerith--now a character so much more genuinely and beautifully written and executed than her 1997 counterpart--die in Cloud’s arms again. But no. Despite some deft swordplay, Aerith is stabbed. The materia falls down the stairs. The theme plays. And again, many will weep. As it turns out, this is, to borrow another multiverse’s parlance, a <a href="https://intothespiderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Canon_Events" rel="nofollow ">canon event</a>. Even given how much Remake and Rebirth stray from the path we all know, some things are inevitable. Aerith dies in the Temple of Ancients every time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416853" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416853"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But something’s different about Rebirth. Through Cloud’s temporary surrender to outright madness and nihilism, we’ve seen just how much of this universe is inevitable. But the magic of it is this: you are encouraged to fight it anyway. Humanity--being a thinking, feeling, emotional being--demands it. And the real difference between Rebirth and the vast majority of experiences is that everything you’ve done prior informs it.</p><p dir="ltr">This seems to be a running motif in Square’s work in the FF series of late, with XV and XVI both playing with the idea that, while ruin is inevitable every tiny interaction creates a vast tapestry of reasons to save the world anyway. Despite being faced with death time and again, Square has asked us to revel in these peoples’ lives, in all their messy glory, because it all actually matters. When death comes--and it comes heavy in all these games--it has a face. Life, on the other hand, has many. And the sacrifice of confronting the end of all things means absolutely nothing without seeing those faces first. In a truly meaningful RPG narrative, that is why the end of the world must be allowed to wait.</p><p dir="ltr">For Final Fantasy VII, we have spent literally real-world decades waiting for the opportunity to stop Aerith from going away, never truly accepting that our time with her is short. Rebirth’s great power is that it gives us more of that. We have all the time in the world to fall in love with the very act of being alive and breathing the way she does, so that when the end comes, there aren’t regrets.</p><p dir="ltr">When Aerith died in 1997, all Cloud could focus on was the loss--the things we can never get back, the things she will never do again.</p><p dir="ltr">When Aerith dies in 2024, Cloud swallows the sorrow, holds her hand, and tells her, "I got this."

But still. Cloud knows it's not her. He can't suddenly give Aerith back to his world, and he will be uniquely equipped to share what he knows of her to get his friends through it. Our heroes mourn. But it is so much more important that Rebirth shows they are not doing it alone, and that all of them are better for having known her.</p><p>And thus, Rebirth imparts its lesson. One of the hardest but most crucial lessons of the year. We have had to let Aerith go for so long, many of us forgot why it hurt to begin with. But Rebirth lets us remember, and revel in it, and finally accept. We let her go, gladly, having fought, played, and sung with her in ways we never imagined back on PS1. There is an art to accepting the end is coming. The Remake project altogether has been, above all else, an invitation to look out at the horizon and, even knowing it has an end, to revel in what’s ahead regardless.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-playstation-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 was a bit of a bumpy road for PlayStation. Things started out well with the surprise success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, the critically acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the slick action duo of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>. But things took a downward turn in the summer thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord’s</a> (failure to) launch. The doomed hero shooter and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">subsequent closing of developer Firewalk Studios</a> was certainly a low point for Sony, even if a delightful little robot did his best to brighten the mood in the fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>. Since then we’ve seen the arrival of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, an even more powerful PlayStation 5 console that comes at an eye-wateringly premium price and has been met with a mixed reception. But with time ticking away, there’s barely time left in 2024 to dwell on PlayStation’s past. It already feels like time to look ahead to 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what does the upcoming year have in store for PlayStation? With almost all of its first-party studios keeping cards close to chests, you may be mistaken for thinking things are looking quiet. But let's delve in deeper to see exactly what games to expect for the PS5 in 2025, as well as make a few hopeful guesses of our own.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Games We Know Are Coming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, let’s look at what is scheduled to come from those all-important PlayStation Studios. Sucker Punch’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is certainly looking like the headline attraction, and it’s coming to the PS5 in 2025. The sequel to 2020’s open-world samurai adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, is set to be a stunner as we’re introduced to both a new hero and Northern Japanese location. Let’s hope for some gameplay trailers early next year or in the summer, ahead of a winter release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, the debut game from Haven Studios. It’s a multiplayer heist shooter, and so it will certainly be fascinating to see what lessons PlayStation has learned from the live-service disaster of Concord. First revealed in 2023, we’re yet to see any gameplay, but hopefully that doesn’t mean it won’t hit its target of a 2025 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And… those are the only PlayStation Studios games we currently know are slated for a 2025 release. And with no actual release dates locked in yet, we can barely plot out what to expect in each part of the year. But that isn’t to say there won’t be more big games coming to the PS5 next year, though, and we can certainly theorise at what else we might see from some of Sony’s first-party stable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We now know that Naughty Dog’s next adventure will take us to the stars in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. We don’t expect to be playing this in 2025, though, but we’ll happily eat up any more info Neil Druckmann and the team wants to share about it – especially if that includes some of that laser blade gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has a lot of weight resting on its shoulders, not only because it will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">Bungie’s first full release since it was acquired by Sony</a>, but alongside Fairgames, it will be PlayStation’s first big new live-service shooter to follow in the quickly fading footsteps of Concord. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> developers have as strong a shooter pedigree as anyone in the business, so it will certainly be interesting to see the result of its work as it aims to revive its long-dormant 90s series as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could 2025 be the year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> emerges from its oily cocoon? Hideo Kojima was at The Game Awards but didn’t bring a new trailer with him. Unacceptable behaviour, if you ask me. Are we any closer to knowing what it’s all about? Who’s to say, but we certainly want to play it. And the sooner we can, the sooner Kojima can move on to working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, the upcoming stealth-action PlayStation exclusive from the Metal Gear master.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to – especially if you’re into big swords. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> looks set to be a flashy hack-and-slash action RPG from Chinese studio S-Game. A semi-open world samurai bloodfest with soulslike elements, it certainly doesn’t look to be lacking in style. No release date has been given as yet, but let's hope for next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of blades, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/where-winds-meet">Where Winds Meet</a> is a PS5 console-exclusive RPG set in ancient China. Taking place during the Ten Kingdoms Era, you step into the shoes of a warrior who wields influence over warring dynasties, shaping history with the point of your sword, as well as mystical and magical abilities. Originally set for a 2024 release before being delayed to add even more content to its packed, mammoth open world, it wouldn’t be a shock to see it finally arrive within the next 12 months.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, there are more swords and even bigger blades in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ballad-of-antara">Ballad of Antara</a>, a free-to-play co-op action RPG packed with multiple protagonists and intertwining stories coming to the PS5 in 2025. We’ll get a better look at it soon, with a beta promised to be on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Think we’re done with swords? Think again. This next game even has one in the title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword of the Sea</a>. You don’t use this one to fight with, though; instead, you’ll be plonking your feet on it and riding around at speed, Tony Hawk and Metaphor: ReFantazio style. From Abzû and The Pathless studio Giant Squid, the reveal trailer couldn’t help but remind us of Journey, as a mysterious cloaked character hoverswords around vast desert ruins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another relatively fresh announcement, having only been revealed at September’s State of Play, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> is the next game from Lost in Random developer Moonhood Studios. An adventure handcrafted from clay, it’s set to be one of the most visually striking games of 2025. Plus, it’s even coming out on PS VR2. At least someone is helping out that long-forgotten little guy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last PS5 console exclusive we’re going to highlight is a game we wrote about exactly this time last year in our 2024 PlayStation look-ahead. Hopefully 2025 will be the year we finally get to clumsily bumble our way through the world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. A PS5 console-exclusive, the team up from the developers behind Getting Over It and Ape Out looks equal parts agonising as it does hilarious.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That may be it for exclusives, but there are plenty more multiplatform games coming out in 2025 that are set to make it a bumper year for PlayStation players. Alongside the arrival of I<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">ndiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> onto PS5, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> to name but a few. Oh, and a little game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Could be good. Who knows.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hopes and Dreams</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the fun part: the section where we get to cross our fingers and conjure up games that don’t exist yet, but maybe will appear before our eyes in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac has had a relatively quiet year – for a studio that puts out new releases with such regularity, that is – but understandable considering it continues to recover from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">data breach suffered at the end of 2023</a>. We know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> is in the works but don’t yet know exactly when it will be in our hands. And, if rumours are to be believed, a Venom game is scheduled to arrive before it. While it may be unlikely that we’ll be playing either of these superhero stories within the next 12 months, we might get a clearer picture of what is coming next from the Spidey studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can be said for Santa Monica Studio. What’s next for the God of War developer is a mystery, although we do know Cory Barlog – game director of 2018’s God of War – moved on to helm a new project in 2021 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-director-cory-barlog-unannounced-projects">after leaving Eric Williams to fill Ragnarok’s director seat</a>. Could we see what Barlog’s game is in 2025?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other studios, can we expect yet more delves into the world of Horizon from Guerrilla Games, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">an online multiplayer game reportedly in development</a> at the Amsterdam developers? And it's been a long time since Bend released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> – almost six whole years, in fact – and the studio has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-unannounced-project-logo-reveal">hinted that it's making another open-world adventure</a>. Little is known apart from that, but it’s safe to say we’d like to learn more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The truth is, we know very little about what is in the pipeline from many of Sony’s first-party studios, so don’t be surprised if the PS5 is in for another relatively quiet year in 2025. We’d be more than happy to be wrong about that, though, and be pleasantly surprised by a flurry of reveals and releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, could <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-becomes-majority-shareholder-in-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-no-full-takeover-for-now">Sony’s interest in acquiring the massive Kadokawa company</a> (which, alongside a huge anime portfolio, also owns FromSoftware) finally result in a Bloodborne remaster or sequel? I know we said these are hopes and dreams… but don’t be silly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hardware and Tech</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of hardware, Sony has been very busy over the past couple of years with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-vr2">PS VR2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> all released to varying levels of success. As a result, we expect things to be quieter on the hardware front when it comes to 2025. However, it may be the year that we see the PS5 Pro justify itself further as an expensive upgrade if games like Ghost of Yotei and GTA 6 start to push the base PlayStation 5 to its limit. It will certainly be interesting to see how developers embrace this new tech over the next year or so, and if we start to see genuinely impressive comparisons between the original PS5 and Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while we expect actual hardware releases to be quiet, we’ve heard whispers that there may be some news to share of fresh PlayStation tech in 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-set-to-take-on-nintendo-with-new-portable-playstation-report">Could we see Sony take another stab at the handheld market?</a> Just stick some internal storage into the Portal. I have no qualifications when it comes to hardware engineering, but how hard can it be, lads? In all seriousness, though, if recent reports are to be believed, then maybe we could actually see a successor to the PSP and PS Vita in the coming year, or at least an announcement of one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be honest, it’s all guesswork isn’t it? Got your own theories and hopes for what we’ll see from PlayStation in 2025? Let us know in the comments below, as well as what you’re most excited to play.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/witch-path-of-exile-2-best-summons/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playing-a-witch-in-path-of-exile-2-these-are-the-best-summons.1070850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/witch-path-of-exile-2-best-summons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Witch was always a fan-favorite in the first Path of Exile, and that didn’t change with the launch of its sequel. People still gravitate toward the Witch for several reasons, primarily because she has powerful summons. With the right combination of skills and abilities, you can roam a map as the powerful Witch, clearing mobs of enemies without lifting a finger. But first, it’s best to learn the best summons in Path of Exile 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-choose-these-top-summons-for-witch-in-path-of-exile-2">Choose These Top Summons for Witch in Path of Exile 2</h2>



<p>Playing as a Witch proves more entertaining than you’d initially imagine. I mean, Chaos magic is downright fun to use and often quite powerful, but you’ll spend more time playing catch-up after your minions slay the entire zone ahead of you instead of casting a powerful bolt of magic.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>You have a handful of choices while playing as Witch, namely:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Frost Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Warrior</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These are in order from “best” to “worst” of the ones we recommend you use. Some may favor Skeletal Warriors above Zombies. The latter is a weak, time-limited unit that decays quickly, but you can spawn more quickly, nearly endlessly, to have a constant flow of minions dominating the battlefield. They’re an excellent tool that works similarly to a meat shield between your squishy Witch and the countless hard-hitting enemies across Wraeclast.</p>



<p>Skeletal Sniper is perhaps one of the most effective and useful summons available, as they deal ranged poison damage that bursts into a cloud of noxious fumes designed to deal area-of-effect damage and lock down mobs. For a similar effect, albeit less effective and with fire, Skeletal Arsonists come in second place.</p>



<p>However, keep in mind that Path of Exile 2 is currently in Early Access. Grinding Gear Games is still working on balancing and will likely change the effectiveness of many abilities before and after launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/undaunted-stalingrad-review-the-campaign-begins.1070841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-stalingrad-review-campaign-begins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undanuted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>. This time we're looking at <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>, which introduced a campaign setting to&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> in one of the most challenging military campaigns of the modern era.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-3.jpg?itok=nEq2SZel 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-3.jpg?itok=GvfXQq3N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>'s map tiles not only get destroyed as the campaign unfolds but they can also be fortified.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to work out how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>

In <em>Stalingrad</em>, both players start with the similar but not for the artwork decks, but over time, as you take losses and your troops gain experience, you will replace them with inferior replacements, upgrade them, gain new units, or maybe just lose them completely from your deck.</p>

<p>The map too changes over time, expanding, but also reacting to missions and the destruction you bring. Each mission directly links from the previous, and the campaign branches and adapts depending on the last, and with 35 possible scenarios in the book, along with each of the 2 factions having their own scenario book with background narrative and scenario rules, every time you play through will be different (unless you complete exactly the same mission with exactly the same results and the same losses somehow).</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>features the 2 historical forces that were part of the campaign during WWII, the Germans and the Soviets. Both factions start with the same decks, but they have different upgrades and additions as the campaign develops. We're keeping this review spoiler-free, but the differences are very on-theme and in keeping with the forces of the time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=ztqI8vIp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=OdjUGivU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As the&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>campaign progresses, the Game State will change depending on the winner of each scenario.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Campaign Work In Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>At the end of each scenario, along with removing casualties from your deck, and upgrading troops, the game also tracks the game state with a number. Using a table, you take the current game state number, and depending on who the victor is, change the game state to the new number based on that scenario.</p>

<p>The game state also tells you which background section of the scenario book for your force to read, and then which scenario to play next. The scenario then tells you which cards to unlock, your objectives for that game, and any special rules to play.</p>

<p>The developing map and changing deck really does bring home the pressures of war, and makes you consider your decisions in battle. It's easy to throw troops forward when you know everything resets for the next game, but when you're several games into a campaign, and you know that losing a tank could put you on the back foot for the rest of the campaign, your strategy will change.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> is designed for the long haul and that's where it shines. Both players need to be happy going in that there's going to be a few games to get to the end of the campaign, to get the most out of it, rather than the pick-up and play options in the earlier <em>Undaunted</em> products.</p>

<p><i>Undaunted Stalingrad&nbsp;</i>is a fantastic if somber experience. Anyone who's read my reviews before will know that theme is huge for me, as it's easy to put a thematic skin on some mechanics in order to gain audience buy-in, but <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> really captures what was a horrendous, grueling campaign for both sides. It takes the solid <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics, and mixes them extremely well with the branching legacy campaign, along with capturing the unique feel of both forces, which was also very pleasing to see.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a quick pick up and play game, as a new player, or a previous <em>Undaunted</em> player, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is at it's best when played as part of the legacy campaign, and you should try out one of the other <em>Undaunted</em> options (<em>2200 Callisto</em>&nbsp;has a linked campaign, but you can play any scenario you wish). If you're not a fan of the WWII theme, then this leans into it very heavily, and when you're deep in the campaign, it's hard to see past it. If you want an incredibly thematic experience, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is that, but if you want a deck-builder wargame hybrid without the WWII theme, then try <em>2200 Callisto</em>.</p>

		<p>While 2024 has not arguably been one of the biggest years for exclusives, Sony has still had some big hitters come in. Those include remakes and reimaginings of beloved favourites, the dawn of new IPs that could go on to establish themselves as part of the PlayStation Pantheon, and more memorable experiences that will live on in memory whether you’re new to gaming or have been part of the PlayStation journey since the beginning. With that in mind, there could only have been one clear winner for this award.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> is pure, unfiltered joy. What better game to win Best PlayStation than one that celebrates everything PlayStation from its 30 year history? Astro Bot is more than just a celebration though. It is the culmination of a character that found its beginning in the original PSVR era, and then introduced players to all the features of the PS5, and now being cemented as the current PlayStation mascot.</p>
<p>Astro Bot has so many elements to it that make it great. Levels are based on classic franchises, there are plenty of Bot characters to find hidden away, tons of secrets to uncover, and it is getting regular free updates with even more content to play through. It looks stunning, it sounds stunning, and the gameplay of Astro Bot is really smooth too. Astro Bot captures the very core of the message Play Has No Limits.</p>
<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> was one of those gaming phenomena where it feels like literally everyone is playing the exact same thing… or at least trying to, as servers inevitably crumbled during the early days and weeks. Taking Arrowhead’s familiar formula of friendly fire filled co-op action, but adapting it now to a third person shooter, just being able to blast bugs like its 1999’s Starship Troopers was enough to grab everyone’s attention, but that initial drop would lead to another, and then another, and then another.</p>

<p>The initial hook was the humour of the excessive military might you could call upon for backup, while being inherently very, very squishy and prone to being caught in the explosion that you or your friends just called in. Throw in a meta-game of planetary conquest/liberation played against a DM within Arrowhead, and a wild obsession with a planet that quickly became dubbed ‘Space Vietnam’, and Helldivers 2 was pretty much all that anyone was talking about for a month or two following its release. That’s the stuff that GOTY contenders are made of!</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner-up</h2>
<p>It’s a little wild to think that a remake of a game that’s more than two decades old could be hemmed in by technical limitations, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> leaving the PS4 behind and going all in on the current generation, that seems to have been the case. This middle chapter in the remake trilogy goes all in on having broad open areas that are stuffed with things to do, whether that’s fixing chocobo stops, settling in for a round of Fort Condor, or getting stuck in with some challenge battles to perfect your use of the subtle new tweaks in combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the real draw is still going to be the retelling of the JRPG classic’s story, which is handled masterfully well as it fleshes out the middle third of the tale, further exploring the cast of characters and additional backstory in ways that the original couldn’t. It’s a good thing there’s so much side content to help tide fans over until the series’ conclusion.</p>
