			<p>Ever since the PlayStation 5 Pro specs were leaked, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) was arguably the most interesting new feature. Yes, the additional Compute Units, faster memory, and improved ray tracing capabilities are great, but Sony has also developed a custom AI upscaling feature, which is probably going to be critical in delivering high frame rates while keeping the ray traced effects in place.</p>
<p>Now that everything has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, CNET <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-pro-hands-on-sonys-699-turbo-console-hits-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> some interesting news as part of their exclusive hands-on with PS5 Pro. According to the outlet, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution has been confirmed to work across the full library without game developers having to release a specific PS5 Pro patch. If that was the case, it'd be a big selling point for all those fans still on the fence after learning of the hefty price tag ($699, £699, €799) of the console.</p>
<p>However, the PlayStation 5 Pro's reveal trailer actually says something different when the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution feature is mentioned on the screen:</p>
<p><em>Feature only available on select PS5 games that have been enhanced for PS5 Pro.</em></p>
<p>We have asked Sony to clarify whether CNET's info is correct and will update the story if we hear back. Meanwhile, CNET also learned from Lead System Architect Mark Cerny that PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution will eventually work on PS VR2 games, which would be great as well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ps5pro-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Furthermore, Cerny shared some interesting statements with CNET about Sony's latest console, which will launch globally on November 7.</p>
<p><em>I've already seen games with three different PS5 Pro modes. As time goes by, particularly for the games which are launching after the hardware releases, we'll increasingly see a more nuanced approach, where the focus is less on resolution, and much more about higher image quality through a variety of strategies.</em></p>
<p><em>PS5 Pro uses the new advanced ray tracing feature sets that AMD created as the next step in their roadmap architecture But if you look around, there are no other AMD GPUs that use it yet. We motivated the development, and I'm very happy we did so -- the response from the developers has been extraordinarily great.</em></p>
<p>Are you planning to get the PS5 Pro at launch? Let us know below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today a new Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns trailer was released by Warner Bros. Games, using the trailer to showcase Noob Saibot's gameplay, as he is one of the six new playable characters joining the game via <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns/">the expansion</a>. The trailer gives players an in-depth look at his abilities and moveset, as well as the story that will coincide with his appearance in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a> and the re-imagined universe of the game.</p>
<p>The trailer is just over three minutes long and expands on Liu Kang's New Era with a new story campaign showcasing Liu Kang's champions as they work together to battle Titan Havik, who wants to destroy the realms as they know it. Below is the three-minute trailer where you can see Noob Saibot in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns – Official Noob Saibot Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jb-HBuF5XsQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this re-imaged universe, Liu Kang is the Fire God and is in his New Era, and stole Bi-Han's soul to create Noob Saibot. In the original timeline, Bi-Han became Sub-Zero and was Lin Kuei's Grandmaster who wanted to make his clan a dominant force. However, now as Noob Saibot, Bi-Han is dedicated to eradicating all forms of authority.</p>
<p>The trailer showcases Noob Saibot's aggressive moveset, where he can use teleportation to slam his opponents down, as well as using spectral projectiles that can detonate after attaching to his opponents. He can also use a multitude of shadow-assisted attacks to damage his foes. With Animalities making a return to the game, the trailer for Noob Saibot also shows off a glimpse of his Animality, where he can transform into a crocodile to destroy his opponent.</p>
<p>While most of the content in the trailer for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns is paid, Animalities will be available as a free update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners on September 24, the day of the release.</p>
<p>The new expansion will be released on September 24, introducing six new playable characters: Cyrax, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-gets-new-trailer-for-sektor/">Sektor</a>, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, T-1000 and Conan the Barbarian. Additionally, there will be new Story mode chapters which will be available on release date so that players can get up to date on the lore of this re-imagined universe. The expansion will be released at 4 PM BST / 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Those who have pre-ordered the new expansion will receive four new character skins, which include Wedding Scorpion, Empress Mileena and Klassic Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Sub-Zero, and Noob Saibot, all of which will be available on release day.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Satisfactory Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/satisfactory-review-in-progress.977115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This has been a hard review to write. Not because I don't know what to say, but because every time I dip back into Satisfactory to look up an item name or confirm some detail, I find myself checking in on the state of my workshop, just for a moment, and then several hours have suddenly flown by. That’s the magic of this seemingly benign, inexplicably alluring factory simulator. Whether I’m pulling my hair out trying to troubleshoot a problem on the factory floor or running away from very disrespectful fireball-spitting aliens, every moment spent in this beautifully complex simulator has been worthwhile. Combining the creativity and exploration of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review">Minecraft</a> with the spreadsheet-inducing planning and optimization of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/factorio-review">Factorio</a>, Satisfactory is not only the best game I’ve played this year, but my favorite automation game of all time – and that’s without even having reached its final engineering challenges after going <em>hard </em>on a fresh world in its 1.0 build for more than 90 hours. Unless the final stretch of leveling up my factory takes an unexpectedly nightmarish turn for the worse, so far Satisfactory has been an unbelievably good time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Satisfactory Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Satisfactory is an immediately compelling factory simulator where you and up to three friends are dropped on an alien planet and told you need to establish a base and produce increasingly complicated materials and launch them into outer space to appease your boss. In order to do so, you’ll need to harvest natural resources, develop new technologies, and become a master of conveyor belts, pipelines, and eventually even locomotive operations as you triumphantly grow your tiny headquarters into a planet-encompassing labyrinth of moving parts. More and more is asked of you as you go, and what starts out as a simple process of gathering leaves and mining iron to make basic tools quickly spirals into a convoluted whirlwind of refineries, manufacturing plants, and nuclear power grids, where you’re producing everything from computer chips to rocket fuel. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each breakthrough moment organically leads to the next mountain to climb.</p></div><p>If you're wondering how in the heck assembly line optimization could possibly be fun, I understand your confusion. But in the same way that something like No Man’s Sky gives you a ton of creative freedom while providing irresistible goals to chase along the way, Satisfactory never stops giving you exciting new reasons to keep playing I cannot fathom the number of times I promised myself I’d log off after I tweaked <em>just one more thing</em> only to find myself still tinkering away hours later. Each breakthrough moment, like figuring out how oil refineries work and starting the production of plastic, organically leads to the next mountain to climb, like crafting a rifle and producing ammo with the byproducts of said refineries. Before you know it, you hear those alarming morning chirps from birds outside your window and realize you’ve made a mistake.</p><p>Managing ever more complex factories can be pretty daunting at times, but Satisfactory does an absolutely stellar job of nudging you to take small, manageable steps with its checklist of projects to tackle, and in no time at all you and your friends are managing sprawling operations that would have seemed unfathomable at the start. The earliest factory I built began as a few buildings scattered about the untainted wilderness, which quickly spiraled into a horrendous and disorderly web of nonsensically crisscrossing conveyor belts that looked like a bowl of wet noodles (naturally, I dubbed the settlement Spaghettysburg). That amateurish anarchy might be unintuitive and less than optimal, but hey, it gets the job done, and I victoriously delivered my eminent Spaghettysburg address to my co-op partners as we launched the fruits of our labor into space amid the mess of mechanical pasta. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The real fun is in watching your mini society evolve.</p></div><p>Later on, my crew’s creations became more structured and efficient, like our coastal oil refinery dubbed Gas Town or our railway system, which we suspended in the air for maximum orderliness. The real fun is in watching your mini society evolve as you solve progressively more difficult engineering challenges, such as optimizing and expanding your power grid to fuel more facilities so you can produce more complicated parts, or running the math on the ideal ore output of a mining rig to figure out the most efficient way to smelt it into ingots. And you don't have to be a spreadsheet geek like me or dive deep into third-party wikis to simply see a conveyor belt full of unused materials backing up and feel the irresistible urge to do something about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As you’re required to make dozens of different components and juggle a large number of demanding processes in order to complete the Milestone deliveries that make up Satisfactory's larger progression, you’re constantly switching to wherever your attention is needed most, solving problems and using the new technology you create along the way to make your life easier. For example, early on, I built comically long conveyor belts to move resources from other parts of the world to my main factory, but after unlocking new technologies and manufacturing more advanced parts, I was able to automatically transport resources with trucks, trains, and even flying drones, making things faster, cleaner, and frankly, less chaotic in the process. Going from an unwashed, melee-swinging, conveyor belt-abusing troglodyte to a jetpacking, gun-toting man of tomorrow is immensely satisfying, and makes each hard-fought battle of electrical wiring well worth the trouble.</p><p>When you’re not juggling the hundreds of things to do with your factory operations, you’ll take to the vast open world to explore the map, battle beasties, evade poison gas and irradiated zones, find hidden treasures, and befriend gross-looking lizard doggos to serve as your loyal companions. Opting for a single, hand-crafted world instead of the more common procedurally generated areas found in some of its peers, Satisfactory’s map has a diverse set of regions with their own vibes and valuable resources to plunder that are awesome to explore and even better to colonize with your hungry machines. As you gain access to new tools, you’ll get better equipment to take out into exploration, which then gives you access to even more areas. For example, crafting a gas mask lets you navigate zones overrun with poisonous clouds, unlocking the jetpack allows you scale cliffs that would otherwise be difficult to reach, and researching explosives allows you to blast through troublesome rocks so you can delve into caves and other blocked off areas. Each of these developments completely changes what’s possible while out in the world, which in turn allows you to acquire better materials to bring back to your base, creating a loop of building and exploration that just doesn’t quit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It goes from great to downright amazing once you add friends.</p></div><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be much of an alien planet if there weren't hostile creatures everywhere who are quite interested in seeing your violent demise. You’ll unlock a few melee weapons and some basic guns and ammo, but combat isn’t anything special as it clearly isn’t the intended focus of Satisfactory. It only took me a few hours before I realized I’d seen just about everything combat had to offer, and while it’s not actively bad, it’s just a bit forgettable when the building and exploration are so great. The alien wildlife mostly seems to be there to provide a touch of danger whenever I go looking for new resources, but it's still a bit disappointing that there only seem to be four types of creatures to encounter, each with a few different variations that make them more deadly but not any more interesting. </p><p>Playing Satisfactory alone can be a lot of fun, but once you add friends to the mix it goes from great to downright amazing. Not only does building with friends allow you to get more done quicker and bounce ideas off one another, but you can each take off to a different part of the map and still work towards shared goals by building infrastructure to transport goods and players from place-to-place. One especially cool aspect is that, once you unlock supernatural alien technology that defies the laws of physics (which happens surprisingly early rather than being wasted on the endgame alone), you can begin sharing resources with one another remotely by uploading your bounty to the Dimensional Depot, which anyone can pull items directly into their inventory from at any time. This creates a really cool dynamic, where a player you haven’t seen in the world for several hours can pipe up to ask for help with something, and you can virtually hand them the resources they need to solve their problem.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Games That Are Way Too Complicated</h3><p>Sometimes it just feels good to sweat all over your keyboard with beautifully convoluted mechanics. These are the best games to play if that mood strikes you.</p></div><p>If there’s one real issue with Satisfactory, it’s that sometimes its ambition exceeds its grasp, leading to a pretty steady stream of performance issues and bugs (at least on the pre-release 1.0 build I had access to for this review). Crashes were a regular occurrence for my crew, especially for those joining my world for multiplayer, and as your factory grows to an absurd size and complexity, you’ll start to see pop-in, weird textures, and framerate dips with increasing frequency. I played on three separate PCs of varying levels of power, and though each could run Satisfactory fine at the outset, by the end only my Ryzen 9 7950X3D/<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition-review">RTX 4090</a> could run it without at least moderate issues. You’ll likely need a fairly powerful rig to run this one with consistency, but even when it struggled a bit on two of my PCs, those problems were only ever an annoyance rather than anything so severe that they made me want to stop playing.</p><p>I’ve played over 90 hours of Satisfactory's 1.0 release, and I already have a pretty good idea of where I stand with it at this point, but I’ve still got a final round of uber-challenging endgame tasks to complete before I’ve seen it all and can confidently deliver my verdict. For now, I can tell you that there’s a whole heckuva lot to enjoy. Now, if you don’t mind, I really should get back to it – these production pipelines aren’t going to optimize themselves!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/satisfactory-temp-score-1725937010222.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Your passion, love for Kay, Nix, our open world and all your amazing creations through our Photo mode has been a real inspiration for the whole team.”</p><p>The patch focuses on early feedback to address various issues and PC performance, as well as overall stability, Ubisoft said. Additionally, cross progression and saves through Ubisoft Connect are now available.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But the highlight is an improvement to what Ubisoft called “some challenging stealth moments.” With this patch, it is now less likely to be detected while rolling, and the level of detection is adjusted depending on location.</p><p>Creative director Julian Gerighty had admitted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-unfair-instant-fail-stealth-missions-a-mistake-dev-admits-patch-due-next-week">Outlaws’ instant fail stealth missions were "incredibly punishing" and signaled they’d be fixed soon</a>. "For me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving," he said.</p><p>"I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable."</p><p>"I think it feels unfair.

Ubisoft has yet to comment.</p><p>IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>Star Wars Outlaws review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Star Wars Outlaws is a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch." </p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws - Title Update 1.1.2 patch notes:</h2><p><strong>New Feature</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cross-progression and saving is now available between all platforms through Ubisoft Connect.

It comes with a 2TB SSD, but all of the games you install will be downloaded from the PlayStation Store, because the PS5 does not have a disc drive.

The company's next major release will come on November 15 with Assassin's Creed Shadows, a highly anticipated entry in the series that fans have wanted for years. Ubisoft has remained stubbornly independent (and public) as many other gaming companies of its size have been purchased by even larger players in the industry, most notably Activision. Tencent did buy a minority stake in the company in 2022, but it has no board seats.</p>

            <p>
If you've been feeling a little trucked out with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>'s existing 15 states, and have been dreaming of more beatiful tarmac to traverse soon, there's good news: developer SCS Software has announced its Arkansas expansion will arrive next Monday, 16th September. And ahead of that, there's a major new patch adding improved controller support and more.
</p>
<p>
"Located in the south-central region of the United States," explains SCS in its blurb for American Truck Simulator's Arkansas expansion, "the state is a nature wonderland with three national forests, many State Parks, nearly 9,000 miles of pristine streams and rivers like the Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as the ever-stretching Ozark and Ouachita mountain ranges."
</p>
<p>
As such, truckers hitting the road through SCS' version of Arkansas can expect ample natural beauty, alongside "large and small towns and cities, where you'll find industries, landmarks and more." All of which will bring American Truck Simulator's current US state tally up to 16, following on from Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

<p>
As to what's next, SCS Software has already confirmed Iowa and Missouri are in development, meaning it'll need to turn its attention to North and South Dakota, Minnesota, and Louisiana at some point, if it wants to plug up some gaps.
</p>
<p>
But ahead of all that, and indeed Arkansas' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585150/American_Truck_Simulator__Arkansas/">arrival on Steam</a> next week, SCS has released a major new American Truck Simulator patch - officially known as update 1.51 - introducing a whole bunch of new features. There is, for instance, a brand-new title screen to match SCS' recent interface overhaul, as well as new realistic shadows for truck interiors. Additionally, the Nebraska DLC's dynamic loading and unloading feature for grain hopper trailers has now been expanded to Kansas, Arkansas, and other "prefab" depots across the game.
</p>
<p>
That's alongside new controller configuration settings intended to offer "more flexibility and control". SCS says players should now be able to control more game features using a controller - in a way that "resembles driving a vehicle in real life" - which will apparently "pave the way for exciting future projects". Console ports, perhaps? Time will tell!

<p>
Additionally, once 1.51 is installed, owners of American Truck Simulator's Oklahoma expansion can travel the entirety of Interstate 44, with SCS' latest update finally connecting its east and west portions by adding the previously missing midsection through Oklahoma City. In other expansion refresh news, Oregon now has its own cinematic custom city intros, and if you've got the Texas expansion, you may noticed some vegetation tweaks, with the eastern side of the state now home to loblolly pines, creating a smoother transition into Arkansas.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-%E2%80%93-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5.977061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After months and months of rumours and speculation, Sony has finally taken the wraps off the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, a mid-generation spec bump that aims to banish the choice between Fidelity mode and Performance modes. Here’s what we now know about the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 5 Pro Console - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HaRMiTfvks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>PS5 Pro release date, price &amp; pre-orders</h2>
<p>One of the main things to know about the PS5 Pro is when it’s coming out and how much it will cost. The launch date for the PS5 Pro is set for 7th November 2024. Pre-orders will go live on 26th September 2024.</p>


<p>As for the cost, I hope you’ve been saving up, because it will set you back $700 / £700 /€800 / ¥120,000.</p>
<p>Note that this is a disc-less console at that price, with support for the optional UHD drive add-on debuted alongside the PS5 Slim. It’s also a horizontal console unless you fork out for a vertical stand.</p>

<h3>A partial PS5 Pro spec sheet</h3>
<p>Mark Cerny did not provide a full spec sheet, but this is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/ps5-reveal-list-games-playstation-5-date-specs-everything/">an extension of the base PS5</a>. In other words, it will still have the same 8 core Zen 2 CPU (potentially clocked a little bit higher), 16GB of RAM, us the Tempest 3D AudioTech engine, allow you to slot in an extra NVMe drive, and more. The console is roughly the same height as the original PS5, with the width of the PS5 Slim.</p>

<p>Here’s where it’s improved and upgraded:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>GPU</strong></td>
<td>60 Compute Units – 67% increase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>AI Upscaling</strong></td>
<td>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Memory</strong></td>
<td>16 GB GDDR6 at 573GB/s – 28% increase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Internal Storage</strong></td>
<td>2TB built-in NVMe SSD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Optical Drive</strong></td>
<td>Optional Ultra HD Blu-ray (sold separately)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Video Output</strong></td>
<td>Up to 4K at 120Hz, 8K, VRR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Wireless Network</strong></td>
<td>Wi-Fi 7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The 67% increase in GPU compute units, fed by a 28% increase in RAM speed allows for roughly 45% increase in GPU performance. However, there’s much more to it than that.</p>
<p>The enhanced GPU also comes alongside improved ray-tracing that can offer 2-3x the performance of the base PS5. It’s not clear if this is entirely down to the GPU, or if it’s going hand-in-hand with the PSSR processor. Still, that’s quite an impressive bump.</p>
<p>But what does this all mean for your gaming?</p>
<h3>Graphical improvements with PS5 Pro</h3>
<p>Developers will be able to use all of this power in a number of ways. Mark Cerny stated that Sony’s goal was to effectively remove the need for graphics modes, so numerous games will be upgraded to provide Fidelity Mode graphics at Performance Mode frame rates – examples included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5/">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a>.</p>
<p>Already performant games can alternatively push enhanced visual effects into the games. Gran Turismo 7, for example, will now be able to render ray-traced reflections during races, when these were previously limited to replays. This will likely be the new Fidelity vs. Performance mode toggle.</p>
<h2>PS5 Pro game upgrades</h2>
<p>The games already confirmed to have native PS5 Pro enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon’s Souls</li>
<li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/06/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/horizon-forbidden-west-review-ps5-ps4/">Horizon Forbidden West</a></li>
<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, enhanced games will be marked with a PS5 Pro Enhanced label.</p>
<h3>PS5 Pro backward compatibility enhancements</h3>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancements are not limited to games with native support and updates. The console is fully compatible to the library of PS5 and backward compatible PS4 games available on standard PS5, and you can leverage it in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PS5 Pro Game Boost</strong> – this can be applied across all PS4 and PS5 games, using the GPU power to stabilise or improve performance of games, similar to the PS4 Pro Game Boost feature back in the day. With many games featuring dynamic resolution and now variable refresh rate modes, this will be a great de facto upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Image Quality </strong>– Available for “select PS4 games”, the PS5 Pro will seemingly be able to use PSSR to upscale the PS4 image to higher resolutions. This will be most useful for early generation PS4 games, which were not enhanced for PS4 Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly there doesn’t seem to be an effort to do Xbox-style game injection, which would have potentially been able to replace FSR and FSR 2 upscaling with PSSR, but it’s possible that this could be added in a firmware update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-the-dark-horizon-is-the-third-and-final-dlc-out-on-september-24/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Gunfire Games and Arc Games announced the release date for Remnant II: The Dark Horizon, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-gets-third-dlc-delay-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final DLC</a> scheduled for Remnant II: September 24.</p>
<p>In The Dark Horizon, players will return to N'Erud and discover a mysterious place preserved in time, where alien farmlands are tended by robots for long-dead inhabitants. But time corrupts everything, and rogue AI and robotic creations are now threats to travelers searching for the secrets of a colossal being that dominates the skyline. Players will uncover the secrets within the necropolis world of N'Erud. Moreover, as they enter this new overworld, they'll find new dungeons, experience a new glider traversal system not found elsewhere, acquire a new archetype, The Warden, meet unexpected allies, and face new threats.</p>
<p>The glider traversal system lets players choose which parts of the overworld they want to explore, including how to face the new world boss. As for The Warden, the new archetype uses a fully automated Drone that can shield, heal, or even attack enemies, making it the perfect partner on the battlefield. Remnant II: The Dark Horizon will also add many items and powerful weapons, including new items such as amulets and rings. When it comes to boss fights, fans can expect mysterious threats and survivors of unknown origin to emerge from the long-extinct civilization, with rogue AI and robotic creations lurking around every corner, posing new challenges for all players.</p>

<p>Beyond the Dark Horizon, Remnant II will also get a free update on the same day. The highlight of the patch is undoubtedly the new Boss Rush game mode. As suggested by the name, Boss Rush lets players get right into the action with bosses. The mode is playable either solo or with fellow travelers via multiplayer, and players may choose from three difficulty levels - Triple Threat (a three-boss run), Trial by Fire (a seven-boss run), and The Gauntlet (a nineteen-boss run).</p>
<p>The mode's goal is simple yet extremely challenging: successfully battle hordes of enemies, including an Aberration, to face bosses and earn drops. Along the way, players will earn temporary buffs during the run that grant stat bonuses and/or powerful passive bonuses that will prove helpful. To access Boss Russ, they can go to the World Stone in Station 13 and select the mode, similar to selecting Campaign or Adventure).</p>

<p>In addition to the new game mode, the free Remnant II content update will also introduce a new system called Prisms. Prisms are a new feature of the rebalanced fragment system and can be leveled up to grant additional stat bonuses.</p>

The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">official PlayStation blog says</a> PS5 Pro Game Boost “may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games.” It also said that the Pro’s “enhanced image quality” can improve the resolution for certain PS4 games.</p><p>Sony shared a short, non-comprehensive list of games that will receive free patches to take advantage of the Pro’s graphical and performance features. The games that will be noted with a “PS5 Pro Enhanced” label include:</p><div><ul><li><em>Alan Wake 2 </em></li><li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em></li><li><em>Demon’s Souls</em></li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma II</em></li><li><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></li><li><em>Gran Turismo 7 </em></li><li><em>Hogwarts Legacy </em></li><li><em>Horizon Forbidden West </em></li><li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 </em></li><li><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></li><li><em>The Crew Motorfest </em></li><li><em>The First Descendant </em></li><li><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em></li></ul></div><p>We don’t know how games not optimized for the Pro will look on the system.

            <p>Grand duchess of first-person factory sims Satisfactory has finally hit 1.0 on PC after five years in early access, introducing a "full narrative overhaul" together with some new alien technology which you can witness and boggle at via the 1.0 launch trailer, below. They've also announced a console version, but we don't care for such things. The only Satisfactory console I care about is the one that lets you deactivate the fog so you can obtain an unmurky view of your glittering conveyor belt empire.</p><!--more-->

<p>If you're new to Satisfactory, it's about turning a perfectly blameless alien planet into a gleaming and grinding network of production lines. You're a "Pioneer" working on behalf of the illustrious FICSIT Inc, who need you to extract and process any resources worth noting and send it up the Space Elevator for the purposes of the Save The Day program. It's possible that FICSIT Inc aren't quite what they're cracked up to be, but hush now -  you're here to ensure a steady flow of matter into the refinery, not think about "worrying undertones". Or even "worrying overtones" - Satisfactory's satire of space capitalism isn't exactly subtle.</p>
<p>‌Back in 2020, Rock Paper Shotgun's own far-future Dickensian habitat despoiler Brendan Caldwell deemed Satisfactory a ruddy good time. And also, a relatively laidback one given a sufficient quantity of spare leisure hours. "Everything can be twiddled and tweaked to make an assembly line run with utmost efficiency, or even slowed down to half speed, to make output steadier and avoid clogged conveyor belts," he wrote in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-review-early-access">Satisfactory early access review</a>. "But the opposite is also true. You can, like me, play the whole thing by ear. Make a shitty factory. It's fine. You're the only human on the planet, no one is going to fire you." It's just as well, Brendy, because that "needless, kilometre-long pipeline" sounds like it might have earned you a few weeks' suspension without pay. </p>
<p>Satisfactory has come a ways since Brendy stunk up the early access build with his excess plumbing. The 1.0 version adds various technologies, including endgame Portals "for near-instantaneous transportation across the vast alien lands", though this requires "huge power capacity" and access to Singularity Cells. Dimensional Depots, meanwhile, "offer an efficient option for inventory management" powered by Strange Alien Matter. I am guessing they let you store things in alternate dimensions. You also have more power to customise your uniform, with a range of colours, helmets, tool trinkets and skins. Nothing like a powerdrill pendant to keep your mind on the job and not on why you're reducing an Edenic paradise to a maze of smokestacks.</p>
<p>We have written many a thing about Satisfactory over the years - here's Alex Wiltshire (RPS in Minecraft) recounting how developers Coffee Stain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-satisfactorys-developer-tricked-their-audience-and-why-their-audience-loved-it">lied about pipes</a>, and here's Brendy again <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cars-in-videogames">praising the golfcart</a>. Personally, I've only ever sunk a piffling 10 hours into the early access build. I engineered some kind of logjam involving smelters and couldn't be arsed to fix it. This is my cue to start afresh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony today announced the PlayStation 5 Pro, a mid-generation hardware upgrade that will play the same game library as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">2020's PlayStation 5</a>, but with higher frame rates and better resolution than on the original system. The new units will be available on November 7 for $700, Sony said.</p>
<p>The updated hardware will come complete with 2TB of solid-state storage (up from 1TB on the original PS5), but without an Ultra HD Blu-Ray disc drive, which users <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">can purchase as an add-on accessory for $80</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8">a video presentation Tuesday</a>, Sony's Mark Cerny said PS5 developers "desire more graphics performance" in order to deliver the visuals they want at a frame rate of 60 fps. The lack of enough graphical power on the PS5 leads to a difficult decision for players between the higher resolution of "fidelity" mode and the smoother frame rates of "performance" mode (with three-quarters of players choosing the latter, according to Cerny).</p>
<p>The goal of the PS5 Pro, Cerny says, is delivering "the graphics that the game creators aspire to, at the high frame rates players typically prefer." To do this, the new system will sport a larger GPU that can support "up to 45 percent faster rendering," Cerny said, with 67 percent more compute units and 28 percent faster video RAM than the PS5. This will allow for "almost fidelity-like graphics at 'performance' frame rates" of 60 frames per second in many existing PS5 games, Cerny said.</p>

                    The two sides of this comparison are supposed to look comparable in fidelity, but the PS5 Pro is running at 60 fps, as opposed to 30 fps on the PS5.                  </p>

<p>The PS5 Pro will also bring what Cerny says is a "streamlined and accelerated approach" to ray-tracing, with individual rays calculated at "double or even triple the speeds of PlayStation 5." In examples shown on video, Cerny highlighted how reflections between cars are now available at 60 fps for <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> on the PS5 Pro, and how games like <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> could have more realistic shadow effects.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>An "AI library" called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) will be available on the PS5 Pro to automatically upscale in-game scenes as well. Cerny highlighted how this can make distant crowds in a game like <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to look much clearer.</p>
<p>Titles that can take advantage of the PS5 Pro's more powerful GPU will be marketed as "PS5 Pro Enhanced." Titles that will sport that designation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Alan Wake 2</em></li>
<li><em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em></li>
<li><em>Demon’s Souls</em></li>
<li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></li>
<li><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em></li>
<li><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></li>
<li><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></li>
<li><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></li>
<li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></li>
<li><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></li>
<li><em>The Crew Motorfest</em></li>
<li><em>The First Descendant</em></li>
<li><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Other titles will be able to take advantage of "PS5 Pro Game Boost," which Sony says "may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games."</p>
<h2>PS5.5</h2>
<p>The upgrade follows the history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">the PS4 Pro</a>, which launched almost exactly three years after the PS4 and offered the capacity for higher resolutions, faster frame rates, or both in many PS4 library games. The PS5 Pro comes further into the lifecycle for Sony's latest console, though, and at a point where Sony has yet to lower <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/is-the-us-market-ready-to-embrace-a-500-game-console/">the $500 launch price</a> for the console and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">increased the price of the disc-drive-free Digital Edition</a> last year (though inflation has taken some of the sting out of that nominal pricing).</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro comes after last year's launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/ps5-slim-teardowns-suggest-same-chip-not-much-shrinking-but-nifty-disc-drive/">a redesigned PS5 "Slim" model</a>, which reduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-playstation-5-looks-to-be-the-biggest-game-console-ever-made/">the original PS5's famously massive bulk</a> while keeping the internal processing power the same while</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to show any sign of plans for a similar update for the Xbox Series X/S, which also launched in late 2020. Earlier this year, though, Microsoft announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/microsoft-reveals-first-disc-less-xbox-series-x/">the first disc-drive-free edition of the Xbox Series X</a> for this holiday season.</p>
<p>Nintendo, which launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">a Switch with an improved OLED screen in 2021,</a> is widely expected to launch a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/controller-maker-says-switch-2-will-be-backward-compatible-with-all-switch-games/">backward- compatible</a> follow-up to the Switch <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">in 2025</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Michael Myers was previously introduced into Call of Duty: Ghosts as a playable character who was a reward for completing a challenge on the Fog DLC map. This time the horror icon looks to be returning as an operator bundle. Other Halloween-themed operators are teased for this year's The Haunting, including the scarecrow from Trick 'R Treat and the clown from the Terrifier movies. The trailer also showcases a demonic, three-headed operator skin for Ghost, and Makarov has a terrifying grin that looks very much related to the Smile movie.</p><p dir="ltr">More information on Season 6 should be revealed in the coming days. The new season of Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone should bring the usual offerings of a brand-new battle pass, more seasonal challenges, and game modes.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, Activision has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-campaign-early-access-activision-confirms/1100-6526378/">Black Ops 6 will not have a campaign early-access period</a>.

		<p>With today’s PS5 Technical Presentation, Sony’s console Lead Architect Mark Cerny has revealed the PlayStation 5 Pro, detailing the enhanced and more powerful mid-generation upgrade to the PS5.</p>
<p>The presentation also confirms that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> will launch on 7th November 2024, costing $700 / £700 /€800 / ¥120,000. A disc drive is not included, but is an optional £100 add-on. A vertical stand is also an add-on at £25. Pre-orders will go live on 26th September 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Technical Presentation hosted by Mark Cerny" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X24BzyzQQ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 Pro improves on the base PS5 in every measure. There is a bump in CPU performance, faster RAM, and a big boost to GPU performance up to 45% faster thanks to being 1.6 times the size, which should bring the 4K60 dreams that most gamers seem to have a bit closer to reality. The new generation of GPU will also bring enhanced ray tracing capabilities.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;native 4K is still going to be pretty unlikely – that’s just no how games work anymore – and so Sony has also developed a custom in-house upscaling technique called PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling). This aims to be best in class, going up against DLSS 3, FSR 3, XeSS and other temporal upscaling techniques.</p>

<p>The intention is to remove the decision between Fidelity and Performance modes. The examples used were of The Last of Us Part 2, Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart, giving Fidelity Mode graphics but at double the performance with 60FPS.</p>
<p>Advanced Ray Tracing will allow Gran Turismo 7 to bring ray tracing live in the races, as opposed to locking them to replays. Third party developers are also getting in on the act, with Hogwarts Legacy bringing greater reflections into the world.</p>
<p>Games enhanced for the new console will get a ‘PS5 Pro Enhanced’ label, while support is being added to:</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Demon’s Souls, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Forbidden West, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, The Crew Motorfest, The First Descendant, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and more.</p>
<p>Even without native support, PS5 Pro Game Boost will be able to improve performance across the full range of PS5 and backward compatible PS4 games. Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to apply PSSR to the older games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-5-update-available-now-adding-three-new-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-0-adds-penacony-realm-on-february-6/">Honkai: Star Rail</a> is now available for players to dive into, where they will finally be able to uncover the secrets of the Shackling Prison, experience the Wardance ceremony, and be introduced to powerful adversaries. Honkai: Star Rail version 2.5 also introduces three new characters for players to learn about. These characters are Feixiao, Lingsha and Moze, adding a new level of excitement to the game. For those who played Honkai: Star Rail 2.4, players were left on an intense cliffhanger, which will now be resolved in version 2.5, where players can continue the main questline and see more of the Xianzhou Luofu arc.</p>
<p>Version 2.5 of Honkai: Star Rail adds a lot to the game, especially with players finally getting to reach the climax of the silkpunk saga taking place in the Shackling Prison. A special Warp Event will take place to celebrate the first half of version 2.5, where players can pull for Robin, Black Swan, and Kafka. The Warp count for the guaranteed 5-star will be shared across rerun and current limited banners.</p>
<p>For those who want to get stuck into the Honkai: Star Rail 2.5 update, the update is already out across the globe. The update lasted five hours, but Honkai: Star Rail maintenance typically ends after four hours. Players get 300 Stellar Jade as compensation to make up for the downtime.</p>
<p>The official Honkai: Star Rail YouTube channel has also released a trailer that is just over two minutes long to showcase some of the storylines and characters players can expect to see in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Version 2.5 Trailer — &quot;Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue&quot; | Honkai: Star Rail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMHigW8mq9g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are three new storylines, one of which is the continuation of Xianzhou Luofu- Finest Duel Under the Pristine Blue. This quest becomes permanently available after the update, with Trailblazers having to be Level 21 or above, as well as completing the prerequisite quests.</p>
<p>As stated above, there will also be a quest line for the Luminary Wardance, which also requires a Trailblaze Level 21 or above. For a more casual experience, there is also the Festive Revelry to participate in, which gives you access to traditional Luofu mini-games so you can take a break after participating in high stress questlines.</p>
<p>For those who would like to read the full patch notes of the "Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue" version 2.5 update for Honkai: Star Rail, they have released a <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/125792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that details enemies added, as well as quality-of-life improvements to make the game more enjoyable for players. The update will end in October, giving players plenty of time to wrap up any loose ends from 2.5.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-officially-announced-launching-in-november.976986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Looks like the rumors were true. During today's PlayStation Technical Showcase, Mark Cerny and Sony officially announced the PS5 Pro, and while it'll represent a substantial power increase over the PS5, that increase will come with a cost.</p>
<p>The showcase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-technical-presentation-ps5-pro-possible-reveal">was announced yesterday</a>, and prior to that, rumors were swirling that Sony would announce the PS5 Pro during the show. That's exactly what they've done, and lead architect Mark Cerny says it's "the most powerful console" Sony has ever built. It's arriving in November.</p>
<p>During the showcase, Cerny points out that when faced with a choice between Fidelity and Performance modes, Performance mode is chosen around 75% of the time. Cerny says he and Sony want to make that choice easier for players by upping the power of the PS5.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the PS5 Pro will focus on what Cerny calls "the big three" technical improvements: a larger-capacity GPU, advanced ray tracing capabilities, and a proprietary AI upscaling method that should make images look sharper and crisper.</p>
<p>According to Cerny, the PS5 Pro's GPU will offer up to 45% faster rendering than the standard PS5, while advanced ray tracing tech delivers results up to twice or three times as fast as the current base PS5 model.</p>
<p>As for that AI upscaling tech, it's called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, and it works in a similar way to existing tech like Nvidia's DLSS or AMD's FSR, analyzing game images and upscaling them using AI technology.</p>
<p>We got to see a number of examples of games running on the new PS5 Pro, and the machine does look pretty impressive, although I'd imagine that you'd need to see both running side-by-side for several minutes to really appreciate the differences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-pro-big-three.jpg?itok=QfSKhFCu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-pro-big-three.jpg?itok=ttVn-_d2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro is targeting three main pillars of improvement over the PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>Cerny says that PS5 Pro support will be added to new games and existing titles alike, and games like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, and <i>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</i>were shown.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this extra power comes at a price; the PS5 Pro will cost $699.99, so you'd better be sure you really need the improvements it's offering before you open your wallet.</p>
<p>There's another caveat that might sour the deal for you; the PS5 Pro will launch without a disc drive, so if you want one, you'll have to buy the one that Sony is selling separately. That feels like it's going to be a dealbreaker for a lot of people.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7th, both at participating retailers and via PlayStation Direct. You'll be able to preorder it starting from September 26th.</p>

But if you want to play your physical games on the new console, you’ll have to pay extra: a disc drive isn’t included, so you’ll have to buy and install one separately for an additional $79.99.</p><p>“PS5 Pro is available as a disc-less console, with the option to purchase the currently available Disc Drive for PS5 separately,” Sony’s Hideaki Nishino <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">writes in a PlayStation Blog post</a>. That means if you are buying both the console and the disc drive together, you’ll be paying a whopping $779.98.</p><p>While very annoying — it sure seems like an expensive “Pro” console should come with a disc drive! — this move from Sony isn’t entirely out of left field.

After months of leaks, Sony just announced a more powerful PS5 console during a special <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX24BzyzQQ-8">technical presentation</a>. Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS5 console, says the PS5 Pro improves on the original console in three key ways: a larger GPU, advanced ray tracing, and custom AI-driven upscaling.</p><p>The PS5 Pro <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">will launch</a> on November 7th, priced at $699.99, and it looks similar to the slim version of the PS5 — just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">recent leaks</a> suggested it would. It has three stripes down the side, and it doesn’t come with a disc drive. You’ll be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">purchase a 4K Blu-ray disc drive separately</a> and optional console covers.</p><p>“It’s the most powerful console we’ve ever built,” says Cerny. The hardware upgrades inside will result in 45 percent faster rendering, according to Cerny, and should improve the detail of certain games and frame rates. One of the key reasons for the PS5 Pro is to allow PS5 Pro players to not have to choose performance modes over fidelity ones. “Players are choosing performance about three-quarters of the time,” says Cerny.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>The new PlayStation 5 Pro, next to the </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23831415/new-ps5-model-removable-disc-drive-sony-price-release-date"><em>current standard PS5</em></a><em>, and a DualSense controller.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>Sony has upgraded the GPU inside the PS5 Pro with 67 percent more compute units than the current PS5 console, and it has 28 percent faster memory, too. That all adds up to the 45 percent faster rendering of games and the ability to improve frame rates in titles without having to lose visual fidelity.</p><p>This extra power should also improve ray-traced games, with Sony suggesting that developers will be able to allow “the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.”</p><p>The PS5 Pro also includes Sony’s new AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) feature, which is essentially an upscaling technique similar to Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR to improve frame rates and image quality for PlayStation games. This custom PSSR upscaling is designed to replace a game’s existing temporal anti-aliasing or upsampling implementation. </p><p>Cerny briefly demonstrated a few games running on the PS5 Pro, including <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> with more detail while still targeting 60fps instead of the 30fps fidelity mode on PS5. Sony’s goal of fidelity-like graphics at performance frame rates will be available in games like <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>.&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>These are screenshots of Sony’s 4K resolution YouTube stream, and so many not show the full quality difference — but you get the idea.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshots by The Verge / Images by Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>Sony is also including a PS5 Pro “Game Boost” option, which will apply to more than 8,500 backward-compatible PS4 games for the PS5 Pro. “This feature may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games,” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">says Hideaki Nishino</a>, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s platform business group. “Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games.”</p><p>The PS5 Pro will also support Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, VRR, and 8K resolutions, and<em> CNET</em>’s Scott Stein, who got <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-pro-hands-on-sonys-699-turbo-console-hits-in-november/">an early hands-on with the console</a>, says it now comes with a larger 2TB solid-state drive and swaps one of its rear USB-A ports for an extra USB-C port instead. It’ll also still include an extra SSD slot for expansion, too, he says.</p><p>Games will need to be patched to take advantage of some of the PS5 Pro’s features, and Sony says developers are readying free software updates to existing titles that will be labeled as PS5 Pro Enhanced games — up to 50 of them by its November 7th launch, according to <em>CNET</em>. </p><p>The first PS5 Pro Enhanced games will include <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <em>Demon’s Souls</em>, <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, <em>The Crew Motorfest</em>, <em>The First Descendant</em>, and <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered. </em></p><p>Of the initial batch of titles, most should now simply feature 4K resolution and 60fps frame rate, but <em>CNET</em> also got to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> in a new 8K mode and a 4K ray-tracing mode. Developers can also reportedly add volumetric lighting or even show you more characters in the background of a scene.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is also compatible with the PlayStation VR2 headset — where Cerny told <em>CNET</em> it would eventually support higher-resolution games — the PlayStation Portal handheld, and existing PS5 controllers. Sony says it’s not changing the UI or network services for the PS5 Pro, so those will be identical to the existing console.</p><p>Preorders for the PS5 Pro will start on September 26th, ahead of the launch at retailers on November 7th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>First up, the team detailed the unique campaign mechanic for each of the three upcoming legendary lords. For Orc Gorbad, that’s “Da Plan”. Lead designer Sean Macdonald describes it as “Gorbad experimenting with what different units in the roster can he pull together.” The example he gives is “send out some goblins in front of the archers and they can pick up the arrows. And it's like, well, now you've got a way to regenerate your ammunition during the battle.” To me, this sounds like various campaign and battle buffs you’ll get as you climb higher up the military chain, but we’ll see.</p>
<p>For Ogre Golfag Maneater, it’s all about contracts. “For the first time in Warhammer III we're trying to create a faction that plays like a mercenary," says Macdonald. You’ll take contracts from factions to fight others, but it sounds like this won’t affect your personal diplomatic relationship with the target faction. “We've created this new experience where he does kind of roam the world, taking on the jobs and beating up anyone he fancies."</p>
<p>For Khorne’s Skulltaker it’s…the taking of skulls, as it should be. “The whole idea of the feature is, seek out, you know, powerful characters, defeat them, claim some of their strength, and empower yourself even further so that you can become the ultimate Khorne champion," Macdonald explains.</p>
<p>As far as new units go, the team mention a generic savage orc shaman, Yhetees for the ogres, and two legendary heroes for Khorne: Scyla Anfingrimm and Skarr Bloodwrath. Elsewhere, there’s mention of tweaks for Kislev and Bretonnia mentioned, new magical items, and a new chaos invasion endgame event. Game Director Rich Aldrige also hints towards more weapon variants for some units, ala <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys">the boys</a>. And that’s all the Warhammer that’s fit to shout “Warhammer” at for now. See you at the next Warhammer. Warhammer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>According to Ukrainian government-run website United24 Media, Ukraine's armed forces are using Steam Decks to remote-control gun turrets in the course of the on-going war with Russia. The site has shared a video of a new turret system, ShaBlya, which was apparently developed by Ukrainian engineers and approved for mass production earlier this year.</p> <!--more-->
<p>As described in <a href="https://x.com/United24media/status/1832807607758623209">the video</a>, the system is designed for use against infantry and lightly armoured targets. It's not clear from the video how the system works in practice, but it looks like operators can view camera feeds from the turret and shoot at people and vehicles using the Steam Deck's built-in controls. Having done a bit of digging of my own, Ukraine's military appear to have been experimenting with the Steam Deck <a href="https://x.com/krides/status/1650573735168995329">since April 2023</a>. Valve have yet to acknowledge or comment on all this - I'll let you know if they do.</p>
<p>The footage is a reminder that the games industry and the military sector are heavily enmeshed. The overlap isn't just limited to military engineers hacking consumer devices - military technology and practices and video game development and production are entangled at many levels, in what has become a circular exchange of ideas and expertise. Game engine company Unity have taken on military contracts to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/unity-dogfight-simulation-air-force-kill-chain/">work on battlefield simulations for training purposes</a>. So have Bohemia Interactive, in addition to working on their own, fictitious yet "authentic" war simulations for consumer usage - their attention to detail has reached the point that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bohemia-warns-against-spread-of-fake-israelipalestinian-conflict-videos-actually-created-in-arma-3">people have successfully passed off videos of Bohemia games as real war footage</a>. The US military has a long history of adapting video game controller technologies to work with <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/tech-tactics/us-military-video-game-controllers-war/">drones, unmanned vehicles and submarines</a>.</p>
<p>Video games developers have, of course, borrowed ample material from the military sector, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">licensed guns in Call Of Duty</a> through the fact that Helldivers 2 is grounded in <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/helldivers-2/developers-military-conscription">its developers' experience of military service</a> to the many live service games that cast you as some kind of private military contractor. People Make Games recently published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaDXZ2MI-k">a comprehensive video on the subject</a> which is worth sitting through.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro on Tuesday, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with it came the revelation</a> that the price of the console will be $200 more than the base PS5.</p>



<p>If you want to buy a PS5 Pro, it’s going to cost you $699.99/£699.99. The original base PS5 costs $499.99/£479.99, and that includes a disc drive for the system. The digital-only base PS5 retails for just $449.99/£389.99</p>



<p>Should you still want a disc drive for physical media, you’ll have to spend another $80/£99.99 for the attachable disc drive. That’ll put the price of a PS5 Pro up near $800 and well over £800.</p>



<p>So, in some cases it’ll cost $200/£200 more whereas others could be looking at $350/£350 more.</p>



<p>As far as what you’ll get for the expensive console, you get the PS5 Pro system, a DualSense controller, and a copy of the four-year-old game Astro’s Playroom. Inside the console comes a 45% more powerful GPU, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling, and more advanced ray tracing. You can check out more details on the full specs of the PS5 Pro, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right here</a>.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7, 2024. Preorders open later this month.</p>
