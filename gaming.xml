            <p>Announced at this year's Geoffcom, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> is a new game courtesy of the vehicular bods behind MudRunner and SnowRunner. This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>RoadCraft looks to take Saber's expertise in tricky terrain, and how vehicles react to that tricky terrain, by plugging it into more of a management sim. This means it's more about pinging to and fro between your vehicles to repurpose mess into something pretty. You'll take control of bulldozers to clear blocked paths, use transporters to carry vehicles out of sticky situations, and use cranes to lift bits and bobs with utmost precision. I'm particularly enamoured by the idea of spreading "hot asphalt using your paver", then flattening it with a roller. There's no way this isn't the most satisfying thing in video games.</p>

<p>And as it's construction-based, you'll harvest resources like sand, wood, or tar to make the terrain suitable for your iron fleet. "Supply factories and sand quarries to ensure a continuous production of resources needed for roads and bridges", says the press release. You might notice in the trailer, too, but you'll also need to plot routes on a map so your vehicles don't get in each other's way. This suggests there's an element of automation in the resource gathering side of things, alongside having direct control of vehicles. Only time will tell if you can whizz into the driver's seat of <em>any</em> vehicle, or whether that's reserved for a more specific thing.</p>
<p>The game's due out sometime in 2025 and you can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104890/RoadCraft/">Steam</a>.</p>

Adapted from a similarly named sci-fi novel by author Dmitry Glukhovsky, it didn’t quite take the world by storm, but the story-driven FPS about a community trying to survive the nuclear apocalypse by hiding in the subway stations and tunnels of Moscow earned enough love to spawn a franchise. Releasing over the 2010s, the <em>Metro </em>series became the loving torchbearer of janky “weird fiction” shooters after the long hiatus of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">now-returning <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>series</a></span>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,196049,196163" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The entirety of the <em>Metro </em>trilogy is on a pretty steep sale right now on Steam, while select titles from the series are cheap on other platforms.<strong> You can pick up the whole series, including </strong><em><strong>Metro 2033</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em><strong> Metro: Last Light</strong></em><strong>, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979"><em><strong>Metro Exodus</strong></em></a></span><strong> (and its expansion pass) for just over $9 on Steam. On PlayStation, you can also pick up remasters of both <em>2033</em> and <em>Last Light</em> for $3 apiece.</strong></p><p>The <em>Metro </em>series was developed by 4A Games, which consisted of a lot of ex-developers from the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>series, and they share a lot of the same DNA. Both take place in the fallout of nuclear apocalypses in Russia and both are survival games that blend sci-fi and supernatural elements. Whereas <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>has been more traditionally open-ended though, taking place in the fallout of a second Chernobyl disaster in a region only known as the Zone, the <em>Metro </em>games were far more linear and story-focused. </p><p><em>Metro </em>focuses on the life of Artyom, a young man who comes into his own as a ranger in the Moscow Metro. Throughout the first two games, he investigates beings known as the Dark Ones while trying to navigate the conflicts between the varying districts of survivors that call the underground home. These first two titles, <em>2033 </em>and <em>Last Light</em>, are often lauded for their tremendous and claustrophobic atmosphere, with most missions occurring in the insufferably dark tunnels under Moscow. On occasion, missions take place above-ground, where the players must don equipment to protect themselves from radiation damage, mutated creatures, and supernatural phenomena and anomalies, all while constantly maintaining the equipment keeping them alive.<br></p><p>This maintenance explodes into a whole crafting system in the third game, <em>Exodus</em>, which is my favorite of the trilogy. Abandoning the cluttered tunnels of Russia, Artyom, his wife Anna, and a party of allies hop onboard a train and explore the rest of war-ravaged Europe—along the way, <em>Exodus </em>becomes <em>much </em>more like <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R</em>. It shuttles you between hostile open environments and tasks you with crafting the tools of your survival, including gas masks and ammo, and strips the series’ UI elements to make an entirely diegetic interface.<br></p><p>For example, the compass you use is on Artyom’s wristwatch, which also counts down the use of minute-long air filters for his mask. Speaking of the gas mask, it can crack from firefights and needs to be sealed with duct tape and eventually repaired in order to be operable. Rifles are gas-pumped and shoot bullet-like pellets you craft from scarce materials! You spot points of interest with your binoculars and mark them in a map that Artyom needs to manually pull out. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8geGHbWIMXA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8geGHbWIMXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many have said before</a></span>, <em>Exodus </em>has the most tremendous sense of place, and for what it’s worth, it is <em>the </em>most immersive game I’ve played.</p><p>I love <em>Exodus </em>and still think so fondly about how much it forces you to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979">consider and take care of your stuff</a></span>. Even if I don’t remember every name of its cast, the tender moments they share in their personal cars onboard the Aurora have stayed with me for longer than I thought possible. The gunplay is fraught with tension as you weigh the challenge ahead against your scarcity of supplies. Even if it doesn’t always come together due to bugs and a level of polish that are emblematic of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/eurojank&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/eurojank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eurojank</a></span>” titles of the era like the <em>Metro </em>and<em> S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>series, it’s ambitious and I can’t fault it for shooting for the stars.</p><p>Ahead of the release of <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>this fall, I can’t think of a better game series to play. <em>Exodus </em>is the longest but can still be wrapped up in about 30 hours if you try and do everything on offer. And I encourage you to because <em>Exodus </em>is a gorgeous game that’ll stick with you for some time if my own experience is any indication. The first two games are about 10-15 hours each, so you could spend a month of your downtime picking at them and be ready for <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2</em>’s launch in November. Run, don’t walk, to pick up these games, and you’re welcome in advance. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The preview version goes live today for players who are members of the Xbox Insiders initiative, with more games being added to the Game Pass Standard library throughout the preview period. So while we still don’t know exactly which games will be included in that tier of the program at launch, players should get a better idea in the days and weeks ahead. </p><p>But the biggest question is still how long it will take for new games to get added to Standard. Earlier this summer, Microsoft announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059">it was hiking the price of Game Pass Ultimate</a></span> and creating a new tier called Standard that wouldn’t get big games that hit Game Pass on day one of release, one of the big selling points of the service since its inception. So while Standard is $15 a month instead of Ultimate’s $20 a month, it won’t be getting <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em>’s <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> expansion the day they come out. </p><p>“Some games coming to Game Pass Ultimate (day one games or other game entries) will not be immediately available with Game Pass Standard and may be added to the library at a future date (can be up to 12 months or more and will vary by title),”  senior community lead Megan Spurr wrote over at Xbox Wire today. “We’ll continue to share with all Game Pass members when games are being added and available to play for each plan.”</p><p>It’s unclear if this waiting period will be announced for each game ahead of release, or will be its own sort of mystery exclusivity period that fans have to speculate about when deciding if and when to subscribe to Standard vs. Ultimate. It’s also possible that third-party day-and-date games, like <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, could have launches that vary wildly across both tiers. Pardon the pun but it sounds anything but “standard.” </p><p>This big shift in Game Pass comes ahead of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s release in October, the first game in the hit multiplayer shooter series to get a day-and-date release on a subscription gaming service, and likely the best-selling game yet that will have appeared on Game Pass. That’s in stark contrast to last year when Xbox owners could play <em>Starfield</em> for a whole month starting the day it came out for just $11. Its upcoming expansion, <em>Shattered Space</em>, will now require a $20 monthly subscription instead. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Handle each object with realistic physics, accounting for their mass and size. Interact with elements like sand, wood, and asphalt. Reshape the terrain and ease the movement of your vehicles thanks to your newly-built roads.</p><p><strong>Expand Your Garage</strong></p><p>Each machine has its own behavior. Use your bulldozer to clear obstructions, your heavy transporter to carry multiple vehicles, or your fixed or gantry cranes to lift containers and equipment. Reconnect a factory to the power grid with your cable layer, lay down hot asphalt with your paver, and flatten it with your roller to create your own roads. Unlock over 40 vehicles as you progress through the story-driven campaign. Visit your garage to customize your machines with your company’s logo and repaint them with your personalized colors.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_907484"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Operate Worldwide</strong></p><p>Disasters have caused chaos, cutting off access to many affected areas.

                <p>InZoi--Krafton's wildly ambitious life-simulation game--seems poised to let you do almost anything, as anyone, and in a new Gamescom trailer, we got to see just how that can play out. You could experience the most joyful moments of someone's life or watch them at their very worst.</p><p>The trailer begins with a cat walking up an invisible set of steps before activating a device that seems to give them access to their own world. In-universe, we see friends chatting on the street, giving each other high-fives, and exchanging presents. Elsewhere, more-substantial events are taking place, such as a wedding, and we later see the same married couple interacting with their baby.</p>

      </div>
<p>It's not all sunshine and rainbows, naturally, as we see people slapping each other and angrily throwing garbage. A car accident results in both drivers blaming the other, and a novice cook starts an enormous fire in her home. For anyone familiar with The Sims, that one should feel right at home.</p><p>InZoi doesn't have a release date yet, but Krafton is offering the InZoi: Character Studio tool on Steam from August 21-26. Characters made using the detailed customization tools will then be usable once InZoi exits early access. </p>

Early footage shows the sequel looking like it borders on a character action game, so as someone who plays a mage in every single one of these games, I was curious how <em>The Veilguard</em> was going to adapt the spell-slinging class for that style of play. We now have our first look at the class in action, and it looks pretty sick.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Y’all tech nerds can enjoy that, but I’m more concerned with how the mage class operates in the more action-driven combat. <em>Dragon Age II</em> and <em>Inquisition</em> were certainly closer to full-blown action RPGs, but they still leaned at least somewhat into the original <em>Origins</em>’ tactical roots. <em>The Veilguard</em> has pivoted away from them entirely, and just how that would impact mages has been one of the biggest question marks hanging over the game. Now we see a mage Rook (the player character) using a staff, capable of both close-range combat and long-range spells. The mage seems to have a few tricks up their sleeve, with a close-range slam ability, what looks like a beam of green Fade-like magic to pester enemies from afar, and more powerful energy spells that can strike multiple enemies at once.</p><p>The standard attack has you flicking your staff as you fire nondescript damage spells, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1825926716755521581&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1825926716755521581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to BioWare executive producer Michael Gamble</a></span>, mage players will also be able to use an orb or dagger as their primary weapon instead of a staff. So it sounds like even this trailer is only showing off one way to play the mage. Check out the video below:</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692">on October 31</a></span>. Fans have been waiting for nearly a decade for the game, as it will finally pick up where <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>left off in 2015 with its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC.

"It will be used to create a quality assurance buffer, giving more time between testing and launch, ensuring we release the game when it's ready.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, and Silent Hill 2 are just some of the noteworthy releases on the gaming calendar, and between them, there are dozens of other games that could have potentially derailed the momentum of Bloodlines 2.</p><p>The game had a troubled development cycle after it was first announced, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-canceled-after-its-last-delay/1100-6497078/" data-ref-id="1100-6497078">and was almost canceled</a> after its original developer Hardsuit Labs was taken off of the project after yet another delay. The Chinese Room stepped in to take over and was officially confirmed to be leading the project several months later. The developer has been fairly active in showing off several of the new features in Bloodlines 2--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sticks-and-stones-and-words-can-hurt-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/1100-6525797/" data-ref-id="1100-6525797">like a dynamic dialogue system</a> that can alter gameplay significantly--and it has also fleshed out its vampiric underworld with quick glimpses of clans like the <a href="https://youtu.be/zcDEhivcr-w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ventrue</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/is1ktPTpGUA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brujah</a>, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/9gyzRvi3NTs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tremere</a>.</p><p>Set in Seattle, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will take players into the dark underbelly of a city on the brink of all-out war, and as an elder vampire, it'll be up to them to influence the outcome of this conflict between factions.</p>

PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 subscribers get the original PlayStation 2 version via an emulator, while Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One subscribers get the Scholarship Edition.</p><p>Here’s Rockstar’s explanation:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Players on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 can download and play the original PlayStation 2 version of Bully via the PlayStation 4 rerelease and PlayStation 5 backward compatibility</li><li>Players on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One can download and play Bully: Scholarship Edition via Xbox backward compatibility</li></ul><p>(Bully: Scholarship Edition contains missions, classes, clothing items, and two-player online mini-games not included in the original launch version of Bully.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>So, no remaster or fresh version of Bully then, which will come as some disappointment to fans. Bully is Rockstar Vancouver’s much-loved open-world juvenile delinquent sim that first launched in 2006 on PS2. A sequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-rockstar-developers-share-details-on-the-development-of-the-cancelled-bully-2"><u>was once in development at Rockstar’s New England studio in the late 2000s</u></a>, but obviously never came out. In November, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-waiting-in-the-wings-fans-find-possible-evidence-of-cut-gta-5-story-dlc-canned-bully-2"><u>the alleged leak of a database file for Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a> was found to include reference to the unreleased <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/bully-2"><u>Bully 2</u></a>, with some of its ideas making it into other Rockstar games like Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-gets-bully-and-la-noire-later-this-year-rockstar-teases-big-gta-online-update-this-summer">Rockstar said LA Noire is also coming to GTA+ later in 2024</a>, although there’s no release date yet. LA Noire is Team Bondi’s 2011 open-world game set in 1947 Los Angeles. As with Bully, fans have called for a sequel, although Team Bondi itself is no more.</p><p>All this comes with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a> looming over the horizon. Rockstar has said it will come out fall 2025. It has yet to say what will happen to the existing GTA Online when it does.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p> Game director Hiroshi Takai said that future Final Fantasies may launch on both PC and console day one.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-16-confirms-september-pc-release-date-director-says-its-possible-probably-even-likely-future-final-fantasy-games-launch-day-1-on-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Takai was asked whether future Final Fantasy games will get a day-one PC release. He responded, "I think it's possible--probably even likely," but then clarified, "That said, the team in charge of each project gets to decide its own policy, so this is just my personal opinion."</p><p>This PC port of Final Fantasy XVI comes over a year after the original game released. When asked whether the wait was worth it, Takai said, "Looking at the results, I think the time we've put into optimizing the game for PC was time well spent." </p><p>Square Enix has had some big shakeups recently. According to a financial report earlier in 2024, the company is seeking to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-is-rethinking-how-it-approaches-games-and-its-coming-at-a-huge-cost/1100-6523070/" data-ref-id="1100-6523070">more selective about which games it will develop</a>. This approach led to multiple titles being canceled, leading $140,000,000 in "content abandonment" losses, though Square Enix did not identify which games were affected.</p><p>The company has struggled with PC ports in the past. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-of-paradise-game-breaking-hair-has-been-fixed/1100-6503579/" data-ref-id="1100-6503579">Stranger in Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspoken-updates-coming-to-improve-performance-graphics-and-more/1100-6511306/" data-ref-id="1100-6511306">Forspoken</a> both got some big updates after launch to boost performance. In the interview Takai affirmed that the company "always listens to player feedback and bears it in mind." Square Enix is not the only company emphasizing PC ports. Sony is also launching some games day one on PC, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">waiting to port others</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-launches-on-pc-in-september-demo-out-now/1100-6525923/" data-ref-id="1100-6525923">Final Fantasy 16 is landing on PC</a> September 17, alongside both DLC (sold seperately).

            <p>Sony is pulling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> from its PS Plus subscription service in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The first-party Sony game is now listed under the 'Last Chance to Play' section on PS Plus, along with the likes of NieR Replicant, Marvel's Midnight Suns and Alien Isolation.</p>
<p>This upcoming removal of Forbidden West comes just a few months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">Horizon Zero Dawn was also removed from the service</a>, which as Tom wrote at the time seemed a surprising move by Sony.</p>

<p>The full list of games in the Last Chance to Play section of PS Plus are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West</li>
<li>Marvel's Midnight Suns</li>
<li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</li>
<li>Alien Isolation</li>

<p>Along with Forbidden West and - of course - Alien Isolation, I would fully recommend giving Marvel's Midnight Suns a go. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Eurogamer's own Marvel's Midnight Suns</a> review, Christian Donlan called it "great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse".</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-lineup-for-august">as previously announced</a> but highlighting it again here because I know how you all feel about TimeSplitters: the trilogy is now live in the PlayStation Plus Classics Catalogue. The games are also available to purchase via the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/search/timesplitters">PS Store for £7.99 each</a>.</p>

The new Game Pass Standard subscription includes the usual Game Pass library for Xbox but with online console multiplayer, too. Crucially, it doesn’t include immediate access to day-one game releases, though.</p><p>During the test period, Xbox Insiders will be able to access Xbox Game Pass Standard for just $1. “Any renewals during the preview period will also be $1 per month,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/xbox-insiders-everything-you-need-to-know-about-xbox-game-pass-standard/">says Megan Spurr</a>, senior community lead for Xbox Game Pass. Once this Standard tier launches fully, it will be priced at $14.99 per month.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Game Pass lineup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Microsoft is also providing some clarity on when day-one games and other titles will be available in the Standard tier. “Some games coming to Game Pass Ultimate (day one games or other game entries) will not be immediately available with Game Pass Standard and may be added to the library at a future date (can be up to 12 months or more and will vary by title),” says Spurr.</p><p>Microsoft first revealed its new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier in July, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">alongside price increases</a> for Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Microsoft has promised to launch Xbox Game Pass Standard in the “coming months.” The existing Xbox Game Pass for Console subscription will continue for current subscribers, but new Game Pass subscribers are no longer able to select the console option until the new Game Pass Standard subscription is available more broadly.</p><p>If you’re interested in testing Xbox Game Pass Standard for just $1, you can opt-in through the Xbox Insider Hub on an Xbox console. Microsoft says “current Game Pass Core members with two months or more on their membership or current Game Pass Ultimate members will not be able to participate in this flight.”</p><div>

Its first season introduced a magic system that begged to be explored, its ensemble cast was charming, and production studio Mappa’s action sequences delivered without fail. While the first half of season 2 undoubtedly has the series’ strongest writing, its latter half is marred by a barely-there story and shock-value character deaths that fail to serve as connective tissue for its raucous action sequences. Like Jimmy Fallon and authentic laughter, its story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-part-2-review-shibuya-incident-arc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-part-2-review-shibuya-incident-arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never truly comes together</a></span>. If anything, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> season 2 is an empty spectacle that does a significant disservice to the groundwork of its first season.<br></p><p>If season 2’s Shibuya Incident arc was the wheels coming off the bus, the anime’s upcoming Culling Game death tournament is <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> barreling down the street rolling on tire belts instead of rubber. Knowing that its manga will conclude in just five more chapters is more of a mercy for readers than something to lament. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-teaser-culling-game-1851134414&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-teaser-culling-game-1851134414"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> Season 3 Will Kick Off A Bloody Tournament Arc</a></span><br></p><p>The experience of reading <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> started as the first weekly updated Shonen Jump manga I’d eagerly dive into before shifting into the one I saved for last out of frustration with its monotony.<strong> </strong>It reached a point where reading <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> felt comparable to reading <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>’s<em> </em>going nowhere fast trashy romantic drivel—a misfortune I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. To talk around manga spoilers for anime-only viewers, the problem with <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s manga is as follows:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hard-to-follow action sequences</li><li>Mid-fight exposition dumps that would put <em>Bleach </em>to shame</li><li>An overcomplicated magic system that seemingly retcons itself with each passing week</li><li>Shock value character deaths and weaponized postpartum flashbacks</li></ul><p>Each passing chapter felt like cracking open an SAT prep notebook of power systems in order to keep track of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen’</em>s exposition-heavy battles that seemingly improvise and change up how attacks and counter-attacks work every week. Instead of feeling engaged by the kaleidoscope-esque reveals of the manga, I routinely threw my hands up in frustration and said, “Sure, whatever,” at every convoluted plot development.</p><p>If anything, the goodwill <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s action<em> </em>has earned from its fandom is due to the heavy lifting of Mappa’s overworked animation department, which articulates movement with clarity, weight, and immaculate imagery—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JuJutsuKaisen/comments/17vairi/jujutsu_kaisen_production_meltdown_continues/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JuJutsuKaisen/comments/17vairi/jujutsu_kaisen_production_meltdown_continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite the production meltdown its animators withstood</a></span> to make it happen. The manga’s portrayal of action, on the other hand, is uneven at best. While many of its two-page spreads are outstanding, the bulk of its action choreography made me squint to try and parse out the barely legible anatomy of fight scenes. This is further proven in the manga’s final battle(s), which see everything <em>and</em> the kitchen sink thrown at its titular villain, only for him to “Nuh-uh” his way out of insurmountable odds.<br></p><p>Unlike <em>My Hero Academia</em>’s manga, which concluded a month prior with a serviceable epilogue that tied most of its narrative loose threads together, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s conclusion in just five chapters all but assures a rushed ending to a story that–-if we’re being honest—never felt truly realized in the first place. If anything, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s ineffectual story serves simply as a vehicle to ferry viewers to the next fight scene. </p><p>All this to say, there’s still hope that season 3 won’t be as monotonous as its manga counterpart, seeing as how Mappa turned the narrative ship around with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/attack-on-titan-eren-jaeger-finale-ending-anime-manga-1850995603&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/attack-on-titan-eren-jaeger-finale-ending-anime-manga-1850995603"><em>Attack on Titan</em>’s controversial finale</a></span>. But as things stand, five chapters won’t be enough to turn <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> into an emotionally resonant manga with fully realized characters. It will, however, still make for good out-of-context AMV fight sequence fodder for TikTok, if that’s any consolation.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The caveat here is that all of those controllers also offer console support. The V3 Pro is a somewhat uncommon in this regard, but it's conceivable that not partnering with a console manufacturer contributed to keeping the price lower than we typically see.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of the OPS V3 Pro's features:</p><ul><li>Six remappable buttons (four on back, two on top)</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers</li><li>PowerA's Quick-Twist analog sticks with three different heights</li><li>Tactile mechanical switches for face buttons, D-pad, and shoulder buttons</li><li>Trigger locks with three stop points</li><li>Textured grip</li><li>Custom profiles</li><li>Multi-zone RGB lighting</li><li>Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless with USB-A dongle, and USB-C wired connections</li><li>Program, LED, and Profile buttons to cycle through settings on the fly</li><li>Magnetic charging stand with slot for USB dongle</li><li>Dual rumble motors</li><li>Turbo button</li><li>Up to 30-hour battery life</li><li>Magnetic charging stand with slot for USB dongle</li><li>PowerA HQ Windows app for further customization</li></ul><p>The OPS V3 Pro doesn't have any swappable parts, but it does have a rather unique feature with its Quick-Twist sticks. Just like it sounds, you can twist the analog sticks up or down and lock them in three different positions. Some players swap sticks specifically to put them at different levels--this is common in FPS games--so it's cool to see that implemented without the need to keep track of small components. That said, another reason to swap sticks is to use a different style cap (concave, convex, etc.). While that's missing here, you could add a pair of removable thumbstick caps to fit your preference--there are tons of third-party options that would fit these sticks.</p><p>PowerA used Hall Effect sensor technology to combat stick drift as well as to increase the durability of the triggers. Next to the triggers, you'll find two extra programmable buttons, which are joined by four programmable back buttons. Most pro-style controllers have four, and sometimes only two, extra inputs. The back buttons retain PowerA's usual boxy form factor, which could take some getting used to if you're experience is with the elongated paddle shape found on other controllers. It's a matter of preference, but paddles in general feel more intuitive and faster. Still, the four back buttons are placed in the best possible locations, as shown below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353352-poweraopsv3back.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353352" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353352-poweraopsv3back.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353352"></a><figcaption>PowerA's OPS V3 Pro has four remappable back buttons and two remappable shoulder buttons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353352-poweraopsv3back.png"></figure><p>Another notable feature of the OPS V3 Pro is its use of microswitches. Similar to Razer's Wolverine controllers, the face buttons, D-pad, and shoulder buttons actuate with microswitches instead of conventional membrane switches. This produces a clicky, mouse-like feel and promotes faster speeds. You won't find microswitches on the aforementioned Fortnite-themed controller.</p><p>You can remap inputs, cycle through profiles, and adjust the RGB lighting effects directly on the controller. PowerA also has a Windows app where you can tinker with input settings and layouts.</p><p>Trigger locks can be set at three different stopping points to increase or decrease pull distance. The V3 Pro also has rubberized, textured grips, a turbo button, and a rumble motor in each handle.</p><p>You'll get up to 30 hours of playtime on a single charge, and there's also an included magnetic charging stand (3-4 hours to fully charge). It connects to your PC via Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, or wired via a braided USB-C cable. Though designed with PC in mind, you can also use the OPS V3 Pro for mobile gaming.</p><p>PowerA sent us the OPS V3 Pro for testing, and we've been impressed by its feature set and performance so far. It's easily the most advanced controller in PowerA's crowded catalog. One thing that's immediately noticeable when holding the controller is that it gets weight <em>and </em>weight distribution right. One of the key reasons why the Elite Series 2 feels so great to use is because of how it distributes its relatively hefty weight. It simply adds to the premium feel. At 366g, the OPS V3 Pro is actually heavier than the Elite Series 2 (345g), but the weight is similarly well-distributed. Like with the Elite Series 2, this design helps give the OPS V3 Pro a high-end feel that matches its wealth of customization features. And that's quite impressive when you consider the price.</p><p>PowerA's OPS V3 Pro releases September 16. If primarily game on PC and aren't a huge Fortnite fan, the OPS V3 Pro seems like the better option versus PowerA's new Xbox/PC controller.</p><hr><h2>PowerA OPS V1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353351-poweraopsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353351" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353351-poweraopsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353351"></a><figcaption>PowerA OPS V1 - PC and mobile controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353351-poweraopsv1.png"></figure><ul><li>Price: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8T9222Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$50 at Amazon</a></li><li>Release Date: September 9</li></ul><p>At half the price of the OPS V3 Pro, it's not surprising that the OPS V1 isn't loaded with as many customization features or premium parts. But even though it's billed as an entry-level PC controller, it does have several welcome features you don't always see on $50 controllers.</p><ul><li>Four remappable back buttons</li><li>Program button to map inputs</li><li>Trigger locks with three stop points</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers</li><li>Dual rumble motors</li><li>Turbo button</li><li>Up to 20-hour battery life</li><li>Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, and USB-C wired connections</li></ul><p>If you've used one of PowerA's Enhanced controllers for Switch, the OPS V1 has a similar feel. It's much lighter than the V3 Pro at 269g and excludes the rubberized grips, so you can certainly notice the difference in quality.</p><p>A $50 controller with Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers, four remappable back buttons, and three-way trigger locks isn't all that common from a major brand.</p><p>In terms of competition, it makes sense to compare the OPS V1 to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate</a>, which is available in multiple different models, all of which work on PC and can be found for around $50 (sometimes less). The OPS V1 has the Ultimate beat in quantity of remappable inputs (four versus two), but the Ultimate's back buttons have a better feel to them. The Ultimate also lacks trigger locks, if this feature is important to you. 8BitDo's customization software has the OPS beat with its customization app, which also works on mobile devices. Depending on which model you pick, the Ultimate can also offer Switch or Xbox compatibility. The OPS V1, unlike the V3 Pro, doesn't come with a charging dock--and 8BitDo's charging stand is better than the OPS V3 Pro's dock if you want to display your controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353353-opsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353353" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353353-opsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353353"></a><figcaption> PowerA's OPS V1 controller has four remappable back buttons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353353-opsv1.png"></figure><p>Based on our testing, the OPS V1 doesn't hit the sweet spot of pro-style features <em>and </em>feel for a budget price as well as the 8BitDo Ultimate. But it must be said that the 8BitDo Ultimate is currently our pick for the best PC controller in 2024 because of its premium feel and well-integrated feature set.</p><p>The OPS V1 launching alongside the OPS V3 Pro, a controller that truly punches above its price, makes the impactful differences between them more noticeable. But if you want four remappable buttons and trigger stops in a $50 controller, the OPS V1 is a solid choice. Just know that the OPS V3 Pro is a big step up.</p><p>PowerA's OPS V1 releases on September 9. Along with the standard black model for $50, Amazon is taking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8T84XZ7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for a Fortnite-themed variant</a> for $55.</p><hr><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot received product samples from the manufacturer to test for review.</em></p>

            <p>
Paradox Interactive's streak of game delays continues with the news its Chinese-Room-developed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> is now targeting a release in the "first half of 2025", rather than its previously announced "late 2024" window.
</p>
<p>
In a post <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/whats-next-for-bloodlines-2">on its website</a>, Paradox called the delay a "proactive decision" derived from its commitment early this to deliver "high-quality games" to its players. "Though [Bloodlines 2] is in a good enough place that we could have maintained our planned release window," it continued, "Paradox and The Chinese Room collaboratively decided to prioritise polish."
</p>
<p>
Paradox says the delay will "create a quality assurance buffer, giving more time between testing and launch, ensuring we release the game when it's ready." More specifically, The Chinese Room will use the time to expand Bloodlines 2's story, providing twice as many endings as its predecessor, and to "adjust certain areas" such as Fabien - the voice in its protagonist's head.

<p>
The Chinese Rooms adds it'll continue sharing Bloodlines 2 details with fans in the run-up to its revised released next year, with future topics of discussion set to include social feeding, Seattle's different factions, some additional characters, and more. "It has been a long journey," Paradox's statement concluded, "but we're near the final stages of development and will share the release date once we are confident with the game’s level of polish."
</p>
<p>
Bloodlines 2 is, of course, far from the only game to be delayed by Paradox in recent times, with Prison Architect 2 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-launch-delayed-again">Cities: Skylines 2's console release</a> having both faced multiple delays. Paradox's Sims-like Life By You also saw repeated delays until the publisher made the shock decision to pull the plug on the project earlier this year, cancelling the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">closing its studio</a>.
</p>
<p>
Life By You's cancellation was just the latest in a string of high-profile disasters for Paradox in recent years. Bloodlines 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-says-it-almost-cancelled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-earlier-this-year">almost cancelled</a> before The Chinese Room stepped in after troubles at its original studio, while 2023's The Lamplighters' League was enough of a flop that Paradox opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split%20with%20developer%20Harebrained%20Schemes">part ways with its developer Harebrained Schemes</a>. And the ramfactions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">catastrophically premature launch</a> are still being felt, with Paradox having pledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">not to release any additional DLC</a> until its issues are addressed. In July, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">admitted</a> the publisher had "made the wrong calls in several projects".
