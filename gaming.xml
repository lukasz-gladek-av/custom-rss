            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend at GenCon, Wizards of the Coast dropped new information on their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Forgotten Realms supplements. They outlined what players can expect when returning to the most iconic setting in the enduring fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Forgotten Realms Supplement Preview</h2>

<p>As archived in a post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2032-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast has announced that the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms supplement will be broken up into two books: <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun</em>. Both of these supplements are for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</a>, also referred to as 5.5 Edition by the community.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=koCdasu7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=L06_98P8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun</em> focuses entirely on player options. The book will include information on regional factions like The Harpers and the Zhentarim, an overview of various locales for player backstories, and a bunch of new backgrounds feats, and subclasses like the Bladesinger Wizard and the Scion of the Three Rogue. The subclasses are notable since they appeared in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a> back in June.</p>

<p>Curiously, this new book includes a new mechanic called Circle Magic. The overview is brief, referring to it as "cooperative casting magic," but it does invite speculation.</p>

<p>The second <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms book, Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun, is all about DM materials. It will contain over 50 prewritten adventures for levels 1-15, five gazetteers on key areas of Faerun like Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate, over 50 quickplay maps, new monster and villain statblocks, and new magic items and bastions.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast has also included some digital exclusives with these books. Three digital supplements are being sold at an MSRP of $14.99. <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em>, which will include vampiric rules, an updated Dhampir player option, and a prewritten adventure featuring the titular vampire from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

The details on the third book are yet to be announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms books are available for pre-order. Both <em>Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Adventures in Faerun</em> are available in physical (MSRP $49.99), digital (MSRP $29.99) and physical and digital (MSRP $ 59.99) bundles. In addition, there is an Ultimate Bundle that includes digital and physical copies of both books, the digital expansions, and digital dice and maps for D&amp;D Beyond (MSRP $159.99).</p>

<p>The books are expected to release November 11.</p>

<p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> features a handful of secret characters to unlock. Some are immediately available to buy in the Secret Shop, like Michelangelo and <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804">Bam Margera</a>. Others are only added to the shop once you’ve completed a hidden objective. One of the most difficult to unlock is the fan-favorite Officer Dick, who is lovingly portrayed by Jack Black for the second time.</p> <p>You’ll need to explore the deep corners of each level before this skater can be added to your roster. Using <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140">Photo Mode</a> to scour the map can help, but this guide will save you a lot more time.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614521"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614521">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><b>To unlock Officer Dick, you’ll need to collect the hidden Panda plush in each level.</b> These can be harder to find than most Secret Tapes, since the latter has the benefit of being a giant floating item that’s highlighted to boot.</p> <p>Once you’ve collected them all, a familiar-looking skater named Constable Richard will be added to the Secret Shop for $5,000. Pay up the cash to unlock him and an alternate outfit with his iconic Officer Dick look.</p> <p>Let’s dive into where each plushie is located. We’re going in order from the first map of the third game to the last new map for the fourth game.</p> <h3><span id="foundry"></span>Foundry<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614522"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614522">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Head to the other side of the map from where you start. Build up some speed and jump off the half pipe here to catch a grind on the upper level. Hop off the edge and go to the leftmost corner to find the plush.</p> <h3><span id="canada"></span>Canada<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614523">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn around and go towards the giant tree surrounded by half pipes. On the other side of these and right next to the tree is the plush.</p> <h3><span id="rio"></span>Rio<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614524"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614524">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You want to turn right as soon as you can and head to the closest corner of the map. There will be a small opening with a fountain, and the plush can be seen directly across from it in the bushes.</p> <h3><span id="suburbia"></span>Suburbia<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614525">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This requires access to the haunted house that opens up after helping the Thin Man. Transfer over to the half-pipe-filled backyard and then reach the area behind the tree in the corner to get the plush.</p> <h3><span id="airport"></span>Airport<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614526"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614526">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Rush through the map until you get to the flight terminals. Go left to the C2 terminal that’s meant for Tokyo flights. Skate up the ramp in front and try to land behind the three monitors to easily access this plush.</p> <h3><span id="skater-island"></span>Skater Island<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614527">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Exit the building and head towards the overturned boat on your left. The plush will be found sitting on the other side of it.</p> <h3><span id="los-angeles"></span>Los Angeles<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614528">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Skate down the road to your right and then barrel through the fountain building’s glass windows. Transfer over the watery half pipe in front of you and venture into either hole to acquire this plush. If all you see are grates, you need to trigger the “They’re Grate” gap by grinding the rails nearby.</p> <h3><span id="tokyo"></span>Tokyo<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614529">©Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Panda is located in the hidden left area of the map, which you can access after grinding the top levels of the left side and collapsing the giant circle advertisement. Technically, the plush is directly beneath you in this new area. Jump off and venture towards either side to grind the edges of their half pipes. A separate path can be grinded close to the plush, but you’ll zoom past. I could only reach this one by awkwardly jumping towards it.</p> <h3><span id="cruise-ship"></span>Cruise Ship<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614530"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614530">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn right from the start and hop down to the lower level of the cruise ship. The plush is well-hidden up in the planters on the left side. Grind the rails above to reach them.</p> <h3><span id="college"></span>College<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614531">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>From the start, head left and grind up the barrier arm that leads up to the parking garage’s second level. Turn around and jump between the college-decorated wires, the purple rail on the right, and finally the roof of the white building ahead to collect this level’s plush.</p> <h3><span id="san-francisco"></span>San Francisco<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614533">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn left and keep skating until you reach the Pier 12 building. Make a big jump to reach its roof, where you can find the plush in front of a pink dog graffiti.</p> <h3><span id="movie-studio"></span>Movie Studio<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614534">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Start moving forward and transfer off the half pipes to the left. Jump into the green bowl with the spaceship prop above it, and then cross the tied rope in the corner. The plush is sitting a little to the right, so you might need to fling yourself to collect it.</p> <h3><span id="alcatraz"></span>Alcatraz<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614535">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll need to head to the rooftops for this one. Once you’re up there, skate up the ramp leading to a red pipe and grind it around the old water tower and down the wire leading to a silo. Jump off the wire and try to land on the small walkway to reach the plush.</p> <h3><span id="water-park"></span>Water Park<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614536">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Jump off to the right as soon as you can and skate around until you reach a wooden ramp and a gigantic red bucket. Just beneath the wooden ramp and to the right is a small platform with the plush.</p> <h3><span id="kona"></span>Kona<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614539" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614539"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614539">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The starting position for this map changes, so I suggest finding the corner with the long, windy grey ramps. Follow the wooden fence perimeter until you see a blue dumpster next to a red half pipe. You can find the plush next to the former.</p> <h3><span id="shipyard"></span>Shipyard<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614540">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and then move between the buildings to the left. Enter the open warehouse on the left side to reach the rooftop. Jump to the adjacent roof and then jump to the grated walkway on the right. Hop over the small half pipe and then jump onto the walkway of the nearby rusted building. The plush is sitting on the other side.</p> <h3><span id="london"></span>London<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614541">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and approach where the blue van is for Stompy the Elephant. Turn left instead and descend into a small parking garage. The blue sports car is pointing directly toward some trash and the small plush.</p> <h3><span id="zoo"></span>Zoo<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614542"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614542">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Skate down the ramp and turn right. Keep on going until you reach the Lion’s area, which you’ll want to grind the top of. On the left side will be a small platform for the plush.</p> <h3><span id="pinball"></span>Pinball<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614543" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614543"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614543">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go down the ramp and take either rail across. Slow down and climb on the brown bolted-on bar on the left side. Position yourself with lots of room, because you need to climb up this wall. This is done by executing a wallride and then immediately jumping to grind the edge at the top and then hopping off before your skater zooms off. The only thing up here is the final plush, which will unlock Constable Richard in the Secret Shop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PCs.</p>

Treyarch has <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" rel="nofollow ">released a new video</a> to discuss some of the new features and details players can expect for this Zombies finale, which includes parachutes, upgradable traps, and the brand-new Wonder Weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's latest video gives a deep dive into the Reckoning map, which takes place at Liberty Fall's Janus Towers location. The map features three tall towers for players to fight the undead. These spaces can be navigated with teleporters, anti-gravity launchers, and parachutes, marking the first time parachutes are featured on a traditional round-based Zombies map.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Get an inside look at the conclusion of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> Zombies 🧟‍♂️</p><p>Treyarch takes us inside Reckoning, breaking down the final map and the new features that deliver an unforgettable finale 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/pdQpcmv1XV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/pdQpcmv1XV</a></p></div>  — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The video also teases that parts of the Reckoning map will feature low gravity.

Players can interact with a new machine on the map called Caster, which lets them upgrade various traps. The video shows off one of the new traps, which is a wall-mounted cannon that shoots dark aether energy, and the developer says the trap can be updated with parts to make it more effective.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also shows the map's unique Wonder Weapon in action. The Reckoning map features the Gorgofex, which is a pistol-type weapon that fires Aether-based energy. This Wonder Weapon will feature two possible upgrades to make it even more powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Uberklaus is the name for the map's new elite enemy type.

It turns out there's more to Microsoft's 40th birthday celebrations for beloved UK studio Rare than just an ugly controller. Xbox has now <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/04/rare-40th-anniversary-rewards-sea-of-thieves/">outlined its full anniversary plans</a>, which include an Evercade cartridge collection, a four-disc vinyl soundtrack, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> bits, and more.
</p>
<p>
These days, Rare is best known for Sea of Thieves, but before that it gave us the wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viva-piata">Viva Piñata</a> among other delights. And fans of a certain age will fondly recall the studio's legendary Nintendo output, which included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> series on SNES, and a stellar run of N64 titles, such as Banjo-Kazooie, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>, Blast Corps, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-force-gemini">Jet Force Gemini</a>, Diddy Kong Racing, Perfect Dark, and Conker's Bad Fur Day. But go back even further, to the days of rubber-keyed Spectrums and tangled tape cassettes, and the studio - then known as Ultimate Play the Game - was already pumping out bangers like Sabre Wolf, Jetpack, Atic Atac, and Knight Lore.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say there's a lot to celebrate as the studio turns 40, and current Rare owner Microsoft has now detailed its birthday plans. Long-time fans will, for instance, have the opportunity to purchase iam8bit's Rare 40th Anniversary Box Set, which features 39 tracks across four-discs. It costs $100 USD (pre-orders <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/rare-40th-anniversary-box-set-4xlp">go live on 7th August</a>) and includes two and a half hours of music, spanning the likes of Sea of Thieves, Viva Piñata, Battletoads, Banjo-Kazooie, Kinect Sports, Perfect Dark, Killer Instinct, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Jet Force Gemini, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Blast Corps, and Kameo: Elements of Power.

<p>
Microsoft has also <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/rare-collection-1/">teamed up with Evercade to release a new cartridge collection</a> featuring twelve "vintage" Rare titles. Specifically, it includes Jetpac, Lunar Jetman, Atic Atac, Sabre Wulf, Underwurlde, Knight Lore, Gunfright, RC Pro-Am, Cobra Triangle, Battletoads, Battletoads Arcade, and Conker's Pocket Tales, with pre-orders going live on 30th September. Elsewhere, Fangamer has a wide-ranging (but disappointingly Viva Piñata-averse) <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/rare">merchandise collection</a>, which runs from t-shirts and vinyl soundtracks to key rings and a King Conker plushie I'm struggling to resist. As for that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-a-rough-year-for-rare-but-at-least-xbox-is-celebrating-its-40th-anniversary-with-a-licensed-controller">previously leaked 8bitdo Rare 40th Anniversary Edition controller</a>, it costs $89.99 USD and still seems to be a US exclusive.
</p>
<p>
And inevitably, Sea of Thieves is also getting in on the birthday action. Starting tomorrow, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can grab the in-game Rare Ruby Emote as a Perk, and a Pirate Emporium sale begins on 6th August, discounting various cosmetics inspired by classic Rare games. There's more happening from 14th August, when the multiplayer pirate adventure's next season, Smugglers' Tide, begins. Players that log in before the end of the month, for instance, get the Rare Ruby Eyepatch; various ruby-themed items will be available to purchase from Outposts, and the Ruby Legend Figurehead can be unlocked as a goal during the next Community Weekend on 30th August. On top of that, there's a 40th Anniversary Sea of Thieves cosmetics bundle coming to digital storefronts when the new season starts, as well as a ruby ship set in the Pirate Emporium and ruby items in the Seasonal Plunder Pass.

<p>
But if you're in need of more immediate celebrations, Microsoft has just launched new Xbox gamerpics and a dynamic background featuring a "who's-who of Rare characters old and new". Furthermore, Rare fans able to make the pilgrimage to the English town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, can gaze upon a blue heritage plaque, which has been unveiled on the building where Tim and Chris Stamper co-founded the studio in 1985.
</p>
<p>
It's just a shame all this follows a difficult year for Rare, which saw its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">long-in-the-works fantasy game Everwild cancelled</a> in July with some employees facing redundancy amid devastating Xbox restructuring that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">resulted in substantial job cuts across Microsoft's games division</a>. Additionally, Rare veteran Gregg Mayles, who directed the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departed the studio after more than 35 years</a>.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/titan-quest-2-early-access-out-now-2000614459"><em>Titan Quest II</em> snuck up out of nowhere</a> and surprised us all. The sequel to the 2006 classic may have nothing to do with the original developers, nor even the original publishers, but after spending a few hours with the game I’m left in no doubt that it understands the spirit of what it’s trying to recreate. It’s just that this Early Access release isn’t close to optimized, and lacks some incredibly obvious quality-of-life features.</p> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was released midway through the twelve-year gap between&nbsp;<em>Diablo II </em>and&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>, and even three years before the release of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight</em>. While hardcore action-RPG players had just been given 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Fate</em>, the market was so very open for a more immediately approachable&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like, and Iron Lore Entertainment’s Greek (and Egyptian) mythology game perfectly fit the bill. It’s super-low-key approach to the genre meant you weren’t worrying about min-maxing your intricate build, but were far more likely to just be methodically click-click-clicking your way through its luscious lands. Not quite an idle game (those were years from being a thing), <em>Titan Quest</em> allowed a nonchalance in its delivery of constant dopamine hits as you incessantly progressed, whether geographically or in the quality of your equipment. And this, from my admittedly brief time so far with <em>Titan Quest II</em>, seems to be entirely understood. In a lot of ways–and ways that leave me optimistic despite my laundry list of complaints–it’s the sequel you would want.</p> <p>Then, on the other hand, the game is causing my GPU to be transformed into a thermo-nuclear bomb, forcing me to turn it off lest I blow up my entire town.</p>

 <p>A lack of optimization is perhaps typical for an Early Access game, but&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>‘s crappy framerates and attempts at arson via my PC feel a bit too much. More frustrating to me are the obvious quality-of-life features that you just expect any game in this genre to already have in place, like, I dunno, being able to rebind controller buttons, or not have to hold down a key to be able to compare inventory items. It’s also not great that trying to use a ladder can see you endlessly spinning on the spot with no choice but to reload.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614551"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614551">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Titan Quest II</em> starts exactly right. The opening of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was so idyllic, such a perfect bucolic setting, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-seem-to-be-having-trouble-starting-titan-quest">that I didn’t want to leave it</a>. This sequel 19 years on seems to have fully understood this, and offers something that evokes the very same sense of serenity and safety. You stand atop a cliff, looking out over the gorgeous blue sea on the coast, a ruined building below, a shipwreck to your right, but it’s all so peaceful and pretty. However, you’re quickly urged on by another character to hurry and help, as a gryphon is attacking the nearby town, so off you go.</p> <p>After this, there’s definitely nothing that’ll especially surprise you if you’re familiar with action-RPGs.&nbsp;You left click to move, right click to attack, and enemies and items will drop you new equipment. After some inventory <em>Tetris</em>, you compare what you’ve picked up with what you’ve already got, swap it out, and then find a merchant on whom to dump the rest. And repeat. And that’s enough! That’s the joy of this genre, just enough to keep you distracted, ideally accompanied by a favorite podcast. However, for min-maxxers,&nbsp;<em>TQ2</em> does go the extra mile, with intricate information about your current build, allowing far more in-depth development should that be your thing; for everyone else, you can just make sure numbers go up, and when you gain a new level, add the abilities that sound the most interesting to you.</p>

 <p>Like in the original, there are various Masteries to choose from, although at this point in the sequel’s Early Access they number just four, all familiar. There’s Earth, Lightning, Warfare, and Rogue, and alongside these there’s Core, which lets you boost your main attack in various ways. Then there’s the usual stats to push upward as you go. However, this time out it’s all far more complicated than it should be, with each Mastery filled with a squillion different skills, and each of those skills then upgraded themselves with micro-skills, and given the result is just hitting something harder, or making lightning zap the enemies, it doesn’t need to be anywhere this muddled. The tutorials aren’t great at explaining it all at this point either, although I just sort of guessed and things seemed fine.</p> <p>There are a couple of more significant changes. Firstly, there’s now a dash, which makes for more interesting moments in combat when you’re being targeted by an attack that’s focused on a particular spot on the ground. And perhaps slightly controversially, the game has done away with proper potions, instead having sort of magic ones that refill as a result of your combat. Fight more, and you can heal more. It’s odd. I think I preferred just being able to buy a hundred health potions and not having to think about it. Along with these, there are little details that felt very positive; I was especially pleased with how arrows pierce enemies and can be used to take down groups charging in a line. Or the way a portal spawns nearby where you die, so you don’t have the misery of trudging all the way back to where you fell.</p>

 <p>I was happy! I found ranged attacks far more viable here than they were in the original, which is lovely, and I was happily switching between bow and club depending upon the circumstances, walloping everything and scooping up loot. But, the more I played, the more something felt off. And it’s not just the shitty framerates. But it is also the shitty framerates.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614553"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614553">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s get the tech stuff out of the way, as this aspect is likely to be fixed the most quickly. The game ran for me at around 40FPS, even when I’d lowered the settings from its recommendations, and even running it in a too-small window. Worse, that fluctuated, sometimes 55, sometimes 35, and all that jarring change made it feel clumsy. And remember, this is a fixed-camera isometric RPG. It’s also pretty astonishing that a PC game from a big-name publisher released in 2025 wouldn’t have sensible graphics settings, but <em>TQ2</em>‘s are a mess. I have an ultra-wide monitor, and was only able to choose between 3440×1440 in fullscreen (which I wouldn’t expect to be optimized for just yet) or the deeply obscure 2048×1152 in a window, which is tiny on this screen. There was no option for a bog-standard 2560×1440, which is pretty dreadful, especially since it clearly&nbsp;<em>can</em> run in those higher resolutions. This feels pretty amateurish.</p>

 <p>That leaden feeling to movement, likely caused by framerate issues, is I think the most off-putting aspect at the moment. But there’s more insidious stuff, like the weird way loot drops from all the wrong places. A real joy of <em>Titan Quest</em> is that enemies dropped what they had. If you killed a boar, the best you’d get is a boar hide. But if your enemy was equipped with a shield and axe, there was a strong chance of finding those on the floor after it was dead. But here, I watched the intense silliness of a giant eagle dropping a pair of shoes as it died. I also saw snakes flinging out gloves as they flopped to the ground. I’m not a fully qualified herpetologist, but I’m pretty sure they have little use for gloves. No, it doesn’t <em>matter</em>, but it’s kind of crap.</p> <p>Then there’s just inexplicable choices, like needing to hold down Alt to compare items in your inventory with those that are equipped. There’s no circumstance ever where you don’t want the comparison to pop up, which is why all games like this do it by default (or offer a toggle for the mad people). Here, when you’re trying to sort through your junk to sell to a merchant, you have to tie your fingers in knots holding down Alt to compare, the Shift to sell, and it’s all far more of a fiddle than could possibly be needed. Why no toggle? Who lives like that? Then there’s the inability to rebind controller inputs, and the astonishingly hard boss fights, and maybe most of all, the lack of a sense of place.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614560"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614560">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It says it’s set in ancient Greece, but if that’s true, why are there ruins everywhere? The developers know they didn’t start out that way, right? There’s a lovely intro video which explains how Nemesis is out of control, and the threads of Fate have been corrupted, and someone has to stop her, but then absolutely no sense of how that links to who you are and why you’re there. Everyone else seems to know who you are, but you don’t! You just start off with someone shouting about a gryphon and you just get on with it, but with no grounding. At least in <em>Titan Quest</em>, this blank slate start was understood by your having just arrived on a boat, with NPCs frantically getting you up to date.</p> <p>I dunno. I think I’m perhaps being overly fussy, and will likely get over all of this as soon as I can run the game at a steady framerate and a sensible scale without personally accelerating global climate change. I actually really like a lot about this, and think that with a few patches, it’ll be an Early Access game worth investing in. Sure, more Masteries would be good, but they’ve put in the most popular here, so you’ve plenty to get on with.</p> <p>It’s also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> isn’t&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>, and was never trying to be. This isn’t about rushing through the actual game in order to reach end-game sicko content–it’s about enjoying the journey. And it’s incredibly refreshing to pick up an ARPG that <em>isn’t</em> bloated with live-service faff of the sort that makes games like <em>Path of Exile 2</em> feel so incredibly inaccessible to me. I feel like&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em> might be exactly the game I’ve been wanting ever since the last time <em>Torchlight&nbsp;</em>was any good, and it just needs a little bit of work before it can deliver it.</p> <p>For now, you may want to hold off a couple of weeks while it gets its shit together. That it’s only $24 really does make a massive difference, it should be said, and once that sluggish feel is gone, I’ll likely be mainlining the game.</p>

But don’t hold your breath for a reveal: Vincke called on fans to be patient as Larian "need a bit of time to make it all work."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game Baldur’s Gate 3 was a breakout hit in 2023, dominating online conversation and setting sales records. Its wild success was a game-changer for Larian, and it has continued to perform strongly in the two years since launch, with mods helping to fuel seemingly never-ending interest in the RPG, especially on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke told IGN in September 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-one-year-later-larian-interview"><u>the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 meant Larian was now in a “luxurious position,”</u></a> and could “pick our own destiny and our own path.” The developer shocked the video game world when it announced plans to make brand new games outside the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, rather than follow Baldur’s Gate 3 with DLC or a sequel. It is now hard at work realizing that vision, Vincke said in a tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crazy to think it’s only been two years,” he said. “It’s truly been life changing. Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess but I can assure you we’re working hard to ensure you’ll have plenty of fun. Like really — loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient / we’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing.

Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says"><u>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," Ayoub said. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, even if making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Blizzard's dark fantasy ARPG series Diablo is getting the tabletop RPG treatment, and it promises to have players geared up and ready to hack and slash through armies of demons from "session zero."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/706666020?ref=36816m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> page for Diablo: The Roleplaying Game recently went live, and while the campaign won't officially begin until this fall, it does provide some details on what players can expect from the TTRPG adaptation. The game comes from Glass Cannon, which has made board game versions of plenty of video games in the past, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-is-planned-for-later-this-year/1100-6511682/" data-ref-id="1100-6511682">Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how the TTRPG will try to capture the spirit of the Diablo video games, Glass Cannon name drops a few Diablo classes players will be able to play as, including Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer (the same classes available at launch in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>). More importantly, it gives a glimpse of how it is looking to adapt Diablo's fast-and-frenetic ARPG action into a tabletop format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744"></a><figcaption>A look at some of the miniatures included as part of Diablo: The Roleplaying Game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, Glass Cannon promises there won't be "inexperienced and squishy first-level characters." Instead, player characters will begin their adventure "fully equipped as a seasoned hero ready to live the epic-level dream of TTRPGs from session zero." Battles will see players fighting through "endless mobs in fast paced, tactical combat where story, stats, and synergies hold sway." There will additionally be a "push-your-luck" mechanic inspired by the Diablo universe's Eternal Conflict between the forces of heaven and hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo: The Roleplaying Game will sport a 300-page core rulebook that will provide game rules, lore, and artwork. It will be accompanied by a number of one-shot adventures for players to experience from writers like Graham McNeill, known for their work in the Warhammer universe, and MJ Newman of Arkham Horror fame. The game's rules will use a custom d6 dice-pool system and will also come with detailed miniatures, previews of which can be seen on the Kickstarter page.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when in the Diablo timeline the Diablo TTRPG will be set, it looks to take place around the time of Diablo 4, with marketing material showing Lilith and featuring taglines like "be beautiful in sin." The Kickstarter page states that players will be able to "explore Sanctuary's diverse lands and history spanning the entire franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">That's about all the details known so far, but those interested in learning more can sign up to be notified about the Kickstarter campaign's upcoming launch.</p><p dir="ltr">In Diablo video game news, various content creators were treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse at Diablo 4's future</a>, even as Blizzard itself states that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/those-hoping-for-major-diablo-4-update-news-may-have-to-keep-waiting/1100-6533522/" data-ref-id="1100-6533522">won't be any major Diablo 4 news</a> ahead of Season 10 in September. Diablo 4 was also recently cleared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">release in China</a> after receiving governmental approval.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1c019541f4a5/super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Five years ago, Nintendo made an appropriately big thing of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>' 35th anniversary, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/09/nintendo_announces_super_mario_remasters_and_much_more_in_super_mario_bros_35th_anniversary_direct">a bespoke Direct</a> broadcast featuring a bunch of new games and, naturally, merch celebrating the Famicom release of video gaming's most famous platformer on 13th September 1985.</p>
<p>Half a decade on and the 40th anniversary is just over a month away. With Switch 2 out in the wild and a Mario platformer-shaped gap in Nintendo's announced lineup, it feels natural that there would be similar celebrations planned for this year. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_bros_35">Super Mario Bros. <del>35</del> 40</a>, anyone?</p>
<p>There are some easy gimmes Nintendo could put out — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> updates, a new Lego set, a bunch of swag with 'Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary' plastered all over it — and with DK ably taking on 3D platformer duties in the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>, the need for the brand new 3D Mario game we've all been waiting for since 2017's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> isn't <em>quite</em> as desperate as it was at the start of the year. But still, the door is wide open for all sorts of plumber-related news.</p>
<p>Realistically, we're a few weeks away from any potential announcements, but let's take a look at what Team NL predicts Nintendo is cooking up for SMB's 40th...</p>
<h2>Super Mario Maker 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Ludicrously Long Title Addendum That's Totally Impractical For Any Normal Person To Say Or Even Remem— (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Maker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d48df7d5e3761/mario-maker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's coming up on four decades of SMB, it's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_maker">Super Mario Maker</a>'s 10th anniversary on 10th September. Seeing as it's already a celebration of the series, I've got my money on a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker 2</a>, which adds in a Wonder theme and some Mouse Mode controls.</p>
<p>Sticking to anniversary-related releases (hey, where would games media be without a good old 'It's now been longer since X than it was between Y and Z', huh?), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi's Island</a> turns 30 on 5th August. Now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/soapbox_25_years_on_i_still_cant_get_into_yoshis_island">I've never been a big fan</a> — beyond the stellar art — due to wailing baby anxiety, but can you imagine what a 4K sequel could look like?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know there have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshis_island_ds">Island</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yoshis_new_island">sequels</a> already, but let's not talk about those. I'm thinking something more along the lines of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">Link Between Worlds</a> to the original's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">Link to the Past</a>, not a wet fart to Yoshi's Island's...</p>
<p>Hmm, I've gotten myself in trouble with an analogy and a game I don't even like very much, Alana. Hilfe, bitte...</p>
<h2>Weird Mario, please (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="DDR: Mario Mix" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e555c6997d524/ddr-mario-mix.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hooo boy, I'm going to forgo all of the obvious things here; yes, it's time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_golf">Mario Golf</a>. Yes, it's time for a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Sluggers</a>. But where the heck is a new version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/dance_dance_revolution_mario_mix">Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</a>???</p>
<p>Okay, I'm not the target audience for a new DDR Mario game, but this gets to the core I want from Mario going forward — more <em>weird</em> Mario. The <strong>Mario RPG</strong>s and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> have been carrying the torch over the past few years, and with Nintendo's improved animations, I think it's time we got some of those unusual spin-offs on Nintendo Switch Online. Or a new game.</p>
<p>Realistically, we'll get a <strong>Mario Movie 2</strong> teaser, a 3D Mario tease... maybe a new Nintendo Switch 2 design? Let's be reasonable, folks!</p>

<h2>Space, Jam (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario 3-on-3 Hoops" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b64dcb8587cf/mario-3-on-3-hoops.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can keep your Golf, Sluggers, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_strikers_battle_league">Strikers</a>, and Olympic Game crossovers; there's only one sporting event that I want to see back in action come September, and that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a>.</p>
<p>I mean, come on. Basketball seems to be bigger around the world today than ever before, and the death of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nba_jam">NBA Jam</a> has left an arcade baller-shaped hole in all of our hearts. Give me a full-blown Mario Hoops revival, complete with high-flying dunks and silky smooth performance, and you've got yourself a winner.</p>
<p>If that's off the table, however, it seems only right that we get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on Switch 2 in <em>some form</em>. At this point, I honestly don't care if it's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">3D All-Stars</a> update or the announcement of a catchily-titled 'Super Mario 3D All-Stars + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition'. I'll do whatever it takes to play it on modern hardware.</p>

<h2>99 Marios and 1 Yoshi in a thong (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi's New Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/762268c5260f4/yoshis-new-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I reckon the smart money is on a remaster or upgrade of some sort for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy</a> games, or hey, I'd even take a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> with fancy new Switch 2 controls and gimmicks. Shouting "Pump it!" into the mic for paint to come out of your gun or something. I'll let the boffins figure out the fine details.</p>
<p>However, seeing as there's been so little fanfare thus far, maybe it's gonna be something totally different, something small-scale. Or maybe we'll get a brand new game, a whole new-ass Mario stealthing onto the scene, they could even call it New-Ass Mario, they can have that for free.</p>
<p>If I had my choice, I'd like to see where Nintendo would go with some sort of Mario 99 game, something challenging and unique. You know, jumping along a route and when you fall, you're out. Or, since we've just had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> drop on NSO, maybe they're testing the waters for a brand new version of that. I'd also like to see Mario Beach Volleyball. Come on, Nintendo, you know you want to put Yoshi in bikini bottoms.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Those are a few of our hopes, but what do you think Nintendo might roll out as Super Mario Bros. enters its fifth decade? Does <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario Land 3D</a> get a Deluxe port? Do we get a 1:1 of 1-1 in Lego form? Is it time for Mario's Broadway debut as we discover Miyamoto's been on a Gilbert and Sullivan binge?</em> <em>Let us know below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Swen Vincke, the director of the massively popular and <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491">successful RPG</a><em> Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> recently teased Larian Studios’ next big game on social media while celebrating the fact that it has been two years since the team’s <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed game left early access and became a global phenomenon.</p> <p>On August 3, a content creator on Twitter shared the news that it had now been exactly two years since <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> left early access on Steam and was fully released to the world. The turn-based RPG quickly became one of the biggest games of 2023 thanks to its incredible depth, wonderful writing, and its numerous, memorable romance options.<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> ended up winning so many awards after its launch that it <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-too-many-awards-winning-larian-goty-1851593323">started causing problems for developer Larian Studios</a>. Now, two years later, Vincke shared that tweet announcing the anniversary and <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253?t=6umojy2gp7HUKigWoKWTU">called <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 “</em>life changing”</a> while teasing the studio’s next big project, which he claims is only possible thanks to<em> BG3</em>‘s success.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing. Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway.  BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess but I can assure you we’re working hard… <a href="https://t.co/bGBYZoSXGZ">https://t.co/bGBYZoSXGZ</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing,” said Vincke on Twitter. “Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. <em>BG3</em> was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess, but I can assure you we’re working hard to ensure you’ll have plenty of fun. Like really – loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient.”</p>

 <p>This isn’t the first time Vincke has teased a big, new, ambitious game that isn’t<em> Baldur’s Gate 4</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">In March 2024</a>, while talking at GDC, Vincke confirmed that Larian wasn’t working on an expansion for <em>BG3</em>, nor was the studio developing a sequel. Instead, he confirmed that it was working on two new games based on original IP. At the time, the CEO and <em>BG3</em> director claimed both games were still in the very early stages of development. <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-next-game-ip-divinity-rpg-1851419091">The next month</a>, Vincke once again teased the studio’s next game, this time as a part of a blog about a <em>BG3</em> update on Steam.</p> <p>“I don’t know if we’re going to pull it off, but looking at our narrative, visual, and gameplay plans, I think what we’re working on now will be our best work ever,” Vincke said in the 2024 post. “I get excited like a kid watching the key imagery, want to show it to everyone now, and grumble in frustration at having to wait until it’s actually all working. Yes, it’s hype, but it’s hype because it really looks and feels good.”</p> <p>So yeah, whatever Larian Studios is working on right now sounds massive and impressive, and is likely years away. In Vincke’s post on Monday, he ended it with: “We’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though.”</p>

            <p>The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> game in development at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a> Games is in difficulties, according to sources of the multiple and anonymous persuasion. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-bioshock-announced">Announced in 2019</a>, the game has reportedly failed a recent internal progress review, with its narrative found to be in particular need of revamping. </p>
<p>Publishers 2K Games aren't talking about any of this, naturally, but they <em>have</em> confirmed that they've treated Cloud Chamber to a not-at-all punitive studio reshuffle, with Kelley Gilmore losing her position as studio head, while former creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been reassigned to a publishing role.</p>
<p>The report comes care of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), who cite "people familiar with the situation". Gilmore and de la Plante's reassignments may not be the worst of the fallout. According to Bloomberg, staff were told at a recent all-hands meeting that they had to become "more agile and efficient" - a phrase equivalent in balefulness to "would you kindly", and a possible indication that layoffs are on the way.</p>
<p>2K Games ain't talking about that either. Here's what they've said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">IGN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote>
<p>Little is known about the new Bioshock, which may not be titled Bioshock 4 inasmuch as reverting to numbered sequels feels a bit ridiculous after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>. I used to win a lot of playground arguments by dint of the formula "timesed by infinity... <em>plus one</em>", but I can't see a major games publisher adopting that particular rhetorical gambit as a naming strategy. Ehhh, maybe Square Enix.</p>
<p>The little we know about the new Bioshock includes the fact that original series figurehead and videogame thespian Ken Levine isn't working on it. He's off making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> at Ghost Story Games. Beyond that, we can only speculate based on previous instalments. There will, presumably, be a man, a city and a lighthouse. It'll be an FPS with a sprinkling of imsim and some arch literary ambitions, and there will be a false utopia of some kind. You will be able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-4-should-let-you-fire-an-albatross-from-your-hand">shoot animals out of your hands</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report also alleges that 2K Games cancelled a Bioshock 1 remake earlier this year. I think I can probably do without a Bioshock remake, but I'm sorry for any developers potentially affected. Best of luck to all at Cloud Chamber bringing Nushock home.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Three titles currently in production, including new game from Blackbird Interactive.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Lyrical Media has announced the establishment of <a title="Companies > Lyrical Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/lyrical-games">Lyrical Games</a>, a privately funded game publisher committed to “empowering creators of high-quality indie games.” The company currently has three titles in production with “top-tier developers,” including <a title="Companies > Blackbird Interactive [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/blackbird-interactive">Blackbird Interactive</a>, the reveals of which are coming soon. <span id="more-982222"></span></p><p>Lyrical Games is headed by Blake Rochkind, the former head of business development at <a title="Companies > Take-Two Interactive Software [847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software">Take-Two Interactive Software</a>‘s <a title="Companies > Private Division [80 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/private-division">Private Division</a>. Rochkind is joined by Roger Kurtz, the former head of production at Private Division, and a team of games publishing veterans with “decades” of experience across companies like <a title="Companies > Devolver Digital [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a>, <a title="Companies > Humble Games [144 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a>, Microsoft, and more. </p><p>According to the press release, Lyrical Games will support “imaginative and high-caliber games that live between the extremes of smaller indies and massive AAA productions.”</p><p>“From the very beginning of Lyrical Media, we set out to be a premier home for amazing storytelling regardless of medium,” said Lyrical Media founder and CEO Alexander Black in the press release. “We want to empower fiercely passionate game creators by bridging the gap between their art and the players who stand to be moved by it. Lyrical Games has the experience to know that we are nothing without our partners and their vision.”</p><p>Lyrical Games head Blake Rochkind adde,d “At Lyrical Games, we firmly believe developers are often the best stewards of their own game. In today’s landscape, there has never been more noise, and not every developer necessarily needs a publisher. We built Lyrical Games to be the kind of publisher they want to work with. In this new normal, it’s never been more important for both developers and their publishing partners to share a clear, holistic vision at the outset—not just for the game itself, but who that audience is and how they can and should be reached.”</p><p>Rochkind continued, “In the high end indie or ‘triple-i’ space, we believe we can offer among the best, if not the best, deal terms available right now. We’re not just looking for developers, but for partners who want a meaningful say in all the ways their game will be shown to the world. Developers we work with will always have ownership of their IP, and our partnerships will always value collaboration and transparency above all else.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>"Game wont load now," said one player on the game's Steam forum. "Maybe it's just me, but I was playing 20 minutes before the update and now it wont launch."</p><p>Another player said, "I downloaded the 1.3.0 patch and ran the game, but it suddenly stopped working. I reinstalled it and ran it again, but it still won't work. It worked fine before the patch."</p><p>For those experiencing the same issue, a Stellar Blade developer who goes by 'Wolfcastle' on Steam has offered a possible solution to the problem (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/stellar-blade/update-problems" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>).</p><p>"If you are having issues launching the game after updating, there may be an incompatibility with UE4SS or mod you are using," Wolfcastle <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3489700/eventcomments/604163526655818928?snr=1_2108_9__2107#c604163526655825025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. "Please try completely removing these files and seeing if the issue persists." However, a different player said the suggestion didn't work even after removing their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-stellar-blade-mods/2900-6696/" data-ref-id="2900-6696">Stellar Blade mods</a>.</p><p>Shift Up hasn't responded to this issue just yet, but one user on the Stellar Blade <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1mh1oli/stellar_blade_gets_surprise_patch_on_the_weekend/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has suggested a temporary fix that requires players to edit their UE4SS files in the game's directory.</p><p>Among the list of bug fixes, patch 1.3.0 also adds an improved photo mode and players will now need to restart their game when enabling the FSR frame generation. You can check out the full patch notes below, along with the PS5 patch notes.</p><h3><strong>Stellar Blade PC Version 1.3.0 and PS5 Version 1.013 - Patch Notes</strong></h3><p><strong>PS5 &amp; PC Shared update details</strong></p><ul><li>Improved Photo Mode so that when selecting a logo, the logo control indicator is now displayed</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to exit the shop after purchasing the 'Polarized Sunglasses' from Clyde’s shop</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve’s hair would not appear during the final Elder Naytiba cutscene when wearing the 'Fluffy Bear' or 'Pink Bear' outfits</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve's final Korean voice-over line was cut off during the 'Lost Items from Heaven' conversation with Clyde in the Great Desert</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve’s arm would occasionally appear unnatural in Photo Mode when wearing the 'Black Pearl' or 'Red Pearl' outfits</li></ul><p><strong>PS5</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where entering the 'Demogorgon' battle with 'Ranged Auto Aim' turned OFF would cause the camera to shift away from its intended position, making it impossible to aim</li></ul><p><strong>PC</strong></p><ul><li>When using FSR upscaler, restarting the game is now required to enable frame generation</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Fusion Weapon was not visible when beginning the fight against the Airborne Squad after defeating Providence</li><li>Fixed an issue where using the numpad on the keyboard to trigger skills in the Training Room caused the training system to become unresponsive</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when fishing for the 'Betta' fish with mouse and keyboard, the gray striped pattern of the progress bar would obscure the reel-in progress bar</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when using the 'Stinger', target lock-on would not function correctly under specific input conditions</li><li>Fixed an issue where the zoom function in the Hair Salon menu would not respond to controller or keyboard input</li><li>Fixed an issue where dialogue would occasionally not display after interacting with Adam in the Eidos 9 Atelier</li><li>Fixed an issue where Dororong would occasionally not appear during their introduction scene in Xion</li><li>Fixed an issue where newly unlocked items would not immediately appear after increasing shop affinity level</li><li>Improved the save timestamp system so that time since last save is now accurately displayed based on successful saves, rather than attempted saves</li><li>Enhanced the save failure message by changing it to yellow for better visibility</li><li>Various other bug fixes</li></ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has just turned two, which doesn't make any sense because there is no way that I am two years older than I was when it first came out, so I think Larian is lying.</p>
<p>But even so, the studio has released a few surprising stats about its critically acclaimed party-based RPG to mark the occasion.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, it turns out that 2.07 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players managed to defeat twenty opponents while drunk. Fair to say this will be in-game intoxication, because I am sure there have been plenty of wines and beers consumed while playing, and far more than 2.07 percent of us will have been a little tipsy while negotiating the world with Shadowheart and co (don't lie, it is not just me who does that).</p>
<p>Additionally, 3.87 percent of players managed to defeat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. The developer noted those on Steam are a bit more canny with their footwork than those of us playing on Xbox or PlayStation, with 4.37 percent of players on Valve's platform successfully avoiding triggering traps (I am not one of them).</p>

<p>Also, 1.1 million players have completed Baldur's Gate 3 in Tactician Mode, one of the game's highest difficulty settings. Following that, almost half a million players "thought it would be fun" to complete Baldur's Gate 3 in Honour Mode, which builds on Tactician Mode by adding things like tougher bosses, stricter rules and a single save slot.</p>
<p>Of those half a mil, 4,647 players managed to beat Honour Mode with a Level 1 character. Meanwhile, 31,180 players beat Honour Mode as a Jack of All Trades.</p>

<p>Now, I play as a Barbarian in my own real world D&amp;D campaign, so I like this next stat because it speaks to my character (she's called Quinn). Larian has revealed 8.21 percent of players thought to use an enemy as an improvised weapon against another. These are my people!</p>
<p>350 players also respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, to which Larian asked: "Are you folks doing okay?"</p>
<p>Now, this stat is quite heartwarming. Apparently 598 players adopted a child with Wyll, which is cute.</p>

<p>Larian has also celebrated 265m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). Of those, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">over 250,000 of all downloads are Withers Big Naturals</a>, a mod which, yes, gives Withers breasts.</p>

<p>"Crazy to think it's only been two years. It's truly been life changing," <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253">studio founder Swen Vincke wrote on social media yesterday</a>, celebrating Baldur's Gate 3's anniversary. "Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing</a>. </p>
<p>"How that will pan out is anyone's guess but I can assure you we're working hard to ensure you'll have plenty of fun. Like really - loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can't wait to show you. But you'll need to be patient / we'll need a bit of time to make it all work. It'll be worth it though."</p>
<p>As for what that next "crazy" thing is? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">all we really know for now is it isn't Baldur's Gate 4</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-celebrates-second-anniversary-with-obscure-stats-and-the-revelation-over-250k-of-us-opted-to-see-withers-big-naturals]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">Magnus APU</a> rumored to be powering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/">Xbox next-generation system </a>will provide, with its unique design, a lot of flexibility that will allow Microsoft to scale an entire stack of systems that are more likely to compete with pre-built PCs rather than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">PlayStation 6</a> and other traditional consoles.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry went over the recently leaked Magnus APU said to power the next-generation Xbox, highlighting how different it is from the APUs powering the past and current generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles, not only in terms of size, but also in terms of design. Not only does this design, featuring separate CPU and GPU dies, steps away from the traditional monolithic design that balances power with costs, it will also be more powerful than anything we have seen so far, and supports a potential iterative approach to console design, giving Microsoft the ability to mix dies for more frequent upgrades than in traditional console cycles. This design could also be carried across multiple generations, falling in line with a "phases" approach, as opposed to the current "generations" approach, that Microsoft seems to be aiming for, considering recent developments.</p>



<p>Although the Xbox next-generation system's Magnus APU looks expensive, its flexibility will potentially also impact the gaming PC market, Digital Fundry speculates. From AMD's point of view, being able to ship an entire Xbox PC with this condensed, likely cheaper design could be huge, allowing them to gain a bigger share in the market and provide a cheaper alternative to pre-built PCs, which are far from being affordable. As such, there's a real possibility that the concept of the "console war" between Sony and Microsoft will change forever, as the Xbox next-generation systems will likely compete with pre-built gaming PCs, rather than the PlayStation 6.</p>

Nintendo Direct Reaction!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dGdZDTaD0M?start=77&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>With Microsoft's current approach of turning everything into an Xbox, a design like that of the Magnus APU seems to fall almost perfectly in line with the company's current strategy. As the Xbox next-generation system is reportedly launching sooner than the PlayStation 6, it will likely not take much longer to know how the flexibility afforded by the APU will change the future of gaming systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios is celebrating&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s second anniversary, and as part of those celebrations, the developer has released some fun statistics about the celebrated CRPG, including which of the game's cast is the most-respecced character and more.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Community Update 35 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, Larian reveals that the cleric Shadowheart is the game's most-respecced character, which, if you're new to CRPGs, means she's the one whose class or subclass players have changed the most.</p>

<p>According to Larian, Shadowheart was most often switched to either the Life Domain or Death Domain subclasses, so while players aren't changing her overall class, they're clearly split on which cleric path Shadowheart should follow. That makes sense, given her personal storyline.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=l6VTBt82 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=mx03uKYn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shadowheart is&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s most-respecced character.</figcaption></figure><p>Wyll and Gael are in second and third place respectively, which, again, makes sense; I never quite found a place for Wyll in my party, so I turned him into a paladin, although that might fly in the face of the predicament in which he finds himself in the game.</p>

<p>Some other fun&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>stats include the 4,647 players who managed to beat the game's Honour Mode at level one, as well as the 350 players who decided that returning character Minsc would be better served as a Death Domain cleric. Hmm.</p>

<p>You can also see a bunch of fun photo mode creations that players have put together in the Steam post, as well as some info about what Larian is up to over the next few months (although that probably doesn't involve the studio announcing its next game, unfortunately).</p>




<p>The final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">was released back in April</a>, bringing features like a photo mode, crossplay between platforms, and cross-platform progression to allow you to continue your save across PC and console.</p>
