            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Empire has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and it's all thanks to Supergiant Games and its latest roguelite extravaganza.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Studio_Evil/status/1788886708064317943" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, Evil Empire says it's "decided to let people have their fun" with Supergiant's&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now">surprise-launched earlier this week</a>, before&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>launches.</p>
<p>The new release date hasn't been announced yet, but Evil Empire says the game will still be coming out sometime in May. A new launch date will be announced on Monday, the studio says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=1txjpWF1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=5sjMZnMW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e930a898-0b78-4fe2-859c-59772080ea8a" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=5sjMZnMW" alt="The Prince battling enemies in The Rogue Prince of Persia" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>is taking a little time to cook.</figcaption></figure><p>Evil Empire says that it has "every confidence" in its game, but that "it's not every day" that a rival game in the same genre launches into Early Access "a week before you plan to do the same".</p>
<p>The studio admirably admits that it's "not prideful enough to ignore the implications" of&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>launching at around the same time as its game, but lest you wonder whether the delay is purely motivated by Supergiant's game, that's not the case.</p>
<p>According to Evil Empire, this&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>delay will also allow the devs to polish the game up and banish some particularly troublesome bugs prior to launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we're part of the way through May already, the delay isn't likely to be too significant, so you probably won't have to wait more than another week or two to check out&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>.</p>

<p>The studio describes its game as a "challenging but accessible roguelite" with a fast pace, a seamless flow between platforming and combat, and "non-linear story progression". In other words, if you love&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells</em>, you'll likely be right at home here.</p>
<p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>launches sometime this month on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>update has hit the beta branch of the popular city-builder, and it's fixing some of the game's more infamous, not to mention hilarious, glitches and bugs.</p>
<p>Developer Slavic Magic (which is essentially a pseudonym for solo dev&nbsp;Grzegorz Styczeń) says that he's aiming to fix "all the most common reported issues" for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>with this update.</p>
<p>Issues fixed include the "famous "None" people spawning in huge numbers and refusing to do any work", which honestly sounds more like an organized labor strike than a glitch to me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-update-army.jpg?itok=oZbCLqlJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-army.jpg?itok=h6th20LX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3b06312a-3f64-4da6-8a0c-f113e2339bf7" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-army.jpg?itok=h6th20LX" alt="An army of armored soldiers assembled in a field in Manor Lords" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Are you guys of the "None" people? You can't come in.</figcaption></figure><p>Other issues being looked at in this beta&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>update include "very weak archer damage", as well as harsh over- and under-supply systems, people staying homeless despite perfectly good accommodation being available, and "overly high ale consumption".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's also now possible to use Trading Posts to trade between your regions without using Barter or Pack Stations, and when people die, there will be a 30-day mourning period that blocks growth.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3</em>, you'll probably find a lot of amusement in the&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/4201372769976733265" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>; this is, after all, the kind of game with a lot of complex overlapping systems, which means plenty of potential for hilarious glitches and issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-update-deaths.jpg?itok=m5m06XiK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-deaths.jpg?itok=ucBPySGE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="434931f2-e82e-48a1-8e8f-13170a0af12b" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-deaths.jpg?itok=ucBPySGE" alt="Citizens hauling off dead bodies in Manor Lords" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Deaths are now appropriately more tragic for your settlement in&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet">city-builder with grand strategy and RTS elements</a> developed by one-man dev outfit Slavic Magic.</p>
<p>Prior to its release last month,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>was one of Steam's most-wishlisted games, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count">quickly racked up over 100,000 players</a>&nbsp;on Steam alone just a couple of hours after its launch, no mean feat considering its day one Game Pass release.</p>
<p>Just a day or so after launch,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count">crossed the million sales mark</a>, and it remains popular at time of writing, attracting around 40,000 players in the last 24 hours (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1363080/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to SteamDB</a>, at least).</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>. It's also available via PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some of the features introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-gorgeous-industrial-factory-tech-demo-4080/">Unreal Engine 5.4</a>, such as renderer parallelization, bring considerable performance improvements, although frame-time stability still leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-unreal-engine-54-cpu-utilisation-visuals-performance">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the latest version of the engine by Epic released to the public last month, highlighting some of the key improvements in performance and visual quality. In regards to performance, the new renderer parallelization introduced in the new version of the engine can bring around 40% performance improvement in CPU-limited scenarios on a Ryzen 7 7800X3D on PC over version 5.0 in the Matrix Awakens demo. This also bodes well for consoles, as a PC attempting to replicate the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X specs sees considerable performance improvement in Unreal Engine 5.4 over version 5.0.</p>
<p>While Unreal Engine 5.4 brings significant performance improvements, stability still leaves something to be desired. Fortnite running on the latest version of the engine, using a combination of automatic asynchronous shader caching and shader compilation, stutters considerably, as does the Matrix Awakens demo. These stutters are even more noticeable in the latest version of the engine due to a greater disparity in frame times.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="sgTuUO">In 2020, director Karyn Kusama was tapped to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/new-dracula-movie-works-as-universal-remakes-monsterverse-1283635/">direct a new version</a> of Dracula for Blumhouse Productions. Like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/28/21154461/invisible-man-review-movie-elisabeth-moss-blumhouse-saw-leigh-whannell"><em>The Invisible Man</em></a> before it, the Dracula movie was going to be set in the modern day: a chance for Universal to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23885540/dark-universe-movies-universal-monsters-dracula-frankenstein-mummy">reboot its continually doomed Monsterverse</a>.</p>
<p id="kJfpxI">But Kusama was going to put a twist on<em> </em>Dracula. For one, the movie was going to be called <em>Mina Harker</em> instead, and focus on the female protagonist of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23063882/dracula-daily-tumblr-memes">Bram Stoker’s original novel</a>, with Jasmine Cephas Jones tapped to play her. Given Kusama’s legacy of movies about complicated and powerful women, like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/19/21524290/what-to-watch-netflix-amazon-hulu-jennifers-body-babadook-over-garden-wall"><em>Jennifer’s Bod</em></a><em>y</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22454800/aeon-flux-watching-adult-animation"><em>Æon Flux</em></a>, and <em>Girlfight</em>, Kusama’s take on Dracula would’ve given the old story an interesting edge and point-of-view. </p>
<p id="9QPdfD">But just three weeks before filming started, Kusama’s<em> </em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/04/what-killed-karyn-kusamas-dracula-film">Dracula movie was canceled</a>. And she’s pretty sure why. </p>
<p id="bnaVEJ">“I would say that the Dracula movie I was making wasn’t a straightforward monster movie,” Kusama shared with Polygon in a video interview. “And so perhaps that was its problem. It was very much rooted in the monsters that start at home in humans. That’s what was going to make it distinctive was that Dracula was more than a force of evil. He was a man. And that is, in some ways, both its reason for being and its obstacle. It was really hard to get the movie made. And even though we got so close, three weeks from shooting, people lost their nerve. So what are you going to do?”</p>

<p id="FPz4sQ"><em>Mina Harker </em>might not have materialized, but Kusama’s been busy with television projects. She serves as an executive producer on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/22865685/yellowjackets-theories-lost-cliffhanger-twist-showtime"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a>, and next up for her is the third season of AMC’s anthology series<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24063584/best-arctic-horror-movies-true-detective-night-country-30-days-of-night-the-terror-the-thing"><em>The Terror</em></a>, directing the first two episodes in addition to her role as an executive producer. This season is based on <em>The Devil in Silver</em> by Victor LaValle, which follows a man wrongly institutionalized in a mental hospital who confronts a terrifying monster in the halls night after night. </p>
<p id="uxAlyX">“It’s just a really, really beautiful story of I think systemic failure, personal and ethical failure and how that impacts all of us,” says Kusama. “I’m really, really excited by it. It’s going to be challenging, and it’s going to be great.”</p>
<p id="ykyHfO">Ideally, Kusama hopes to return to movies sooner rather than later, and she has a very specific notion of what kind of movie she wants to make next. </p>
<p id="iTvN4F">“I need to be making personal movies again,” she says. “That’s sort of where I really learn and flex and experiment and fail and try and all of it. So that’s kind of what’s next for me, is just figuring out what the next feature is going to be.”</p>

<p id="qZO8bE">Her first movie, <em>Girlfight</em>, <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/33189-girlfight">joins the Criterion Collection May 28</a>. It follows a young woman from Brooklyn, played by Michelle Rodriguez in her first role, who decides to channel her aggression in boxing. Since the movie came out in 2000, both Kusama and Rodriguez’s careers have evolved in very different ways. Rodriguez regularly headlines big action blockbusters, and has a legacy as Letty Ortiz in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23725611/fast-furious-cast-family-characters">Fast and the Furious movies.</a> But Kusama is specifically staying away from big franchises like that. </p>
<p id="ejjlcH">“It’s not really my vibe. And a lot of that just has to do with the idea that you need to be making something that is of a piece of a large entity with a lot of history and a lot of relationships that people are already bringing to the characters into the worlds,” she says. “For that reason, I’m not sure I’d be the best candidate for that kind of work. But never say never, I guess!”</p>

<p>Lightforge Games is the latest studio to be hit by the ongoing struggles of the gaming industry, with the team confirming it’s ‘downsizing to a skeleton crew’ at the end of May and pausing the development of Project O.R.C.S., the studio’s first game. This news comes after a ‘lengthy period’ of investor forums and publisher meetings, all of which resulted in the inability to secure funding to support the project moving forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-ambitious-idea">An Ambitious Idea</h2>



<p>Project O.R.C.S. is an ambitious effort from the minds of Blizzard and Epic Games alumni that has been in development since 2021. Back then, Lightforge Games was able to secure solid funding to kickstart the development of O.R.C.S., which was penned as being a cross-platform ‘social experience’ with unparalleled world-building and ‘unprecedented freedom’. </p>



<p>In one claim from the studio, Project O.R.C.S. would have offered elements of Minecraft fused with the sandbox story-telling mechanics of a TTRPG. Unfortunately, those intense levels of creativity won’t be realised anytime soon, as this all-remote studio is effectively being sunsetted.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matteo522_we-will-be-pausing-development-of-project-activity-7194026536188977152-AnGC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement on LinkedIn</a>, the CEO of Lightforge, Matt Schembari, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While today is a sad day for Lightforge, I’m very proud of the work we’ve done and the team we’ve built over the past four years. We always knew this was an ambitious long-shot of a project, but we pursued it because of a shared passion in collaborative storytelling and with a fearlessness to do something different both as a project and as a studio.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nothing was ever revealed about Project O.R.C.S., but the project still managed to pick up an eager following as gamers and prospective fans flocked to the veteran-backed capabilities of this new studio. Sadly, it was further confirmed by Lightforge Games that the community’s Discord server and social media profiles will be shut down (perhaps temporarily) while an effort to regroup takes place.</p>



<p>Dropping to a ‘skeleton crew’ means that Lightforge Games intends to return in the future, but at this tentative time, nothing is being guaranteed.</p>

<p>"At this stage, we cannot say anything more about the successor to Nintendo Switch," Furukawa said when asked why that term was used specifically. "For today's announcement, we determined that the most appropriate expression to use was 'successor to Nintendo Switch.' Information will be released in stages leading up to the launch, as we have done with previous new hardware announcements."</p><p>While Switch sales boomed during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage presented new challenges for Nintendo as it struggled to meet demand. For the Switch 2, Nintendo doesn't "anticipate" this to be a problem ahead of the launch of the Switch 2. At the same time, Nintendo's sales forecast for the financial year doesn't currently factor in Switch 2 sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-window-still-uncertain-despite-nintendos-earnings-news-analyst-says/1100-6523313/" data-ref-id="1100-6523313">but that could change in time</a>.</p><p>Nintendo says it is also being "somewhat ambitious" with its hardware sales forecast for the current financial year and it plans to implement various initiatives to sell the forecasted number of Nintendo Switch consoles and games. Part of this strategy also reveals why Nintendo took so long to confirm the Switch 2, as it was concerned that the announcement could negatively impact sales of available Switch consoles.</p><p>"We do not think the announcement of the successor to Nintendo Switch and future related communications will have zero impact on Nintendo Switch sales," Furukawa said. "However, we hope to maximize sales this fiscal year by maintaining a good balance between new demand and demand for multiple systems."</p><p>For its 2023-2024 fiscal year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sales-slide-as-console-enters-its-eighth-year/1100-6523232/" data-ref-id="1100-6523232">Nintendo said that Switch hardware declined</a> by 12.6% year-on-year from 17.97 million to 15.70 million. Lifetime sales for the Switch are at 141.32 million consoles sold, and on the software side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-switch-games-of-all-time/2900-5070/" data-ref-id="2900-5070">1.235 billion games have been sold</a>. Out of all those games, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has emerged as Nintendo's best-selling game of all time--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-nintendo-best-selling-game-of-all-time/1100-6523297/" data-ref-id="1100-6523297">with one minor caveat</a>--and the company has confirmed that it will host a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-june-but-dont-expect-to-see-switch-2/1100-6523221/" data-ref-id="1100-6523221">Nintendo Direct in June</a>. Just don't expect details about its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2 console</a>, as this event will be focused purely on what Switch fans can expect to play in the second half of the year.</p>

On the eShop, you'll regularly spend $24 on this DLC bundle, while Wingspan is regularly $20--so getting everyone for just $40 is a pretty solid deal.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>If you're unfamiliar with Wingspan, the goal of the strategic card game is to discover and attract birds to your wildlife preserves. Depending on how you build your preserves and what birds flock to your property, you can set off chain reactions that lure other winged creatures to you, earning additional points.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><em>This Week in Business is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/topics/this-week-in-business">our weekly recap column</a>, a collection of stats and quotes from recent stories presented with a dash of opinion (sometimes more than a dash) and intended to shed light on various trends. Check every Friday for a new entry.</em></p>
<p>The big news this week was Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">taking an axe to the ZeniMax studio system</a>, shutting down Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Redfall studio Arkane Austin, and Mighty Doom maker Alpha Dog Studios. Roundhouse Studios will also cease to exist, with Microsoft saying the team will join ZeniMax Online Studios.</p>
<p>People often associate layoffs with a struggling company that must get rid of people because it doesn't have the money to pay them anymore. That is absolutely not the case here. This is at least the fourth round of layoffs at Microsoft in the past year-and-a-half, a span which has been the most profitable stretch in the company's history.</p>
<blockquote>This is at least the fourth round of layoffs at Microsoft in the past year-and-a-half, a span which has been the most profitable stretch in the company's history</blockquote>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | $20.2 billion – The average of Microsoft's reported quarterly profits since Q2 FY23 (the three months ended December 31, 2023), when it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/hundreds-laid-off-at-microsoft-as-part-of-structural-adjustments">laid off less than 1,000 people</a>. That was followed in January of 2023 by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-laying-off-10000">layoffs for 10,000</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-cuts-1900-staffers-from-its-games-division">cuts of an additional 1,900 game division employees</a> in January of 2024, and this week's closures and cuts.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | $15.8 billion – The average of Microsoft's reported quarterly profits for the 11 quarters before that, the period stretching back to the beginning of the pandemic, which was already a boom time for the company.</p>
<p>Wow, Microsoft sure does make a lot of money. Fortunately, the company is re-investing all that money into its operations to improve the business further, right?</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | $8.4 billion – Microsoft returned $8.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in its most recently completed quarter. Because why would you want to invest in things or keep successful and productive studios around when you can essentially burn that money to goose the share price a bit?</p>
<p>But that's Microsoft as a whole, and the Xbox doesn't seem to be going quite as well. It doesn't seem to have meaningfully changed its market share, and things are tough all over for the industry. At least that's what everyone tell us, with years of eager investment and across-the-board growth replaced not by an industry-wide crash but expectations of mild near-term declines and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/newzoo-global-games-market-expected-to-grow-to-189bn-in-2024">more modest growth for the foreseeable future</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The thing that has me most concerned for the industry is the lack of growth. And when you have an industry that is projected to be smaller next year in terms of players and dollars, and you get a lot of publicly traded companies that are in the industry that have to show their investors growth – because why else does somebody own a share of someone's stock if it's not going to grow? – the side of the business that then gets scrutinized is the cost side. Because if you're not going to grow the revenue side, then the cost side becomes challenged." – In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108700/phil-spencer-interview-2024-xbox-exclusives-layoffs">an interview with Polygon last month</a>, Phil Spencer says that when the growth stops, cutting costs is the way to go.</p>
<p>It was a nice bit of "line must go up" candor from Spencer, but of course, that's not exactly how Xbox executives communicated the news of this week's cuts internally.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "These changes are grounded in prioritizing high-impact titles and further investing in Bethesda's portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds which you have nurtured over many decades. To double down on these franchises and invest to build new ones requires us to look across the business to identify the opportunities that are best positioned for success." – Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty, in an email to Xbox staff (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">reprinted by IGN</a>) informing them of the closures.</p>
<blockquote>Nobody likes the realization their employers would shove their entire professional lives into a furnace without hesitation if there was an outside chance it would nudge the share price up</blockquote>
<p>That's some sharp linguistic jujitsu to keep morale up. After all, nobody likes coming face-to-face with the realization their employers would shove their entire professional lives into a furnace without hesitation if there was an outside chance it would nudge the share price up. But if you can convince them this carnage is for their own benefit as well as shareholders? That's a C-Suite skill right there.</p>
<p>"Look, it's just the company getting rid of some dead weight so it can put even more resources behind whatever it is that you're doing! And we'll even invest in new franchises because it's important to dangle a carrot of creatively fulfilling work in front of you. After all, studies have shown that people who have given up all hope tend to be less productive than those who have only given up 95% of hope. Sure, hundreds of your old co-workers' lives have been derailed and some of them probably aren't going to bounce back from this and will be plunged into a spiral of despair that ends nowhere good, but you're still employed for the moment and you might conceivably benefit from their misery. Isn't that great?</p>
<p>"And no, when I say you might benefit, I don't mean like, with a raise or anything like that. Didn't you see the layoffs over there? <em>[Gestures in such a way as to cover up the Net Income column on the latest financial report]</em> These are lean times and you should be grateful you have a job at all. But you will absolutely benefit in that the project you're assigned to might receive the staffing and resources it needs to be something special, something that catches the industry's attention and earns critical acclaim. You know, something like Hi-Fi Rush!"</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Hi-Fi Rush was a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations. We couldn't be happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered with this surprise release." – Xbox Games Marketing VP Aaron Greenberg <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203">in April of last year</a>.</p>
<p>In an Xbox staff meeting Wednesday <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs">reported on by Bloomberg</a>, Booty also praised Hi-Fi Rush, and said Arkane Austin wasn't shut down because of the disappointing Redfall, raising questions about whether the work developers do has any bearing at all on their continued employment.</p>
<p>To hear Booty tell it, maybe it doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Booty said that the company's studios had been spread too thin – like 'peanut butter on bread' – and that leaders across the division had felt understaffed. They decided to close these studios to free up resources elsewhere, he said." – A passage from the Blooomberg report.</p>
<p>That idea was somewhat echoed in the meeting by ZeniMax's head of studios Jill Braff.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over." – Braff says the closures will make management's job easier by giving them less to manage. I'm certain that's a tremendous comfort for those they just laid off and all their rank-and-file colleagues still with the company, at least until the next time management decides it's too tough to manage all these dang employees.</p>
<p>What I'm hearing from all this is that leadership screwed up and grew the operation beyond leadership's ability to lead, and now it's time for someone to pay for that mistake because you simply cannot abide waste in any form when you're barely scraping by on $20 billion in quarterly profit. Also, the someones who will pay for it had nothing to do with those mistakes, and possibly even delivered games the company "couldn't be happier with." And even if they produced a flop, that had no bearing on the decision to shut the studio down.</p>
<h2>Burnout, baby, burnout</h2>

<figcaption>I didn't really mean that Burnout, but you know what? It still fits.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That reminds me of this <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/everything-you-never-wanted-to-know-about-burnout">very informative talk I attended at GDC 2023</a> where Take This clinical director Dr. Raffael Boccamazzo talked about six different factors that push people toward burnout.</p>
<p><strong>1. Workload</strong> - <em>Are you consistently given more work than you can realistically do? Scope creep can add to this, as can layoffs and the resulting job consolidation.</em></p>
<p>This week's studio closures might not directly apply here because the teams' work presumably is not being redistributed to others, but the multiple waves of cuts at Microsoft in the past couple years absolutely would.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reward</strong> - <em>Are you rewarded properly for your contributions? This is not just pay, but also recognition in personally meaningful ways. Pizza parties don't cut it.</em></p>
<p>I'm going to say having studios shuttered despite making games like Hi-Fi Rush creates a culture where people do not feel properly rewarded for their contributions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Control</strong> - <em>Can you affect how you work and what you work on? Are your tasks dictated from the top down, or do you have input on things like your schedule, where you work from, and so on?</em></p>
<p>On the micro-scale this will vary from person to person, but given the comments about management spread too thin, it sounds like Microsoft execs want to get more hands-on with the projects. When Redfall flopped, one problem Spencer pointed to was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/phil-spencer-were-not-in-the-business-of-out-consoling-sony-or-out-consoling-nintendo#:~:text=Spencer%20also%20suggested,of%20first%2Dparty.%22">Microsoft not taking a more active top-down role in the game's development</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Community</strong> - <em>Do people have a sense of belonging at work? Or are there divisions, subtle or overt, based on full-time or contractor status, identity, disability status, job role, or even department? Anything that reduces belonging contributes to burnout.</em></p>
<p>This could vary greatly by studio or department in such a massive organization, but Microsoft's prediliction for kicking people off the team probably doesn't foster a sense of belonging.</p>
<p><strong>5. Fairness</strong> - <em>Are the policies, rules, procedures, promotions and disciplinary measures applied equally to everyone, or are there certain people who seem to be disproportionately impacted?</em></p>
<p>This Xbox leadership team has made a number of missteps over a long stretch of time and kept their jobs while a lot of developers under them have done what was asked of them and lost theirs, so there definitely seems to be a fairness issue there.</p>
<p><strong>6. Values</strong> - <em>Are the company's goals in alignment with your values as an employee, and is the company consistently enacting its stated values? Does the company talk about putting people first but its actions prioritize profits instead?</em></p>
<p>This depends on the individuals in question, but Microsoft is pretty clearly prioritizing profits over people here, so as long as Microsoft's people also prioritize profits over themselves, everything should be fine, right?</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 6 out of 6 - The number of burnout factors that are aggravated by layoffs like the ones we've seen from Microsoft over the past couple years.</p>
<p>Xbox execs might be looking forward to an easier job with fewer teams to manage, but it will get harder in a hurry if the people remaining start burning out at an accelerated rate.</p>
<p>As if this wasn't disheartening enough, Microsoft may just be getting started, as Bloomberg reports it has begun offering voluntary severance packages for a number of staff at ZeniMax, and says people at Xbox have been told to expect further cuts.</p>
<h2>Fewer, bigger, better?</h2>

</figure>
<p>Going by the townhall discussion and Booty's email to staff, it sounds like Microsoft is pursuing a 'fewer, bigger, better' strategy that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/did-fewer-bigger-better-actually-work">a slew of third-party publishers have adopted in the past 15 years</a>, including the new centerpiece of the Xbox gaming business, the recently acquired Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 47 – The number of new releases from Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment in 2010, according to MobyGames. And we're not even counting the special editions or compilations.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 4 – The number of new releases from Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment in 2023: Crash Team Rumble, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Diablo 4, Warcraft Rumble.</p>
<p>That precipitous drop can be chalked up to the fewer, bigger, better strategy as well as its constant companion, the live service game strategy. After all, Activision Blizzard did a lot more last year than just launch four games. It also provided ongoing content updates for Call of Duty Mobile, Call of Duty Warzone, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, Diablo Immortal, Overwatch 2, and more.</p>
<blockquote>The 'fewer, bigger, better' strategy Activision Blizzard has embodied is almost directly opposite the strategy Microsoft has been taking for years</blockquote>
<p>The thing is, the 'fewer, bigger, better' strategy Activision Blizzard has embodied is almost directly opposite the strategy Microsoft has been taking for years now.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "I don't want to seem like we're going out to fill a quota. It's not about filling a spreadsheet by any means. We will, however, have an interest in studios right now that fit this criteria of 50-to-100 people, who are making games on a two-to-three year cadence, and have content that we think will be of interest to our Game Pass subscribers. That means content that is a little different to what our big AAA franchises can deliver." – In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-xbox-bought-ninja-theory">a 2018 interview</a>, Booty explicitly says the company strategy was not fewer, bigger, better but more, smaller, and… well, the intent was probably not worse, but let's say different. (And of course, there would still be those big AAA franchises like Halo, Gears of War and the like.)</p>
<p>What Booty is describing there as the ideal acquisition candidate is not very far at all from Tango Gameworks. From 2014 to 2023, the studio released five games, which lines up with that two-to-three release cadence. There was The Evil Within and its sequel, Ghostwire: Tokyo, the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/06/hero-dice-to-end-service-on-august-31-in-japan">short-lived</a> mobile game Hero Dice, and Hi-Fi Rush. The studio put out consistently well-reviewed titles that stood out from the crowd, even if they weren't blockbuster hits.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks would have fit right in with the slew of studio pick-ups Microsoft made dating back to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-super-sizes-first-party-studio-system">its 2018 E3 presentation</a> when it announced the acquisitions of Ninja Theory, Playground Games, Compulsion Games, and Undead Labs, purchases which were followed within a year by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-to-acquire-rpg-specialists-obsidian-entertainment-and-inxile">Obsidian Entertainment and InXile</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-buys-double-fine-productions">Double Fine Productions</a>.</p>
<p>With the exception of Forza Horizon developer Playground (currently working on Fable), those studios were acquired to make exactly the kind of smaller games Microsoft's strategy now seems to be turning away from. And with word that there are more cuts on the way, I don't know why any of them should feel secure in their future with Microsoft.</p>
<blockquote>Who even knows what would please these people?</blockquote>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "We need smaller games that give us prestige and awards." – As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">The Verge</a>, Booty emphasized in yesterday's town hall meeting that Microsoft still wants games like the smaller, prestigious, and award-winning Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>Who even knows what would please these people? They say they're focusing their resources on bigger games, then they say they need smaller games. They say they love your games, then they shut your studio down. They make more money than they've ever made before, then they cut costs repeatedly, drastically, and cruelly. They buy more studios than they can manage, so the answer is not to use that aforementioned money to hire more (or perhaps better) managers, but to have fewer studios so management's job can be easier.</p>
<p>Never mind feeling secure, I'm not sure why anyone who works for Microsoft would feel anything other than the Sword of Damocles hanging above their heads every moment of every day, a sword held in place not by something as tangible as a hair but by something as mercurial as an executive whim.</p>
<h2>The rest of the week in review</h2>
<p>Microsoft didn't say how many people were involved in this week's cuts, so we tried to ballpark it ourselves with some publicly available (but outdated and unofficial) numbers.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 126 – The number of different Tango Gameworks employees credited on MobyGames for Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 156 – The number of different Arkane Austin employees credited on MobyGames for Redfall (four of them on a contract basis).</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | Under 30 – The number of Alpha Dog Games employees with LinkedIn profiles.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 38 – The number of different Roundhouse Games employees credited on MobyGames for Redfall. It's unclear if developers at the Wisconsin-based Roundhouse will be allowed to work remotely once they are integrated into ZeniMax Online Studios or if they are being asked to relocate to Maryland to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>It looks like we're talking about 300 to 350 people at those Bethesda studios who lost their jobs this week.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "For years, Microsoft has been talking about finding the next billion gamers. It was promising a future filled with different games, reaching different audiences, through different channels and with new ways of paying for it all. With every passing announcement, I grow concerned that it's giving up on that dream." – Our own Chris Dring has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-do-studio-closures-mean-for-xbox-strategy-opinion">his own thoughts on the Microsoft layoffs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "On the larger end, it feels like it's crushing under its own weight a little bit. The consumers are so tied up in some of these really fantastic live service games, but there's only so much time they can spend. So there are more and more huge games being launched asking for an enormous amount of time, but there's just not that much time available for people to play." – Devolver Digital co-founder Nigel Lowrie <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/devolver-co-founder-says-large-scale-game-dev-crushing-under-its-own-weight-a-little-bit">said some things to us at GDC</a> that make me think Microsoft chasing the 'fewer, bigger, better' approach is going to do a lot more to bolster the number of obscenely expensive AAA games that faceplant than it will do to show the kind of growth Microsoft shareholders demand.</p>
<p>Microsoft might be investing a ton of money into big new games intending to steal players and engagement from Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto Online, or Roblox, but how much of the ground it gains in that attempt will come at the expense of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Minecraft?</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | $1.66 billion - EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-madden-have-ea-posting-full-year-growth-despite-sleepy-q4">announced plans to repurchase $5 billion of EA stock over the next three fiscal years</a>, which averages out to $1.66 billion each year.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 52% - $1.66 billion of stock repurchases this year would be 52% more than the high end of EA's forecast for net profits for the entire fiscal year, which top out at just $1.09 billion.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Based on our early assessment, we believe that more than 50% of our development processes will be positively impacted by the advances in generative AI." – EA CEO Andrew Wilson says <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-believes-over-50-of-its-development-processes-will-be-positively-impacted-by-gen-ai">generative AI will make the company a whole lot more efficient</a>.</p>
<p>Just think of how much more EA stock could then be bought back with all those savings!</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 85,000 – The number of LinkedIn followers of Amir Satvat, a business development director at Tencent who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/meet-amir-satvat-the-man-leading-efforts-to-find-laid-off-developers-new-jobs">started publicizing game job openings and job-hunting resources a year and a half ago</a>.</p>
<p>It is beyond depressing that there is so much demand for such things right now.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | $270 million – Roblox's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-revenues-increase-to-801m-in-q1">net losses in the first quarter of 2024</a>. It has never had a profitable quarter, and it is expecting to lose more than $1 billion over the course of 2024.</p>
<p><strong>STAT</strong> | 20% - Nintendo is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-profits-rise-to-62bn-ahead-of-quiet-year">forecasting a 20% drop in revenues</a> for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, suggesting some very lean times ahead. And while it hasn't ruled out a Switch successor launch entirely, it has only said the system <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">would be announced during this fiscal year</a>, and its projections <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-no-switch-2-before-april-2025">do not factor in any contributions from such an offering</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "PC/console PUBG: Battlegrounds saw its monthly active users and sales reach the highest figures since the F2P transition in 2022." – In announcing earnings with sales up 24% year-over-year and profit up 30% year-over-year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-sees-a-24-sales-increase-for-q1">Krafton's quarterly earnings</a> show that some companies in the industry are still growing just fine.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Banning TikTok is so obviously unconstitutional, in fact, that even the Act's sponsors recognized that reality, and therefore have tried mightily to depict the law not as a ban at all, but merely a regulation of TikTok's ownership." – TikTok, in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/07/1246532784/tiktok-ban-us-court-biden-congress">its legal challenge to the US' recently adopted law</a> forcing Chinese company ByteDance to sell the platform by January or have it banned in the US.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "More often nowadays, we witness video game soundtracks being right there at the top of the charts of soundtrack productions. I can tell you that the Baldur's Gate 3 soundtrack was at the top of Amazon, iTunes, months after its release, to the surprise of everyone including myself! And when I say charts I don't mean the video game music charts, I'm talking about film, musical, every single soundtrack production out there." – In speaking with Marie Dealessandri at the Game Music Festival in London, Larian composer and music director Borislav Slavov <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/from-the-last-of-us-to-baldurs-gate-3-the-success-of-the-game-music-festival">reflects on the strides game music has made in recent years</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "I feel compelled today to let my industry friends know that I left DeepWell late 2023, along with almost all of the games industry colleagues I brought to that company. [I] have absolutely nothing to do with the game they released today on the Quest store (which they called Zengeance) and which my colleagues also asked to have their names removed from." – Former DeepWell co-CEO Mike Wilson <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mike-wilson-leaves-deepwell">doesn't seem to have parted on good terms</a> with the mental wellness gaming company he co-founded two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Due to technical issues at the launch of Helldivers 2, we allowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network account to be temporarily optional. That grace period will now expire." – Sony last week, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-psn-log-in-requirement">trying to pull the ol' live service switcheroo</a> and impose a new requirement on Helldivers 2 PC players, even though the game was being sold in dozens of countries where you can't create a PlayStation Network account.</p>
<p>I particularly like how they frame the lack of account linking as an act of benevolence, suggesting customers should not be outraged that they were charged full price for a game they will no longer be able to play just a few months after release. No, instead they should be thankful for a "grace period" during which the company allowed them the honor of playing the game without Sony dictating absolutely every last aspect of the experience.</p>
<p>So how'd that go over?</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Helldivers fans – we've heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update." – Sony struck a very different tone in <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1787331667616829929">its Sunday night announcement</a> saying that, upon reflection, it had decided not to be an indefensible dirtbag on this issue and would not be mandating the account linking after all.</p>

            <p>Xbox president Sarah Bond says that Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">shuttering of four Bethesda studios</a> is to ensure the firm's business is "healthy for the long term."</p>
<p>The comment came from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIpc8VZ3Bnw">recent interview with Bloomberg's Dina Bass</a>, as the executive noted that while 2023 saw big game releases, growth in the games industry was still flat, and the cost of AAA titles continues to rise.</p>
<p>Bond was asked how consumers should understand the shuttering decision in terms of the firm's commitment to developing exclusive games.</p>
<p>She said, "When we looked at those fundamental [industry] trends, we feel a deep responsibility to ensure that the games we make, the devices we build, the services that we offer are there through moments even when the industry isn't growing and when you're through a time of transition."</p>
<p>"The news we announced earlier this week is an outcome of that, and our commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term."</p>
<p>The executive also said that Microsoft still has a commitment to having its own studios and working with partners to deliver games large and small.</p>
<p>Currently, the Xbox president said that it is focused on helping the people impacted by the studios' shuttering and to help them through the "hard transition."</p>
<p>Bass' next topic was the closure of Tango Gameworks. She asked if a studio releases a title such as Hi-Fi Rush, which won awards and was well received, shouldn't that ensure a game maker's future?</p>
<p>In response, Bond said, "One of the things I really love about the games industry is it's a creative art form. It means that the situation and what success is for each game and studio is also really unique, like there's no one size fits all to it for us.</p>
<p>"We look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with sort of making decisions and, and trade-offs like that...but it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games."</p>

<p data-characters="324" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Slowly but certainly, Valve continues its long trudge towards making <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/linux-steams-second-most-used-os-possibly-due-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamOS</a> the very best gaming-focused operating system.

Here’s a (slightly) truncated summary of what’s coming to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/steam-deck-hub-everything-you-need-in-one-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Deck</a> with this version of the SteamOS:</p> <ul data-found-items="16" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="877" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">A more up-to-date Arch Linux base, with Linux kernel now at version 6.5</li> <li data-index="1">Updated GPU driver to Mesa 24.1, leading to performance and rendering correctness improvements</li> <li data-index="2">Updated KDE Plasma to 5.27.10 in Desktop mode</li> <li data-index="3">Added Steam Deck LCD BIOS overclock controls</li> <li data-index="4">SD cards can now be used as the default boot devices</li> <li data-index="5">Improved Apple AirPod pairing experience</li> <li data-index="6">Improved session recovery speed after GPU crashes</li> <li data-index="7">SanDisk microSD card misdetection workaround</li> <li data-index="8">Improved speed of subsequent OS updates</li> <li data-index="9">Enabled support for Bluetooth A2DP and BAP profiles</li> <li data-index="10">Resolved the issue with an accrual of temporary files while using Flatpaks</li> <li data-index="11">Improved Bluetooth connection speed with some devices</li> <li data-index="12">Improved performance and stability in memory pressure use cases</li> <li data-index="13">Resolved the problem with the performance UI automatically turning itself on</li> <li data-index="14">Improved display uniformity (Mura compensation problems), color balance, and yellow tinting issues under some conditions</li> <li data-index="15">Improved Steam UI responsiveness</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">For a full list of fixes and boons, be sure to check out Valve’s full patch notes, but what we outlined above should give you a sense of what’s waiting for you in the Deck’s Preview update channel. On that note, it’s worth remembering that the ‘Preview’ build of SteamOS isn’t fully stable, and you shouldn’t necessarily expect a flawless and entirely bug-free experience if you opt into it. For that, wait for SteamOS 3.6 to be pushed into the stable content pipeline instead, which may happen in a few weeks’ time if all goes well.</p>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="false">In the broader handheld gaming news, a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-new-rog-ally-is-in-the-works-will-be-designed-for-enthusiast-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new model of the ASUS ROG Ally</a> is now in production. Designed for “enthusiast” gamers, the ROG Ally X is to the baseline ROG Ally what the OLED Steam Deck is to the LCD Steam Deck: expect a substantially improved battery and a revamped shell, but not a generational leap in performance. This makes sense, too, as the hardware necessary to deliver a truly substantial performance boost at low wattages simply isn’t there. Not yet, at least!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="351" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You wouldn’t think a high-ranking video game executive would get involved in internet squabbles. When was the last time you saw Phil Spencer or Jim Ryan reply to a mean Tweet or Facebook post? Well, it turns out Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser isn’t above calling someone out on social media… and on LinkedIn of all places.</p> <p data-characters="588" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">It wasn’t even related to anything with Nintendo or its games, but airplane etiquette. Chad R. posted a short rant on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rogerschad_rtmof-miracleofflight-activity-7189823099603750913-W5QQ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> about how people on airplanes “do not have the right” to touch other passengers’ seat backs, even for stabilizing or raising themselves. The argument was driven home by a bizarre AI image and a reassurance that “the seat you are in is yours.” The appropriately named <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/1cniz6v/nintendo_ceo_vs_linkedin_lunatic/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedInLunatics subreddit</a> by user PKLeor shared it, and the ensuing debate was spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-doug-bowser-president-linkedin-debate-comments-1851467763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, likely for Doug Bowser’s surprisingly blunt response.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Bowser called Rogers’ comment “rather arrogant and entitled,” pointing out how some passengers “may be challenged moving to their seat” due to physical limitations or the narrowness of the seating areas. He also asked, “Where on your ticket purchase documentation are your ‘rights’ to the seat back or other ‘rules’ you speak of declared?”</p>
 <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Surprisingly, Rogers clapped back, saying, “Entitled would be indicating you own everything not elucidated on a ticket on contract. Manners are [clear], happy to help you out on them with the post.” To which Bowser replied with, “Manners are different from rights. I do see the arrogance is still prevalent however. Have yourself a good day,” which very much reads as him realizing he has better things to do than keep arguing with a guy who gets this mad about people touching his plane seat.</p>
 <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="false">If you check the original post, you’ll see Bowser’s comments are strangely absent, meaning either Bowser or Rogers deleted them. Someone has also since shared Kotaku’s coverage in the comments section, and it’s clear Rogers refuses to back down from his stance, adding, “Video game nerds seem to not know the basic of flight manners.” Think we can all hope that we’ll never share a flight with this guy.</p>

<p data-characters="324" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With <em>Hades 2</em> having just launched on Early Access, we might be waiting a little bit until we finally get to consume a little merch. However, if the new title reinvigorated your passion for the original and you find your home bereft of <em>Hades </em>branded goods, then you can still get on merchandise featuring Zagreus and friends.</p> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">Here are some of the great material objects that will help build a physical bridge between you and the <em>Hades </em>series.</p> <h2 id="h-10-hades-itself" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/G6BHqC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>10.

 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">With everything pushing digital these days, physical media has started to feel like a luxury. But if the internet one day imploded (we can only hope), wouldn’t you still want to play <em>Hades</em>? Thankfully, you can get the game pressed into plastic, just like the good old days.</p> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, as of right now, the Switch version seems to be elusive. The <a href="https://geni.us/G6BHqC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S versions are still available</a>, but it seems physical <em>Hades</em> is out of print, so you probably don’t want to hesitate.</p>

I’ll cop to that. <a href="https://geni.us/YkfBcF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Mythos: The Greek Myths Retold</em> </a>isn’t actually <em>Hades </em>merch, but knowing more about the Greek pantheon will enhance your enjoyment of the game, I guarantee it. However, a lot of it can be dry, much of it contradicts other tales, and the density of its imagery can be very confusing. So, to make things easier, you can learn it through the words of comedian Stephen Fry.</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">There are actually three books (the fourth is out soon), but Mythos is the first and focuses on the basic mythology, so you’ll probably get the most mileage out of it. If you don’t like reading or touching paper, there is also an audio book read by Stephen Fry himself.</p> <h2 id="h-8-developing-hell-the-making-of-hades-blu-ray" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/hades-documentary-blu-ray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><mark><span>8.

 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">Speaking of enriching your enjoyment of <em>Hades</em>, why not take a look at the work that went into the famed roguelite? <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/hades-documentary-blu-ray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Developing Hell: The Making of Hades</em> </a>is a two-disc Blu-Ray set that takes you through the game’s development from conception to execution.</p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">The bad news is it is not available quite yet. It’s coming this summer according to Fangamer. However, if you can’t wait, the Blu-Ray set is actually a compilation of the six-part<em> </em>series done by Noclip, which is available via their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-THgg8QnvU4JEVov1tMlFThNYS92F8uC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

That’s why you get a dark color: so it doesn’t show your mistakes. So, it was a good choice by Fangamer to lean on darker colors; especially brown, the color of our favored beverages.</p>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/hades-game-desk-mat?_pos=1&amp;_sid=4bf43787d&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hades</em> Administrative Desk Mat</a> is 35” x 16” with a rubber backing making it perfect to slide beneath both your keyboard and mouse.

 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">Pins are pretty great. You can stick ‘em on your bag. You can pin them to your hat. Or both – I do both. Fangamer has a pack of <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/hades/products/hades-character-heads-pin-set-1-combo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four pins based on <em>Hades </em>characters</a>. Pin set 1 feature Zagreus, Megaera, Nyx, and Thanatos. They feature a cute chibi look, and I think Thanatos is flirting with me.</p> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">There are other pins you can get. Personally, I want Hypnos because I really like sleeping. However, you only get a deal when you buy the characters that I just listed. Bummer, but maybe that will get updated later.</p>

 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">In all seriousness, physicality is a great way to make the music you listen to more meaningful. It’s also available on CD, but the 4LP vinyl gives you great big cover art to admire. The standard edition is pressed onto smoky grey, but iam8bit sells a special edition directly <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/hades-original-soundtrack-4xlp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from their site</a> that features a smoke red version of the vinyl.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hi-fi-rush-is-being-review-bombed-but-it%E2%80%99s-not-what-you-think.867369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>review bomb is underway, but for once, it's not the negative kind of review bomb. Instead, players are flocking to the game's Steam page to show their love.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Microsoft made the unexpected decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">close down four of its studios</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks (as well as&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin, mobile dev Alpha Dog, and co-development outfit Roundhouse).</p>
<p>That decision was met with consternation by fans, and it also seemingly blindsided many of those studios' staffers; indeed, a&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>update allowing offline play was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-offline-mode-update-report">apparently in the works</a> prior to Arkane Austin's closure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-review-bomb-cityscape.jpg?itok=LcLT8dtE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-review-bomb-cityscape.jpg?itok=8ggaKzzf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9ce71746-bb20-4e2f-81e1-82f1005f6e5f" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-review-bomb-cityscape.jpg?itok=8ggaKzzf" alt="Chai leaping over a cityscape in Hi-Fi Rush" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>'s vibrant PS2-style action is getting some love on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>In response to Microsoft's decision (as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">occasionally baffling</a> attempts the company has since made to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-president-sarah-bond-responds-to-bethesda-studio-cuts-points-to-lack-of-industry-growth-and-need-to-manage-the-business-through-this-moment-of-transition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">justify said decision</a>), players have been showing up on&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>'s Steam page to give the game some love.</p>
<p>Since the studio closure announcement was made,&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>has seen a massive uptick in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">positive reviews</a> on its Steam page, with several hundred players praising the game and criticizing Microsoft in equal measure.</p>
<p>While it's certainly true that the review bomb is a relatively modest one, especially when compared to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>review bomb</a>, it's still nice to see people turning out to give&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>its props.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the review bomb is unlikely to cause Microsoft to reverse its decision, as some reviewers are calling for, but it might show the corporation that closing studios in this manner in future won't be received well by the public.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="IrsFCl">Avowed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24091333/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-anime-inuyasha">anime afficionado Megan Thee Stallion</a> dropped her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKQY2ZlIEjY">new video for “BOA”</a> on Wednesday, delivering a love letter to her nerdiest late-’90s and early aughts influences. That includes no shortage of shout outs to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952977/scott-pilgrim-vs-world-movie-comic-changes">Scott Pilgrim</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23845804/one-piece-explained-anime-manga-netflix-live-action">One Piece</a>, Dance Dance Revolution, and the 3D fighting games of the era. </p>
<p id="dvDpPG">“BOA” is dripping with serpentine flavor; that includes nods to ye olde Nokia classic <em>Snake</em> and an homage to the endless runner — or is that Crash Bandicoot? — on which Megan rides a giant white snake. But it’s the fighting game references to Mortal Kombat and Tekken that will further endear the FGC to Ms. Thee Stallion: She dresses up <em>just</em> like Christie Monteiro from Tekken and as a sort of mashup of Mortal Kombat’s Mileena and One Piece’s Boa Hancock as she violently slays the kids playing her video game like some sort of vengeful Jumanji spirit. (I’m also wondering if Megan’s video includes a more recent Mortal Kombat reference to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23780171/mortal-kombat-1-roomba-johnny-cage">Johnny Cage’s off-brand Roomba</a>.)</p>
<p id="6TFkdU">Then there’s the Dance Dance Revolution and Gantz-inspired stages and outfits, the latter of which will probably make “BOA” something you shouldn’t watch in front of the kids. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6xhm5SuhYT">Asks one Instagram commenter</a>, “Sis is your whole poonanny out???” (It is not.)</p>
<p id="EkxFti">Megan Thee Stallion has been quite open about her love of manga, anime, and video games, thanks to her cosplays of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CkZfxnnvQLC/">Mirko from <em>My Hero Academia</em></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4BDJ3cxXNi/">Bruno Bucciarati from <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em></a>. She’s also clearly a fan of the PlayStation 2-era of fighting games, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6gd2QuOAj9/">we now know</a>, and I look forward to more of Megan’s nerding out in whatever form it takes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="mshAoK">A sequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23832124/romantic-comedy-rom-com-guilty-pleasure-red-white-and-royal-blue"><em>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</em></a> is in the works from Prime Video. Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez are both reprising their roles as Prince Henry and Alex Claremont-Diaz, Matthew López, director and writer of the first film, returns to write the script. And for anyone who’s worried that the sequel movie might not capture the book’s spirit, don’t worry — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23828451/red-white-royal-blue-casey-mcquiston-fanfiction-movie">author Casey McQuiston</a> will also be co-writing the script.</p>
<p id="JyAoBQ">Based on the immensely popular romance novel of the same name, <em>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue </em>follows a fictional prince of England and U.S. president’s son who fall in love after some wonderful rivals-to-friends-to-hook-up-buddies tension. The movie adaptation changes a few details, but otherwise is a pretty faithful recreation of the story which charmed many hardcore fans of the book. </p>
<p id="lCAsrN">There’s no release date or plot details for the sequel, but if you’re itching for a rom-com in the mean time, Prime Video’s latest one, <em>The Idea of You</em>, also stars Galitzine (this time alongside Anne Hathaway). And if you’re hungry for more queer rom-coms specifically, McQuiston’s newest book, <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/news-and-features/articles/new-novel-by-casey-mcquiston-coming-in-2024/"><em>The Pairing</em></a>, is out on Aug. 6. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-president-addresses-bethesda-studio-closures-says-its-about-keeping-business-healthy-long-term.867357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/xbox-is-shutting-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more">Xbox closed four Bethesda studios</a>, including <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/redfall/a-life-draining-trip-to-new-england">Redfall</a> developer Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, the team behind last year's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/hi-fi-rush/riff-city">Hi-Fi Rush</a>. While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, four days later, <em>Bloomberg's </em>Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIpc8VZ3Bnw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Here's what Bond said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's always extraordinarily hard when you have to make decisions like that. I'll go back to what I was saying about the industry, and when we look at those fundamental trends, we feel a deep responsibility to ensure that the games we make, the devices we build, the services that we offer are there through moments, even when the industry isn't growing and when you're through a time of transition. And the news we announced earlier this week is an outcome of that and our commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"With that said, our commitment to having our own studios and working with partners to have games large and small – we're a platform where you can play [Grand Theft Auto], but you can also play Palworld, or you can play Call of Duty or you can play Pentiment, that doesn't change. And frankly, our commitment to Bethesda and the role that it plays is a part of Xbox and everything we do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's actually been pretty fantastic. I don't know if you've gotten a chance to check it out. The Fallout TV show was on Amazon, and it's been great to see people fall in love with that universe but also what it's done for the games themselves, and people going back and exploring everything inside of that. There are some other great things that are coming from our studios later this year. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – I was a big Indy fan growing up – so you should check that out. But really right now, for us and our teams, our focus is on the people impacted and doing everything that we can do to help them through this hard transition."</p>

<p>Bass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203">Xbox's own admitted metrics</a>, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One of the things I really love about the games industry is it's a creative art form, and it means that the situation and what successes for each game and studio is also really unique. There's no one-size-fits-all to it for us. And so we look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with making decisions and trade-offs like that. But it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games we create, the devices we build, the services, and ensuring we're setting ourselves up to be able to deliver on those promises."</p>

<p>While it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/v-rising-impressions-vampire-survival-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-blooded survival game</a>, <em>V Rising</em> tasks the player with securing an increasingly complex array of resources and tools to keep up with the hostilities of the world. It’s all fairly straightforward until you find yourself needing a steady supply of Whetstone, which is a tad more hands-on.</p> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">Notably, there are two different ways to get the Whetstone: one is challenging if you’re underequipped, and the other is totally random and unreliable. Whichever option you end up going with, though, it’s crucial that you stock up on as much Whetstone as possible in the early <em>V Rising</em> progression loop, as that’s the only way to properly start building up your castle and secure a foothold for yourself.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/V-Rising-Grayon-the-Armourer-Whetstone-Blood.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/V-Rising-Grayon-the-Armourer-Whetstone-Blood.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/V-Rising-Grayon-the-Armourer-Whetstone-Blood.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/V-Rising-Grayon-the-Armourer-Whetstone-Blood.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/V-Rising-Grayon-the-Armourer-Whetstone-Blood.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-whetstone-in-v-rising" data-injectable="false">How to get the Whetstone in V Rising?</h2> <p data-characters="69" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">So, to get Whetstone in <em>V Rising</em>, you can do either of the following:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"> <li>Scour Bandit Camps wherever you find them, hoping to find some Whetstone.</li> <li>Secure a Whetstone crafting blueprint from one of the V-Blood bosses and make as many as you need.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">The good news is that, if you’re only just starting out, it only takes a little luck until you find some Whetstones lying about. The boss that has the Whetstone crafting blueprint isn’t <em>too</em> big of an issue, either, though you’ll obviously need to get some solid gear before taking him on. In other words, then, you’ll need to rely either on sheer luck or on your skill to get some Whetstones going, and I recommend the latter.</p>
 <h3 id="h-where-is-the-whetstone-crafting-recipe" data-injectable="false">Where is the Whetstone Crafting Recipe?</h3> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">The Whetstone Crafting Recipe is held by none other than Grayson the Armourer, as illustrated by the screenshot featured above. This is a relatively early-game boss, and you’ll need to face him in combat sooner or later if you want to progress through the game at a decent pace.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">Grayson shouldn’t pose <em>too</em> much trouble if you’ve kept up with your gear upgrades up until that point: beating him with level 24 or 25 gear is fairly straightforward as well, and it is recommended that you use whatever spell tokens you secured up until then to unlock solid crowd control abilities to keep Grayson’s mooks at bay while you deal with him. Ice spells, in particular, should work wonders in this regard.</p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve drained Grayson the Armourer dry, you’ll have access to the Whetstone Crafting Recipe:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"> <li>1 Copper Ingot</li> <li>12 Stone Dust</li> </ul> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">This nets you <em>two</em> Whetstones in one go, so it’s a solid investment no matter how you flip it. And, once again, you <em>will</em> need loads of Whetstones to keep moving upwards in <em>V Rising</em>‘s steep power structure.</p>
 <h3 id="h-what-is-the-whetstone-used-for-in-v-rising" data-injectable="false">What is the Whetstone used for in V Rising?</h3> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Whetstones are essentially a progression blocker in <em>V Rising</em> if you don’t have ready access to a bunch of them. The most obvious upgrade unlocked by Whetstones is the Grinder station, which allows you to create bricks and build out a proper vampire castle to hide out in.</p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">You’ll also need a hefty number of Whetstones to unlock the ‘Merciless’ versions of Copper weaponry. The Merciless Copper Crossbow, for example, will need a whopping <em>12</em> Whetstones alone, which should illustrate our point.</p>
 <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false">Yet, once you’ve taken Grayson down a few pegs and have the Whetstone Crafting Recipe in tow, getting a solid stock of Whetstones in tow should be simple and easy.</p>

            <p>
As I have now casually mentioned in about 400 news posts, I'm moving flat soon. During the quest for a new flat - a quest I would slot somewhere between return to Ravenholm in Half-Life 2 and the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief: Deadly Shadows in terms of overall hopefulness and unpleasant surprises - I toyed briefly with the idea of living in a mobile home.</p>
<p>You can find all kinds of weirdo moving property on Gumtree - houseboats, caravans, yurts, large coats, coffins - but they all share the disadvantage of being cramped and more expensive than described and inadequate to the power and internet needs of a Maxed-Out Videogame Journalist. If I'd seen a house with chicken legs, though? It'd have been worth the sacrifice. Just think, whenever James Archer gives me grief about my performance in Lethal Company I could send my house to step on him.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
To live in a house with chicken legs you ideally need to be a witch. A witch like Reka, protagonist of the new PC fantasy exploration game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reka">Reka</a>, in which you can summon ravens to gather mushrooms, curse the townsfolk, brew potions and feed berries to dancing wooden effigies. Reka <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1737870/REKA/">now has a demo</a>, which I have just tried to play on my crumbling work laptop (the review PC is in storage - for the 402nd time, I'm moving flat soon!) only for it to freeze up like Magrat Garlick talking to Granny Weatherwax. What I've played so far feels very promising, however. 
</p>
<p>
Reka takes place in an ancient European forest, at the golden zenith of autumn, and I'm immediately enraptured by the spectacle of the low sun breaking through the trunks. It's reminiscent of, yes, I'm going to at once misrepresent and overhype this - Breath Of The Wild. There are hints of survival sim here - collect three sticks and six honeycombs, etc - but nothing like the usual day one lemming-rush to fell a million trees (on the Steam page, the developers position Reka as "a rich exploration game with base building and crafting elements").</p>
<p>It doesn't look like you'll be fashioning much in the way of hand-tools and gear; rather, you'll forage for brewing materials, items for use in spellcraft, and materials for your big gawky rooster of a witch's hovel. I haven't managed to build a chickenhouse yet, but Reka's world is perfectly absorbing even when traversed using your pitiful, non-reverse-jointed human legs and feet. It feels like a place of intrigue, reverie and enchantment, all things I tend to favour over scrounging the parts for an Upgraded Tanning Rack.
</p>
<p>
The demo includes the character generator and the first part of the game, which is due for release this year - I'm not sure whether progress carries over to the full thing. It's running as part of the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/ludonarracon">LudoNarraCon Steam festival</a> from 9th to 13th May. If you spy any LudoNarraCon demos that seem worth a write-up, I encourage you to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-7th-10th-may-2024">feed them to the Maw</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="X3UZA8">Right now, every industry faces discussions about how artificial intelligence might help or hinder work. In movies, creators are concerned that their work might be stolen to train AI replacements, their future jobs might be taken by machines, or even that the entire process of filmmaking <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/openai-sora">could become fully automated</a>, removing the need for everything from directors to actors to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23767640/ai-mcu-secret-invasion-opening-credits">everybody behind the scenes</a>. </p>
<p id="FIv7Lf">But “AI” is far more complicated than ChatGPT and Sora, the kinds of publicly accessible tools that crop up on social media. For visual effects artists, like those at Wētā FX who worked on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24152022/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em></a>, machine learning can be just another powerful tool in an artistic arsenal, used to make movies bigger and better-looking than before. <em>Kingdom</em> visual effects supervisor Erik Winquist sat down with Polygon ahead of the movie’s release and discussed the ways AI tools were key to making the movie, and how the limitations on those tools still make the human element key to the process.</p>
<p id="BKRYfQ">For the making of<em> Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>, Winquist says some of the most important machine-learning tools were called “solvers.”</p>

<p id="AKx8l2">“A solver, essentially, is just taking a bunch of data — whether that’s the dots on an actor’s face [or] on their mocap suit — and running an algorithm,” Winquist explains. “[It’s] trying to find the least amount of error, essentially trying to match up where those points are in 3D space, to a joint on the actor’s body, their puppet’s body, let’s say. Or in the case of a simulation, a solver is essentially taking where every single point — in the water sim, say — was in the previous frame, looking at its velocity, and saying, ‘Oh, therefore it should be here [in the next frame],’ and applying physics every step of the way.”</p>
<p id="doQI5n">For the faces of <em>Kingdom</em>’s many ape characters, Winquist says the solvers might manipulate digital ape models to roughly match the actors’ mouth shapes and lip-synching, giving the faces the vague creases and wrinkles you might expect to form with each word. (Winquist says Wētā originally developed this technology to map <a href="https://www.wetafx.co.nz/films/case-studies/thanos">Josh Brolin’s Thanos performance</a> onto a digital model in the Avengers movies.) After a solver works its magic, the Wētā artists get to work on the hard part: taking the images the solver started, and polishing them so they look perfect. This is, for Winquist, where the real artistry comes in. </p>
<div id="mzhh7x"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXXWZ9tXzcE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Wpj27m">“It meant that our facial animators can use it as a stepping-stone, essentially, or a trampoline,” Winquist explains with a laugh. “So [they can] spend their time really polishing and looking for any places where the solver was doing something on an ape face that didn’t really convey what the actor was doing.”</p>
<p id="W05eIF">Instead of having to painstakingly create every single lip-sync and facial tic, the artists focus their time on crafting the depths of emotional nuance that the solver couldn’t handle. This lets them do more careful and detailed work than might have been possible when those earlier stages had to be done by hand.</p>
<p id="64ieqP">While most of the AI tools that have garnered concern online are trained by pulling thousands of pieces of art posted on the internet by artists who haven’t given their permission for that use — and subsuming their styles and elements in order to build its vocabulary — Wētā’s tools are trained in-house, solely on the studio’s own work, according to Winquist. </p>

<p id="BUEbXA">“There’s so much gray area around copyright ownership, and ‘Where do they scrape all this information from?<em>’</em> Right?” Winquist says. “The places where we’re using machine-learning in our pipeline, the algorithm essentially is being trained on our information. It’s being trained on our actors, it’s being trained on the imagery that we’re feeding it, that we’ve generated. Not imagery from wherever.”</p>
<p id="YAtH9u">The solver tools, which Winquist and his team built and refined on each movie Wētā has worked on, enable the studio to take on more ambitious projects and scenes than they could have in the past. For instance, the massive set piece at the climax of <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> is a scene Winquist isn’t sure they could have done without the team’s newest generation of water-solver software. Those tools, unsurprisingly, were refined during production on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23506051/avatar-2-way-water-review-james-cameron"><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em></a>. Winquist notes that the work was a step up from the water scenes in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/26/15872420/war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em></a>, the previous film in the franchise. </p>
<p id="C7HssA">“We would have struggled,” Winquist says. “I would say if we had not done those previous films, there would have been a big push in R&amp;D to get us up to scratch.”</p>

<p id="xV2OYZ">Winquist goes on to describe the incredible complications of <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>’ various water scenes: One takes place on a bridge over a raging river, and another involves a massive flood of ocean water. According to Winquist, <em>Way of Water</em>’s water solver was key to getting these scenes off the ground, because it allowed the effects artists to simulate how the water would respond to certain elements, like the ape characters and their hairy bodies, without fully rendering those scenes in a computer.</p>
<p id="XN52hx">This allowed art directors a chance to tweak the scene before the rendering took place, making quick adjustments possible. Previously, computers might have needed nearly three days to fully render all the CG details on a scene before the effects team could watch the results, tweak the algorithms, then start the process over again. That made this kind of CG scene virtually impossible to refine in the way the Wētā team could with this movie.</p>
<p id="AnSfQc">But for all the ways AI technology proved essential on <em>Kingdom</em>, Winquist still sees it as nothing more than an empty tool without the artists who guide it and pin down the finished product. </p>

<p id="Rpg1jU">“I don’t want to overshadow the human element,” Winquist says. “I’ve seen approaches where the facility has really gone in deep on the machine-learning side of things, and it feels like that’s where it stopped. I see the result of that, and I just don’t believe that voice coming out of that face or whatever. The thing I find we’re so successful with is that the artists are ultimately driving [the finished scenes], using the machine-learning stuff as a tool, instead of the answer to the problem.”</p>
<p id="jInMN9">For Winquist, that human element will always be key to producing something great and artistically interesting. </p>
<p id="Kmd0KF">“Ultimately, [machine-learning tools] can only regurgitate what they’ve been fed,” he says. “I don’t know. Maybe I’m a Luddite, but I just don’t know if there’s ever a point where that stuff can meaningfully make [a movie] truly engaging — a piece of art that somebody is going to want to actually sit down and watch. The thing I always go back to is, <em>Why should I bother to read something that somebody couldn’t be bothered to write?</em> Whether it’s words or whether it’s images.”</p>

An announcement, billbil-kun said, is set for sometime in May.</p><p>God of War: Ragnarok launched on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in November 2022 and was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">a monster hit with critics</a> and players. It became the fastest-selling first-party game in PlayStation history, shifting 5.1 million units in its first week. As of November 2023, God of War: Ragnarok had sold over 15 million copies. Last year's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla">Valhalla DLC</a> was equally well-received. A PC release this fall would come two years after the game’s console debut.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla</h3></div></output><p>Sony has form when it comes to launching its games on PC, with Guerrilla’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>, and Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-1">The Last of Us Part 1</a> all launching on Steam in recent years. Sucker Punch’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> launches on PC on May 16 having launched on PS4 in July 2020.</p><p>This is all part of Sony’s increasing push to make more of its PlayStation games by releasing them on PC also, but it has so-far resisted the temptation to follow in Microsoft’s footsteps by launching its console exclusives on PC at the same time. There have been a handful of exceptions, however. This year’s smash hit shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> launched on PC and PS5 with cross-play, but it’s worth noting that Arrowhead’s game revolves around co-op and live service, as opposed to single-player story.</p><p>Sony is yet to comment on the latest report, but rumors are swirling that it is set to host a State of Play broadcast in May.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-set-revealed-twilight-masquerade-where-to-buy">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet's Twilight Masquerade</a> expansion releases on May 24. This is one of the most exciting Pokémon TCG expansions in recent memory; as while there are some supremely-powerful cards to consider, this only emphasizes even more strategy. You'll be playing fire with fire, but there are still plenty of counters and exciting ways to get the upper hand thanks to useful ACE SPEC cards, or the compelling new additions having some clear downsides.</p><p>Twilight Masquerade features a slew of cards that will cause a storm in Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet and could trouble opponents from every corner of the trading card game. So, instead of waiting for the light screen to fall, we've been lucky enough to get hands-on with a Wailord's worth of new Twilight Masquerade cards, boosters, elite trainer sets, and more. Let's dig in.</p><h2>Pokémon TCG Twilight Masquerade - Build and Battle Box</h2><p>Available from May 11, the Build and Battle Box box is designed to offer a competitive edge right out of the gate. It includes <strong>four booster packs and a 40-card deck</strong>, augmented by one of four unique foil promo cards—Thwackey, Infernape, Froslass, or Tatsugiri. These cards enhance your deck and dictate your strategy for any pre-release events, making each box a personalized starting point for exploring the new set. It's affordable, and the perfect option for anyone after an easy pick-up-and-go deck. <a href="https://zdcs.link/R0x28" target="_blank"><strong>You can preorder from Amazon for $19.97 (MSRP: $24.99).</strong></a></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-twilight-masquerade-expansion-build-and-battle-box-2-1715339500213.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Pokémon TCG Twilight Masquerade Build and Battle Box (Infernape) - Credit: Christian Wait" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-twilight-masquerade-expansion-build-and-battle-box-2-1715339500213.png?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>Pokémon TCG Twilight Masquerade Build and Battle Box (Infernape) - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p>We scored Infernape in our Build and Battle box, which looks stunning. It has a unique artwork that differs from the standard Infernape Twilight Masquerade card, alongside the foil stamp found on all Play and Battle promo cards. Its moves are also the same as the standard card, but it seems like it will still burn rivals with ease. The Pyro Dance ability allows players to add a Fire and Energy card to a trainer's Pokémon, while its only attack, Scorching Fire, does 200 damage and requires players to discard a fire energy. Its energy cost is one colourless and two fire, so players could evolve and set this attack up in one turn, thanks to Infernape's ability.</p><p><strong>Twilight Masquerade Build and Battle Box Contents:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 Twilight Masquerade booster packs</li><li>A 40-card ready-to-play deck featuring key cards from current and prior sets</li><li>One of four unique foil promo cards; Thwackey, Infernape, Froslass, or Tatsugiri</li></ul><h2>Pokémon TCG Twilight Masquerade - Elite Trainer Box</h2><p>The new Elite Trainer box includes everything to jump-start your journey into the Twilight Masquerade. It features eight booster packs, 65-themed card sleeves to protect your new cards, various gameplay accessories like dice and acrylic markers, and a player's guide that provides invaluable insights into the set's strategic depth. The box is also a collector's item with a beautifully designed storage solution. <a href="https://zdcs.link/EylbP" target="_blank"><strong>You can preorder from Amazon - $39.02 (MSRP: $49.99).</strong></a></p><p>Elite Trainer boxes really are a great bundle for starter trainers and Pokémon masters alike. For making their first deck, rookie trainers will get everything they need to start their first battle. The included sleeves always have an excellent design, protecting those rare trainers' deck stars. Star of the box, Ogerpon, has a form for almost any trainer, from quickly setting up its Teal Mask to the powerhouse Hearthflame form that does more damage when it's close to getting knocked out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Pokémon TCG Twilight Masquerade Elite Trainer Box - Preview</h3></div></output><p>The box is a brilliant way to organise and store extra Pokémon cards, and is immediately useful for anyone starting the hobby. A brilliant change to recent elite trainer boxes is dice with damage values instead of the classic dots, it just makes life easier when keeping track of damage in-game -- and it's also nice to see proper plastic damage counters instead of the pop-out cardboard ones!</p><p><strong> Twilight Masquerade Elite Trainer Box Contents:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>8 Twilight Masquerade booster packs</li><li>65 card sleeves featuring a specific Pokémon from the set</li><li>45 Pokémon TCG Energy cards</li><li>A player's guide to the Twilight Masquerade expansion</li><li>6 damage-counter dice</li><li>1 competition-legal coin-flip die</li><li>2 acrylic condition markers</li><li>A collector's box to hold everything, with 4 dividers to keep it organised</li><li>A code card for the Pokémon TCG Online</li></ul><h2>Pokémon TCG Twilight Masquerade - Booster Box</h2><p>This staple product for collectors and serious players <strong>contains 36 booster packs</strong>, each with 10 cards and one basic energy, ensuring a substantial boost to your collection. The Booster Box is ideal for potentially uncovering the full range of Twilight Masquerade's offerings, from the elusive ACE SPEC cards to the new Pokémon ex variants. <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BJ4q" target="_blank"><strong>You can preorder from Amazon - $113.40 (MSRP $129.99).</strong></a></p><p>Across the Booster, Elite Trainer, and Build and Play Boxes, we opened <strong>48 Twilight Masquerade Booster Packs</strong>. Including EX, full art, and ACE Spec cards, we pulled 18 rares - tracking at around 37.5% chance. The epic pulls in this set are unreal, with the Secret Box ACE Spec tool card allowing trainers to search for one of every type of Trainer card to add to their hand. Here are some of our favorites overall: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Teal Mask Ogerpon EX:</strong> Its Teal Dance ability allows trainers to drop an extra Grass energy onto Ogerpon per turn. Myriad Leaf Shower, its only attack, causes a base of 30 damage multiplied by how many energy cards are attached to both Ogerpon and the opponent's active Pokémon.</li><li><strong>Dragapult EX:</strong> Its Phantom Drive attack causes 200 damage plus 6 damage counters worth 60 damage for an opponent's benched Pokémon for one fire and one psychic energy. Mental scenes!</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-twilight-masquerade-expansion-booster-box-5-1715336535411.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Applin (left), Dragapult EX (centre), Lairon (right) - Credit: Christian Wait" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-twilight-masquerade-expansion-booster-box-5-1715336535411.png?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>Applin (left), Dragapult EX (centre), Lairon (right) - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon EX: </strong>Talk about a powerhouse! Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon EX shines when it's nearly knocked out and would pair brilliantly with the ACE Spec card Survival Brace. Wrathful Heart does 20 damage multiplied by each damage counter on Ogerpon, causing a maximum of 400 damage if left with 10 HP. Its secondary attack, Dnamic Blaze, causes 140 damage with an extra 140 damage ready for evolved enemy Pokémon. </li><li><strong>Bloodmoon Ursaluna EX:</strong> Looking for a Pokémon to pull out when one's back is against the wall? Bloodmoon Ursaluna EX is the best choice. Its Ability, Seasoned Skill, allows trainers to knock off one energy cost off its only attack, Blood Moon, based on how many prize cards an opponent has taken. If an opponent has five prize cards, trainers can attack with Blood Moon for free.</li></ul><h2>What Are The Key Features of Twilight Masquerade?</h2><p><strong>Innovative Card Mechanics:</strong> Twilight Masquerade introduces a series of new gameplay mechanics with the debut of six different Ogerpon cards, each offering unique strategies based on the masks from the Teal Mask video game DLC. This includes four powerful Pokémon ex cards, each designed around a different mask, allowing for dynamic gameplay that can adapt to various situations during a match. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-twilight-masquerade-expansion-preview-2-1715340278121.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Heliolisk (left), Secret Box ACE SPEC (centre), Teal Mask Ogerpon EX (right) - Credit: Christian Wait" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-twilight-masquerade-expansion-preview-2-1715340278121.png?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>Heliolisk (left), Secret Box ACE SPEC (centre), Teal Mask Ogerpon EX (right) - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>ACE SPEC Cards: </strong>Continuing the reintroduction from the previous set, Twilight Masquerade includes new ACE SPEC cards—rare and powerful Trainer and Special Energy cards that can significantly influence the tide of battle. These cards are limited to one per deck and are designed to offer players game-altering abilities that can be pivotal in competitive play. </p><p>ACE Spec Cards give trainers a one-time chance per game to turn the tide. With our earlier example of Hearthfire Mask Ogerpon, Survival Brace ensures a Pokémon doesn't faint and keeps 10 HP. It's a clever spin to put on the TCG and keeps gameplay spicy!</p><p><strong>Rich Illustrations and Rare Finds: </strong>The set promises over 160 cards before secret rares, featuring a mix of Illustration Rares and Special Illustration Rares. These cards are not only a draw for collectors due to their stunning artwork. </p><p>They also add a unique flair to gameplay, featuring fan-favourite Pokémon in unique poses and settings. With new Pokémon ex and Tera Pokémon ex cards, players can also expect a varied and exciting lineup. This includes new entries such as Bloodmoon Ursuluna ex and others from The Teal Mask expansion, each bringing their unique abilities and potentially shifting the competitive meta.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-twilight-masquerade-expansion-preview-1-1715340193140.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Lucian (left), Iron Thorns EX (centre), Survival Brace ACE SPEC (right) - Credit: Christian Wait" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/pokemon-tcg-twilight-masquerade-expansion-preview-1-1715340193140.png?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>Lucian (left), Iron Thorns EX (centre), Survival Brace ACE SPEC (right) - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet, Twilight Masquerade is a master course on how to spice up a trading card game without breaking it. Rather than introduce new gimmicks, a few new cards that pack a good punch with equally risky weaknesses only raise the stakes in battle. </p><p>Boosters seem to have a fair rare card pull rate which some might not agree with. But if Ace Spec and EX cards were easy to get, it would take the challenge away for trainers. Overall, there's a lot to like about Twilight Masquerade, including an exciting return to no-holds-barred battles.</p><div><div id="200457"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet-Twilight Masquerade Build and Battle Box" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/10/ign-single-cms-59-1715342640908.png?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet-Twilight Masquerade Build and Battle Box</h3></p><div><p>Includes: 4 Twilight Masquerade booster packs, 40-card ready-to-play deck,

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft’s decision to release some of its Xbox games on rival console the PlayStation 5 appears to be paying off, with Rare’s pirate adventure <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> topping Sony's sales chart.</p><p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/09/playstation-store-april-2024s-top-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony revealed that Sea of Thieves was April’s most-downloaded PS5 game from the PlayStation Store in the EU, ahead of the likes of GTA 5 and Helldivers 2, and the third most-downloaded game in the U.S. Given Sony’s download chart does not include free-to-play games such as Fortnite, we can say Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 game on the PlayStation Store in April, and right up there in the U.S.</p><p>There’s more good news for Microsoft’s controversial multi-platform push. Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> also features highly in both the EU and the U.S. Elsewhere, Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> tops the PlayStation 4 chart for April in both the EU and the U.S. Fallout 4 also makes the EU top 10 PS5 list off the back of its recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-next-gen-update-performance-review-ps5-vs-xbox-series-xs">next-gen update</a>. Fallout 4’s newfound success is of course fueled by the breakout hit <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV show</a>, but steep discounts will have helped, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>And let’s not forget Activision’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3</a> is also an Xbox game, now Microsoft owns Activision Blizzard. Overall, four of the top 10 games in Europe are Xbox games: Sea of Thieves, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Grounded and Fallout 4.</p><p>The success of Sea of Thieves on PS5 in particular may vindicate <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future">Microsoft’s decision to bring some of its games to rival consoles</a>, a decision that sparked much debate within the Xbox core fanbase. It seems likely Microsoft will release more of its Xbox games on PS5 and, potentially, the Nintendo Switch and its successor console. The question now is, which games are next?</p><p>Microsoft has so-far used games released over a year ago for its multi-platform push, as opposed to brand new games. With that in mind, perhaps one of the Forza games will speed onto PS5. Microsoft is heavily rumored to be ready to announce the next mainline Gears of War game, as well as a Gears collection. Could Gears Roadie Run onto PS5, too?</p><p>The most dramatic move would be to bring Halo to PlayStation. But would Microsoft actually go through with it? As former Xbox boss Peter Moore recently told IGN, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">Microsoft will be debating whether to bring Halo to PlayStation as we speak</a>. Perhaps we’ll find out during Microsoft’s Xbox showcase event in June.</p><p>All this comes amid devastating cuts across Microsoft’s gaming business, and after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the shock closure of Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks and Redfall studio Arkane Austin</a>. In a recent interview, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-president-sarah-bond-responds-to-bethesda-studio-cuts-points-to-lack-of-industry-growth-and-need-to-manage-the-business-through-this-moment-of-transition">Xbox president Sarah Bond insisted</a> the closures were about ensuring the Xbox business remains healthy for the long-term during what she called “this moment of transition.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely.</p><p>You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates.</p><p>However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone?</p><p>Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Choose How You Want to Follow the Game’s Story</strong><ul><li>The complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. You can concentrate on just one particular character’s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character.</li><li>You can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline – essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause.</li><li>Or you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Watch and Change Things as Many Times as You Like</strong> – Can’t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you’re not sure you like the consequences? That’s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like.</li><li><strong>Change the Past to Affect the Future</strong> – Setting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events. As you look back through the timeline, past events play out in front of you in ghostly form, with the smoke and fire damaged house a constant reminder of what is to come. In addition, as you manipulate the past, the environment can be reset around you to match the changes taking place. Some new objects will appear, others will move around the house and the contents of rooms can change substantially as you change the past.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Eternal Threads | Coming to Xbox, PlayStation &amp; Nintendo Switch May 23rd" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VutKhf8SqeU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Prince of Persia fans will have to wait a little longer for the next spin-off to arrive, as Evil Empire has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rogue-prince-of-persia-builds-on-dead-cells-formula-wall-running/1100-6522522/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> has been slightly delayed beyond its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-from-dead-cells-dev-announced-launching-in-may/1100-6522555/">planned May 14 release date</a>. This is partly due to the Dead Cells developer working on polishing up lingering bugs ahead of the game's early-access launch and the studio aiming to avoid being overshadowed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-everything-we-know-about-supergiants-upcoming-roguelite/1100-6520218/" data-ref-id="1100-6520218">Hades 2</a>. The Hades sequel also launched in early access this month, and so far, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/" rel="nofollow ">the game has had a strong debut</a>. Evil Empire says it will announce a new release date for The Rogue Prince of Persia on May 13.</p><p>"Seeing as everyone and their mum is playing that game--including our entire team...and their mums--we have decided to let people have their fun with it before we release The Rogue Prince of Persia," Evil Empire said in a statement. "While we have every confidence in The Rogue Prince of Persia, it's not every day that a game in the same genre as you, which is one of the most anticipated upcoming games of 2024, will release into Early Access a week before you plan to do the same. We are not prideful enough to ignore the implications of that, and we truly believe that this short delay is the best decision for us and our Early Access journey. We also want to give Hades 2 a head start before we start running, it's only fair."</p>

<p>Evil Empire even broke the news with a yellow background on its social media post, a running trend that Cyberpunk 2077 fans are painfully familiar with. The studio says it'll use the extra time to fine-tune its day-one patch and "add more stuff" before launch. "We completely understand that this is annoying news to hear for everyone who was eager to play the game, especially so close to the anticipated release. We can only hold our hands up, apologize, and hope that you understand," Evil Empire added.</p><p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is the second spin-off releasing this year in the franchise, following the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> in January. This new game is a 2D action-platformer in a similar vein to Dead Cells, and features wall-running elements that players will utilize to navigate through procedurally generated levels. There'll also be a chunky arsenal of weapons to master, like axes, swords, and daggers, while secondary weapon options include shields and grappling hooks.</p>

                <p>While we already know that Microsoft's first-party games are included in Game Pass on launch day, Xbox leadership has once again reiterated that fact.</p><p>In an interview with Bloomberg at <a href="https://youtu.be/oIpc8VZ3Bnw?si=cb7dshC0jE5ys2DG&amp;t=830" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg Tech</a> in San Francisco, Xbox president Sarah Bond said, "You're going to see some more really big games going into Game Pass later this year" The interviewer interjected to say "from Activision?" and Bond replied, "Across the whole slate."</p><p>This suggests that the next Call of Duty game will be added to Game Pass on launch day, even though there are reports that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-on-game-pass-is-not-guaranteed-microsoft-having-internal-debates-about-it-report/1100-6523291/" data-ref-id="1100-6523291">Microsoft is internally debating</a> on whether to go down that route. Some theorize that putting future Call of Duty releases onto Game Pass could negatively impact the game's sales.</p><p>With its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now under much more financial scrutiny to make good on the $69 billion cost. Microsoft is also reportedly considering raising the price of Game Pass Ultimate. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Microsoft shut down several of its studios</a>, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.

The next game is rumored to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-will-reportedly-be-black-ops/1100-6519417/" data-ref-id="1100-6519417">Black Ops title</a>, and will be available on all platforms, including PlayStation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/lexclusivite-playstation-god-of-war-ragnarok-sortira-bientot-sur-pc-50164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, reliable leaker billbil-kun claimed that God of War Ragnarok  is getting a PC announcement sometime soon.</p>



<p>The report estimates that the PC version will be “announced sometime in May 2024,” loosely translated. It adds that the announcement could arrive during a new PlayStation showcase, which is also possibly coming this month. </p>



<p>Dealabs also mentions that it could not confirm a release date for God of War Ragnarok’s PC version, though it points out the original’s 2022 launch date.</p>

<p>God of War Ragnarok is one of PlayStation’s most prized exclusive titles. However, PlayStation will release Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut for PC next week on May 16. So, there is a precedent for similar plans.</p>



<p>Despite some mixed feelings about PSN, Ghost of Tsushima’s new PC version will surprisingly include both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-trophies-overlay-coming-to-ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation trophies and an overlay</a>. It’s unclear if these PC features will extend to a title like God of War Ragnarok.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun has successfully leaked a variety of industry news and other imminent announcements. This includes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-death-stranding-2-news-imminent-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 claims</a> from January 2024. Soon after, Death Stranding 2 did get a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new story trailer</a>.</p>



<p>So, it is very likely that the God of War Ragnarok announcement is coming. However, nothing is confirmed, and PlayStation did not officially tease or reveal anything yet.</p>



<p>The God of War series continues to thrive, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-show-script-writing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-action series</a> is even in the works, first revealed during Sony’s CES 2024 panel.</p>

                <p>Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closed multiple Bethesda studios</a>, including Tango Gameworks, the developer of the well-received rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush. Xbox executive Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, recently reacted to and explained the company's decision to close the outfit. The game might have won numerous awards, but the company doesn't have a one-size-fits-all approach to defining success, she said.</p><p>Reporter Dina Bass asked Bond this question: "One of the shuttered studios in particular just created a hit game; it did really well on Game Pass in terms of engagement and won a ton of awards. Shouldn't succeeding in that way ensure the future of a studio?"</p><p>She was no doubt referring to Hi-Fi Rush, and Bond answered by saying Microsoft takes a number of factors into consideration when attempting to define what "success" is for a given game or project.</p><p>"One of the things I really love about the games industry is that it's a creative art form. It means that the situation, and what success is for each game and each studio, is also really unique. There is no one-size-fits-all to it for us," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIpc8VZ3Bnw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she told Bloomberg</a>. "We look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with making decisions and trade-offs like that. But it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games we create, the devices we build, the services, and ensuring we're setting ourselves up to be able to deliver on those promises."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIpc8VZ3Bnw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oIpc8VZ3Bnw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb reported after Hi-Fi Rush's release that the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critically-acclaimed-hi-fi-rush-didnt-make-the-money-it-needed-to-make-report/1100-6513467/" data-ref-id="1100-6513467">"straight up didn't make the money it needed to make."</a> Xbox boss Matt Booty reportedly said the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-more-award-winning-games-like-hi-fi-rush-just-fired-everyone-who-made-hi-fi-rush/1100-6523309/" data-ref-id="1100-6523309">needed more smaller-scale games that win awards</a> just a day after it fired everyone who made Hi-Fi Rush.</p><p>Also during her chat, Bond talked about how the video game industry, in large part, has remained "flat" in terms of revenue for the past few years. 2023 had a number of "tremendous" game launches, Bond said, but at the same time, "the growth didn't follow all of that." This softness has occurred at the same time that game development costs and timelines are growing, Bond said.</p><p>"All of that has been happening at the same time that the cost associated with making these beautiful, AAA blockbuster games is going up. And the time it takes to make them is going up. So much of our focus as Xbox is about how we do things to help the industry all up, while also ensuring our brand--everything we do--is there through this moment of transition," she said.</p><p>Regarding the closure of Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Games (which is merging with ZeniMax Online Studios), Bond said the decision was "extraordinarilyy hard." Closing studios and laying off staff helps Xbox have a "healthy" business, Bond said.</p><p>"When we looked at those fundamental trends we feel a deep responsibility to ensure the games we make, the devices we build the services we offer are there through moments, even when the industry isn't growing. When you're going through a time of transition," she said. "The news we announced earlier this week is an outcome of that and our commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term. </p><p>Bond pointed out that Xbox is home to large-scale games like Grand Theft Auto and relatively smaller titles like Palworld and Pentiment, and "that doesn't change" going forward. Bond also noted that Microsoft is not giving up on Bethesda (which is no surprise given Microsoft spent $7.5 billion to buy its parent company, ZeniMax).</p><p>"Frankly our commitment to Bethesda and the role that it plays as part of Xbox and everything we do [is not changing]. Really right now for us and our teams, our focus is on the people impacted and doing everything we can do to help them through this hard transition," she said.</p><p>Prior to closing the four Bethesda studios this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">Microsoft cut thousands of jobs within Xbox and Activision</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer defended the cuts, saying investors want to see growth. Laying people off is a way to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">help appease investors and improve the overall Xbox business</a>, he said.</p><p>"You get a lot of publicly traded companies that are in the industry that have to show their investors growth--because why else does somebody own a share of someone’s stock if it's not going to grow?--the side of the business that then gets scrutinized is the cost side. Because if you're not going to grow the revenue side, then the cost side becomes challenged," he said.</p><p>Layoffs at Xbox are "really an outcome of an industry that's not growing," Spencer said. He went on to say he sees better days ahead.</p><p>"It can grow and it will grow again. But you see this time right now and the implications have human impact. And we should all reflect on that and think about it," he said.</p>

                <p>Turn-based RPGs aren't nearly as prevalent as they once were, but when you find one that nails the charming loop of hits from the genre's heyday, it's a nostalgic treat to be savored. Sea of Stars is a prime example of just that, and fans of the genre can finally grab a physical edition of last summer's buzzy turn-based RPG. At $40, the physical edition is slightly more expensive than the digital edition ($35), but it also comes with a double-sided poster.</p><p>One of the best RPGs of 2023, the physical version of Sea of Stars was put together by the retro specialists at iam8bit and comes with the aforementioned double-sided poster. A <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/sea-of-stars-nintendo-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$45 Nintendo Switch-exclusive edition</a> with alternate cover art and some extra goodies was previously available to order via iam8Bit's store. Unfortunately, that version sold out quickly, and it's easy to see why: It came with a game manual, collectible slipcase, four sticker sheets, and the complete soundtrack.</p><p>The edition that's

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dead Cells developer Evil Empire has delayed its upcoming roguelike, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, because of Hades II. Originally due out on Tuesday, May 14, in PC Early Access, Evil Empire has delayed the game to later this month to give potential players more time with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/06/hades-ii-is-now-available-in-early-access-on-pc">Hades II</a>, which is another roguelike that hit Early Access this week (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/05/06/cover-reveal-the-making-of-hades-ii">and it's also gracing the latest cover of&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>Magazine</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJhZAvXILI4" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"So it's been a bit of a crazy week for us," a <a href="https://x.com/Studio_Evil/status/1788886708064317943">statement</a> from Evil Empire reads. "It all started when a little game called Hades II released – you might have have heard of it? Seeing as everyone and their mum is playing that game (including our entire team...and their mums), we have decided to let people have their fun with it before we release The Rogue Prince of Persia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will still be releasing in May and will be back with a precise date on Monday. While we have every confidence in The Rogue Prince of Persia, it's not every day that a game in the same genre as you, which is one of the most anticipated upcoming games of 2024, will release into Early Access a week before you plan to do the same. We are not prideful enough to ignore the implications of that, and we truly believe that this short delay is the best decision for us and our Early Access journey."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team says this extra time will be used to polish The Rogue Prince of Persia even more, add "even more cool things," and fix some bugs. It also notes the Day One patch for the game was getting big and this extra time will give the team more time to test it (and lower the team's stress as a result).</p>

<p><em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>went hands-on with the game recently and loved what we played – you can read our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/04/10/we-played-the-rogue-lite-prince-of-persia-from-the-co-developer-of-dead-cells">preview impressions of The Rogue Prince of Persia here</a>.

While we’re still waiting for Valve to give details about a possible follow-up to its own device, we’ve already seen that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lenovo-next-gen-legion-go-2-report/">Lenovo is planning a next-gen Legion Go</a>. Now, Asus is quick to follow suit.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">In the latest video from the ROG Global YouTube channel, hosts Jake Kulinski and Whitson Gordon are keen to bring us news that a new ROG Ally is currently in the works. While not all details about the upcoming device are being revealed yet, we do get a few bits of information.</p> <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="The next ROG Ally is coming..." width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vze62qJK1Sk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">For example, the next portable PC from Asus is going to be called the ROG Ally X, rather than the ROG Ally 2. What we’re being told is that the next iteration will be “more than just a basic refresh” of the current model, and that it’s going to be targeting the more “enthusiast” market.</p>  <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">It’s also worth noting that this won’t be a completely new device, either. The ROG X is basically going to be somewhere between being a refresh and a new-gen. What the next version will be is essentially a response to feedback from people who wanted a bit more.</p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">There are going to be some improvements to the current model, such as a better battery – Kulinski’s eyes even widen when he tries to express how the new battery will be “very good.” There’s also going to be improvements to the RAM and storage, as well as the ports.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">As I say, not a lot is being said right now, but there is going to be a special announcement on June 2, which will hopefully dive deeper into what you can expect from the upcoming Asus ROG Ally X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released its financial information for the fiscal year ending in March 2024, and while profits are up, the in-depth picture is a bit more complicated than that might suggest.</p>
<p>According to Sega's <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20240510_presentation_e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">end-of-year presentation</a>, profits have jumped from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-announces-strong-financial-results-plans-to-release-12-new-games-this-fiscal-year">46.7 billion yen last year</a> to 56.8 billion this year, but that increase is mostly thanks to the pachislot and pachinko side of the business, where profits have doubled since last year.</p>
<p>Gaming, meanwhile, is down from 38.7 billion yen last year to 28.9 billion this year, which Sega attributes to "loss from structural reform in Europe", likely a reference to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs">sale of&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes&nbsp;</em>developer Relic</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-cancels-hyenas-and-others">cancellation of Creative Assembly's live-service game&nbsp;<em>Hyenas</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, for example, sold a million copies within its first week on release, making it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-has-sold-1-million-copies-fastest-selling-game-in-series">the fastest-selling game</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>(nee&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>) series.</p>
<p><em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sells-over-1-million-copies-fastest-in-atlus-history">achieved the same feat</a> for not only its own series, but also publisher Atlus in general, while strategy game&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-by-vanillaware-has-sold-500000-copies">achieved 500,000 sales</a>&nbsp;within its first few weeks on release, which isn't too shabby for a niche developer like Vanillaware.</p>
<p>Although these successes are impressive, Sega still points to its pachislot business as the key reason for its profit increase this year, which makes sense; it's an area in which other publishers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-profits-financials">like Konami</a> are also heavily invested.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unicorn-overlord-sega-financials.jpg?itok=uhXOyztP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unicorn-overlord-sega-financials.jpg?itok=0aUl-Hki 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="bcaad2ce-bf98-461e-89b4-ccf96adcc183" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unicorn-overlord-sega-financials.jpg?itok=0aUl-Hki" alt="A character using the Assaulting Lance skill in Sega's Unicorn Overlord" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Vanillaware's&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>has done well despite being fairly niche.</figcaption></figure><p>Sega says that pachinko is "weak in the current situation", but that pachislot is "strong", which is probably why the company appears to be introducing its pachislot machines to the North American market.</p>
<p>One of the changes associated with Sega's new "Welcome to the Next Level" corporate plan involves "entering the online gaming market in North America", with "online gaming" here referring to pachinko and pachislot machines, as well as other physical amusements.</p>
<p>Sega's much-touted "Super Game" project, meanwhile, remains AWOL, and appears to have been delayed from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-super-game-old-ip-revived">2026</a> to 2028. According to the presentation, Sega expects said game to make a "full-scale contribution to earnings" from the 2028 fiscal year onwards.</p>
<p>In terms of Sega's future, the company is predicting a drop in profits next year owing to a "reactionary decline in pachislot and pachinko".</p>
<p>However, the release of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>, as well as the launch of a new Atlus IP (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date">presumably&nbsp;<em>Metaphor Re:Fantazio</em></a>), lead Sega to predict an increase in sales and profits across the gaming sector.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if that plays out. In the meantime, you can check out Sega's supplementary financial documents <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20240510_q4_appendix_e-1.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20240510_tanshin_e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;if you're in the mood to get seriously nerdy with your stats. Stay tuned for more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now that the<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150249/hades-2-early-access-release-date-steam-egs"><em>Hades II</em> early access period has started</a>, opening up a more complete but still early build of the game, I’ve been fighting against the urge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24135151/hades-2-technical-test-impressions">to gorge myself on it</a> — and losing. To be fair, I have a weak spirit since I loved the first <em>Hades,</em> which introduced me to the concept of roguelikes, a genre I avoided out of disdain for repetition. Also, and this is the biggest factor in my spiritual war against the game: I have a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a>, which makes not playing the game all but impossible. </p><p><strong><em>Slight spoilers for </em>Hades II <em>follow.</em></strong></p><p><em>Hades II </em>is Steam Deck-verified with a comfortable control scheme that reminds me of playing on the Switch. I did fiddle with the button mapping a little bit, swapping the buttons for dash and attack. (It’s hard to adjust when control schemes change from console to console.) But eventually, I returned to the default control scheme, because why mess with what the gods design? </p><p>One thing I’ve noticed is that <em>Hades II </em>doesn’t seem to tax my Steam Deck in ways other games have. While playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer"><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em></a><em>, </em>the system frequently ran hot, causing the fan to kick on. (I didn’t experience any frame rate issues or extreme overheating; it was just a phenomenon that happened enough for me to take note.) Not so with <em>Hades II, </em>even though it feels like the more graphically intensive game. </p><p>The one problem I do have with playing <em>Hades II </em>on the Steam Deck has nothing to do with the game at all. One is a condition I call “claw hand.” With <em>Hades II</em>, I have a tendency to play until the Deck’s battery runs low. Then, when I finally put the Deck down, my hands resist returning to a resting position, stiff and curled as though they’re still holding the Deck. This doesn’t happen with my Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, or when I spend too much time on mouse and keyboard on PC. Only my Steam Deck.</p><p>Another, perhaps too inside baseball problem, is that I can never remember how to take screenshots. I’ve been spoiled by the dedicated screenshot buttons on the other consoles and cannot remember the combo of buttons needed to capture a picture on the Deck — which is something I want to do a lot because, in case you haven’t heard, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133905/hades-2-is-once-again-hotter-than-hell">the gods are hot</a>.</p><p>I still haven’t progressed too far in <em>Hades II</em>, and I’m pretty sure it’s because my heart’s not in it. I make dumb, reckless choices in the game, while also not really choosing my godly boons or weapons smartly. The big ax weapon I just unlocked is atrocious. It does pack a significant punch, but it’s just too heavy to wield effectively, and I knew that even before starting a run with it. But I ventured forth anyway and didn’t get very far despite being able to reliably make it to the first boss.</p><p>Despite this, even a bad run in <em>Hades II</em> is still enjoyable and productive. There are always reagents to collect and cultivate in your little garden. Also, gifting the nectar you find to gods and allies rewards you with equipment that grant permanent bonuses. So although I’m not really progressing, I am building a solid foundation of strength so when it is time to deliver death to Chronos, I’ll be ready.</p><p><em>Hades II </em>feels tailor-made for the Steam Deck, and thank the gods for that because I’d hate playing if it weren’t. I played the first <em>Hades </em>exclusively on Switch, so maybe I’m just spoiled, expecting my <em>Hades</em> experience to always be portable. It is just so much more comfortable playing on the Deck, where I can chill outside or on the couch without being tethered to a mouse and keyboard. <em>Hades II</em> on Steam Deck lets me take advantage of the PC-only early access limitation without giving up the quality of gaming life I’ve become accustomed to.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
