			<p>Today, developer and publisher Tripwire Interactive announced that the next hotly-awaited title in the Killing Floor franchise will be delayed. Killing Floor 3 was initially set to release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-assassins-creed-shadows-split-fiction-and-killing-floor-3-in-march/">March 25</a>, but it's now been announced by Tripwire Interactive that the game will be delayed to an "undecided date" later in 2025. This <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update was posted</a> on the official Killing Floor 3 social media. For those who want to read it, the message is below.</p>
<p><em>Dear Killing Floor Fans,</em></p>
<p><em>We've made the decision to postpone killing Floor 3's launch to an undecided date later in 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>After taking the time to gather and discuss feedback from our recent closed beta, we've realized that we missed the mark. Our goal isn't just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you've come to know and love.</em></p>
<p><em>With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we're working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it's too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We look forward to another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3, and when we're ready to share more details, you will be the first to know. Until then, we thank you for your continued patience and overwhelming support.</em></p>
<p>In addition to this statement made, there is also an FAQ for those who have pre-ordered the game and want to know what the next step is. For those who pre-ordered and are disappointed in this news, there is <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the option for a refund</a>, if you are no longer interested in receiving the game upon launch.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 is the latest title in the beloved co-op horror FPS series. This title takes place in the year 2091, which is a whopping 70 years after the events in Killing Floor 2, where the evil megacorp Horzine has now produced an even bigger, more dangerous army of bio-engineered monstrosities that are called Zeds. In this game, you take up the role of a Nightfall specialist, a rebel rogue group that is tasked with destroying the Zeds. You'll get to unlock skills, try out new weapons, and team up with up to five teammates to battle it out for survival.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 is set to release on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.</p>

Interestingly, Jackass star Bam Margera isn't on the list and is nowhere to be seen in the debut trailer. While Activision did mention that it has more secret skaters to reveal, it looks like Margera has seemingly been cut from the roster.</p><p>While Margera found success after Jackass with skateboarding deals and the MTV series Viva La Bam, recent years have seen him deal with substance abuse and health issues. Jackass director Jeff Tremaine had originally planned to include him in the fourth film, but Margera was fired from the project and a restraining order was issued against him by the filmmaker.</p><p>The classic THPS games also featured several memorable guest characters, and while we're not certain if Darth Maul, Marvel's Wolverine, or if Officer Dick will show up, we do know that the Doom Slayer will be in the game as a digital deluxe and collector's edition bonus. An interesting fact here is that Doom Guy was originally in THPS 3's PC edition, so this is a nice bit of continuity for the remake.</p><p>Here's the full list so far of skaters in the game:</p><h3 id="Returning_skaters">Returning skaters</h3><ul><li>Tony Hawk</li><li>Bob Burnquist</li><li>Steve Caballero</li><li>Kareem Campbell</li><li>Rune Glifberg</li><li>Eric Koston</li><li>Bucky Lasek</li><li>Rodney Mullen</li><li>Chad Muska</li><li>Andrew Reynolds</li><li>Geoff Rowley</li><li>Elissa Steamer</li><li>Jamie Thomas</li></ul><h3 id="New_skaters">New skaters</h3><ul><li>Chloe Covell</li><li>Jamie Foy</li><li>Rayssa Leal</li><li>Yuto Horigome</li><li>Zion Wright</li><li>Wireframe Tony Hawk (via the digital deluxe and collector's editions)</li><li>Doom Slayer (Preorder (via the digital deluxe and collector's editions)</li><li>Revenant (via the digital deluxe and collector's editions)</li></ul><h2 id="Tony_Hawk_s_Pro_Skater_3___4_gameplay">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455172-thps34%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455172" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455172-thps34%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455172"></a><figcaption>The Hawkman returns.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455172-thps34%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>The interesting thing about these two THPS games is that they represent two very different eras for the franchise. THPS 3 was the final game for several years to use the traditional two-minute time-limit for each stage, while THPS 4 scrapped the timer and gave players the option to explore each stage at their own leisure during career mode. For Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-4s-remake-isnt-just-limited-to-two-minute-levels/1100-6529951/">Iron Galaxy is unifying the experience</a> by keeping the time-limit structure intact for both games.

            <p>
If you've been keeping up with Battlefield, you'll be aware of EA's plans to hold invite-only playtests for the series' next instalment as it seeks to avoid the kind of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">disastrous response Battlefield 2042 received</a>. And with the first of these now underway, it's perhaps not a huge surprise to learn players are already ignoring their NDAs and leaking early gameplay online.
</p>
<p>
Pretty much all we know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.
</p>
<p>
There's so much still being kept under wraps, in fact, that it's perhaps a surprise EA is willing to start playtests before anything close to a big reveal. But here we are, with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a> - described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - now live. And despite participants needing to sign an NDA before they can get involved, gameplay is already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5sf4u/new_battlefield_leaked_gameplay/">popping</a> up in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5sf4u/new_battlefield_leaked_gameplay/">various</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5tvrg/battlefield_6_gameplay_leak_11_minutes/">corners</a> of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5t4bv/battlefield_6_gameplay_leaks_2_minutes_online/">internet</a>.

<p>
Inevitably, EA is now embroiled in a game of whack-a-mole as far as the leaked gameplay is concerned, but plenty still lingers. Most of the footage surfaced so far consists of multiplayer sessions in Conquest mode, all playing out across the narrow, criss-crossing streets of what appears to be a North African city, and featuring plenty of environmental destruction.
</p>
<p>
Conquest mode was just one aspect of the new Battlefield that EA previously said it would be testing as its Labs initiative continued - with the publisher also confirming sessions will include a chance to playtest Breakthrough mode, the game's class system, and "new ideas". And with more tests to come, it's almost inevitable more leaks will follow - which might not be such a bad thing for EA after Battlefield 2042, given the gameplay currently doing the rounds seems to be garnering a tentatively positive response.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j5jbil/battlefield_labs_community_update_gunplay_and/">latest community update</a>, EA wrote, "Within Battlefield Labs, we're focused on refining the best elements from past titles, modernizing them, and validating if they feel fun and rewarding, and have the right balance between intuitive control and dynamic combat... Our goal is to offer gameplay that rewards skill with precise weapon feedback and movement options for veterans, while providing an intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy."
</p>
<p>
As to when the next Battlefield will get its full reveal, that's currently unclear - although last month, EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>.

I’ve been playing it with my wife over the last few days  and I have to agree. It’s a truly incredible game that is packed with hundreds of cool moments and ideas. And it seems we aren’t alone in loving <em>Split Fiction</em> because looking around at ever publicly available metric on hand, the game is a smash hit. </p><h2 id="h62001"><a id=""></a>Impressive Steam numbers and Metacritic scores</h2><p>First, lets look at Metacritic, which is a useful if flawed metric of how well a game is doing overall with critics across multiple sites and outlets. The review aggregator has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/split-fiction/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Split Fiction</em>, as of March 7, sitting at 91 on PS5 and 92 on Xbox and PC.</a></span> That’s damn impressive, and it’s enough to make it 2025's highest-rated game thus far. But it’s also a big deal for publisher EA, as <em>Split Fiction</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gagadget.com/en/597837-split-fiction-is-the-first-game-for-electronic-arts-in-13-years-to-receive-90-points-on-metacritic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gagadget.com/en/597837-split-fiction-is-the-first-game-for-electronic-arts-in-13-years-to-receive-90-points-on-metacritic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s first video game to score a 90 or higher</a></span> on Metacritic in 13 years. The last time that happened was in 2012 with <em>Mass Effect 3. </em></p><p>Next, we can look at Steam and how many people are playing the game on Valve’s popular PC storefront. According to the ever-reliable SteamDB, just a few hours after launch, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Split Fiction </em>had over 190,000 active concurrent players</a></span>. Wowza! That means it was as popular as Steam giants like <em>GTA V, Rust, </em>and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. That high number also set a record for EA. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s peak player count of 197,000 is the second highest concurrent number EA has achieved on Steam. Only <em>Apex Legends</em>, a free-to-play battle royale shooter, has done better. </p><p>It should also be noted that unlike most other EA games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pc-steam-third-party-ea-ubisoft-ditching-launchers-civ6-1851623212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pc-steam-third-party-ea-ubisoft-ditching-launchers-civ6-1851623212"><em>Split Fiction </em>(like 2024's <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span>) doesn’t require you to install and use a separate EA launcher to play. This is further proof that ditching third party launchers is a smart move for any publisher. </p><p>EA and Hazelight are also probably really happy that <em>Split Fiction</em> is receiving positive reviews from players on Steam. The new co-op game currently has a 94 percent positive user rating on Steam. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/publisher/Electronic+Arts/?sort=rating_desc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Electronic+Arts/?sort=rating_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That makes it EA’s fifth most well-reviewed Steam game</a></span>, only slightly behind another Hazelight co-op banger, <em>It Takes Two. </em></p><h2 id="h62002"><a id=""></a>Will EA and other publishers learn a lesson? </h2><p>While we will have to wait and see how well <em>Split Fiction</em> sells, all the currently available data shows that this is a huge home run for EA. It’s yet more evidence that smaller, more focused games (relative to stuff like <em>GTA 6</em> and <em>Starfield</em>) can succeed and blow up in a big way. And you don’t need to spend three years marketing a game for it to find success. </p><p>I also think that EA made a smart move when it decided to not lock <em>Split Fiction</em> behind some third-party launcher on PC. Instead, you buy the game on Steam and just play it. Simple, easy, and a much more appealing offer for the sometimes fickle PC playerbase. And let’s not forget that Hazelight (an independent studio, but one which relies heavily on EA’s money) being able to spend a decade now making smaller co-op games has allowed the team more time to learn and improve at their craft collectively, which means future games are likely to be better. </p><p>Now, will EA and other publishers watching learn a lesson from <em>Split Fiction</em>’s success? Will they allow studios more chances to make smaller games and not burn millions on years of marketing or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818?_gl=1*tht9in*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTM2MTY2Ni4zNi4xLjE3NDEzNzMzNDYuNDQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818?_gl=1*tht9in*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTM2MTY2Ni4zNi4xLjE3NDEzNzMzNDYuNDQuMC4w">lay off people the moment something doesn’t hit as big</a></span>?

                <p>Leaked gameplay footage of the next, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">still-untitled Battlefield game</a> is making its way online, giving fans a glimpse at what the future of the franchise will entail.</p><p dir="ltr">A small number of players are currently playing the next installment in the Battlefield franchise as part of an early <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-battlefield-labs-test-begins-this-week-report/1100-6529917/" data-ref-id="1100-6529917">Battlefield Labs playtest</a>, and though those playing are under an NDA, gameplay footage has unsurprisingly leaked online. Publisher EA, at least initially, seemed to be pulling down leaked footage of the playtest, but many clips continue to circulate online for the time being.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/large-scale-playtests-for-new-battlefield-will-start-early-next-year/1100-6526539/" data-ref-id="1100-6526539">large scale playtest</a> being described as existing so that players can give feedback on a pre-alpha version of the game, the new Battlefield looks to be fairly far along. This new entry takes place in the modern day rather than in the past (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-1/" data-ref-id="5000-454570">Battlefield 1</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-v/" data-ref-id="5000-482208">Battlefield V</a>) or the future (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>), bringing to mind the look and feel of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-3/" data-ref-id="5000-43761">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-4/" data-ref-id="5000-147664">4</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaked footage shows the classic Battlefield game mode Conquest being played on an urban map named Abbasid. The UI looks similar to that of Battlefield 2042, but also features a return to the franchise's tried-and-true class system, with players able to choose between Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon.</p><p dir="ltr">Destruction looks to be back in a big way as well. Footage shows more detailed environmental destruction than in Battlefield 2042, with a single rocket able to completely decimate a building as upper floors collapse onto themselves. While Battlefield 2042 did feature destruction (a series staple), it was more limited, with many of the game's buildings unable to be collapsed.</p><p dir="ltr">That's all to say it's about what you would expect from a Battlefield set in the modern day. Movement looks to be slower compared to something like Call of Duty or even previous Battlefield games, though that is something that could definitely be tweaked from the playtest to the full version of the game. There's also a fair number of visual bugs (flickering and debris floating in the air), but as this is an early test, much of that is to be expected.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1897938457378291779" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, the official Battlefield account outlined some of the key features being tested as part of this first Battlefield Labs playtest, namely gunplay and movement. The new Battlefield's servers will feature 60Hz tick rates to ensure the game "more frequently updates the positions and actions for all players," and will display bullets faster after pressing fire to "decrease input delay, make shooting feel more responsive, and helps you better track and hit moving targets."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/what-avowed-gets-right-and-wrong-about-loot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's one thing that everyone can agree on when it comes to game mechanics, it's that if loot is present, then it has to be enticing enough for players to actually want to loot it. Of course, what this means in practice depends on a game-to-game basis, and the results aren't always clear cut. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" rel="nofollow">Obsidian's approach to loot in their latest RPG, <em>Avowed</em></a>, has demonstrated that even developers as experienced as they are can make mistakes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the underlying basics are more or less the same across every RPG. The traditional approach to loot and gear progression is linear upgrades. In other words, one tier of gear will always be better than another tier. Eventually, you are funneled into a handful of equipment options which are objectively the best in the game.</p>

<p>Historically, most RPGs have linear gear progression because it's the simplest way to design gear and convey power levels to players. <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow">Skyrim</a> </em>demonstrates this methodology very well as it's immediately obvious that the Iron armor and weapons from the start of the game are nowhere near as powerful as Ebony or Daedric tier equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downside of linear loot systems is that they are predictable. You're generally going to need an auxiliary mechanism to present the illusion of choice and variety. <em>Skyrim </em>does this via enchanting, alchemy, smithing and crafting, and semi-random loot drops. <em>Skyrim </em>is also a relatively large game, so while one can assume Obsidian might've had plans for similar mechanics in <em>Avowed</em>, it's not out of the question that this would've led to feature creep and ultimately omitted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-garrus-companion-kai.jpg?itok=9G6sc6WJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-garrus-companion-kai.jpg?itok=ZGJa1dkm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's somewhat appropriate that the companion that shares the same voice actor as Garrus from <em>Mass Effect</em> should have the two most aesthetically unique weapons in <em>Avowed.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The more modern approach can best be described as horizontal upgrades. This method generally has the same tier system as linear upgrades, but instead of culminating in a couple of sets of super powerful armor, it usually expands into a more diverse array of armor sets that augment certain play styles via unique effects.</p>

<p>Some games take this one step further by letting you change the appearance of your armor, adding yet another potential avenue for player retention. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is an example of how modern games should approach gear progression</a>, featuring both a transmog system and multiple armor sets that have their own bonuses, giving you the chance to dress for fashion and function alike without compromise.</p>

<p>Horizontal gear mechanics are not without their own downsides. As far as players are concerned, this typically means more complexity, which is a non-issue if the game is built around having endgame content. For a linear story-driven experience like <em>Avowed</em>, this might be beyond what the developers intend for the game, especially if the target audience is leaning towards the casual end of the spectrum.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed's</em> Unique Approach to Leveling and Player Progression</h2>

<p>To their credit, Obsidian clearly recognized what people tend to like about loot and gear progression. All the individual parts are there in <em>Avowed</em>, at least on paper. There's a transmog mechanic to change the appearance of your armor, you can find a decent number of unique items with unique effects, and there's decent weapon variety.</p>

<p>The issue is that it felt like Obsidian was trying to reinvent the wheel while awkwardly avoiding referencing what everyone likes about the wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-mage-skills.jpg?itok=fE5tRzNm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-mage-skills.jpg?itok=GFBeJXiF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grimoires automatically upgrading your spells on casting is super cool and lets you play as a mage with minimal skill point investment.</figcaption></figure><p>Take <em>Avowed's</em> transmog system for instance. In theory, it should be a simple process of selecting a piece of armor and then pressing a button to change its appearance to another set of armor that you've discovered. Yet for some reason, you have to keep both sets of armor in your inventory for this to work.</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Avowed </em>has a decidedly linear method gear progression. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, except for the fact that there's only four quality tiers for normal weapons which means that there's very little visual variety. Yes, your superb sword + 3 is going to look way cooler than your common sword, nevermind that you're aesthetically limited to three European-style straight swords and a cutlass.</p>

<p>However, linear gear progression starts to present a practical problem if the game's damage scaling is tied to the player's gear quality. As far as can be told, all of <em>Avowed's</em> damage calculations ignore the player's level. Instead, incoming and outgoing damage is calculated purely based on the quality tier of your weapon and armor relative to the tier of the enemy.</p>

<p>If an enemy is a significantly higher tier, represented by the color of the health bar and any skulls next to their name, then they're going to take noticeably less damage. Similarly, if your armor is not a high enough tier, then you're going to get one-shot by everything on higher difficulties. Believe it or not, the the system was even more strict until <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220?emclan=103582791473758406&amp;emgid=689716592460694171" rel="nofollow">Obsidian toned it down in an early patch</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps Obsidian realized that everyone will eventually level up to a minimum level, but not everyone will constantly keep their gear upgraded. Alternatively, early feedback might've rightfully indicated that most people didn't expect to lose a significant amount of damage and damage resistance simply by following the main quest and encountering their first higher tier enemies in the second playable area.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed's</em> Unique Problems with Unique Loot</h2>

<p>Predictably, such a punishing damage model has cascading consequences. Players who are going in blind are likely going to be discouraged from switching weapons mid-playthrough because the damage loss might be too undesirable. The material cost would certainly hurt too as <em>Avowed </em>isn't exactly showering you in resources.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-unique-amulet.jpg?itok=r59geLd8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-unique-amulet.jpg?itok=pigaDeTE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This unique amulet is going to be S-tier when you fight a boss made entirely out of physical traps, or if you're Lara Croft.</figcaption></figure><p>You would think that this would encourage people to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/avowed-unique-item-locations" rel="nofollow">find unique gear and stick with it</a> to the end of the game, and you'd be right. The caveat is that a good number of <em>Avowed's</em> uniques have decidedly unspectacular effects. Annoyingly, there's no gear set bonuses either even though there's clearly gear sets.</p>

<p>This is especially noticeable in the first half of the story. No one's saying that you have to give new players the best armor in the game after their first kill, but surely Obsidian can do better than unique rings that slowly heal you when you're wet in a game where 99% of the time is spent on dry land. Other curious effects include boosts to parkour speed, health regen when walking, and the fact that <em>Avowed's</em> unique grimoires don't have any unique effect at all.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, you can find an accessory that provides a 5% crit chance boost halfway through the game and that alone is more impressive than any other accessory that you could've looted thus far. <em>Avowed's</em> unique weapons are slightly better, though they mostly just provide a 10% bonus of a specific elemental damage type.</p>

<p>With how tame some of these unique effects are, you'd almost think that they were designed with PvP balancing in mind. Or worse, that they were designed in a vacuum since few (if any) unique effects directly interact with your skills outside of effects that activate on parry. &nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-unique-greatsword.jpg?itok=FA0KK5Kl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-unique-greatsword.jpg?itok=cVVZDQYB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The practicality of this unique enchantment really depends on what difficulty you're playing on.</figcaption></figure><p>The obvious fix would've been through set bonuses. Take the aforementioned ring that only heals you when you're wet. Functionally useless on its own, but what if it was part of a set that when worn together grants you a chance to make everyone around you wet when dodging? Suddenly you have a more consistent health regen effect that makes it easier to freeze nearby enemies with the right spells.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed's</em> Future Lies with its Uniques</h2>

<p>That Obsidian didn't go in such a direction with <em>Avowed's</em> gear progression is certainly an odd choice. If anything, <em>Avowed's</em> loot system looks increasingly peculiar the more you look at it. For a developer as experienced as Obsidian is, surely they would have realized that games have been trending towards horizontal upgrade paths for a while and adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>There's no shortage of other games to draw inspiration from. The <em>Persona </em>series essentially lets you make custom endgame gear. The <em>Borderlands </em>games have a million examples of how unique gear doesn't need ridiculous stats to be relevant and memorable. From <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em> to <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you can even find players who will hunt down weapons and armor purely for the aesthetics.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, that's not to say that <em>Avowed </em>is a bad RPG. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" rel="nofollow">On the contrary, the RPG aspect of the game is above average at worst.</a> The major hangup is in the loot and gear progression mechanics, which feel oddly basic. Good loot is the spice that keeps combat interesting, yet it seems Obsidian has only got vanilla in their kitchen.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s ‘Project U’, which was in development at Ubisoft Annecy has had its intro cinematic leaked online.</p>



<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that the game was put back into incubation following five years of development.</p>



<p>The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube by known leaker Shaun Weber shows off the games intro cinematic, which sets the tone for the game. You can watch the intro below (expected to soon be DMCA’d)</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="That One Ubi Game 🤫Anime IntroSequence" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LqoaT1n5vr4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Project U, which was internally called ‘Pathfinder’ was set to be a new take on PvPvE, officially being announced in September 2022 as a “new kind of session-based cooperative shooter.”</p>



<p>According to sources, the game faced constant pushbacks and delays due to the games replayability, which also saw the games budget explode in size. Five years on, the game still wasn’t up to par, and Ubisoft pulled the plug on the project.</p>



<p>However, instead of cancellation the game entirely, it’s understood that the game went back to an internal incubation team because of Ubisoft’s belief that PvE games could still be successful. The team cited Helldivers 2 as being a particularly successful PvE game that could work well in today’s climate.</p>



<p>As for what Project U will turn into or if it will eventually be cancelled remains to be seen, regardless, it is nice to see (in my opinion at least), a little bit of the project made public.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Project U cinematic? Does it interest you in the game? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It is easily the best <em>RoboCop </em>game ever made. And we don’t have to wait long for the new installment, as <em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em> - <em>Unfinished Business</em> is set to arrive later this year. Oh, and if you haven’t played the first game, it’s on sale right now on Steam.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196215" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="68" data-playlist="196215,195670,196470" data-current="196215"><div><p>The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21757.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568">2023's <em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em></a></span> is a fantastic, semi-open world action-shooter with stellar combat and a shocking amount of heart. You can feel the devs really cared about <em>RoboCop</em> and his world when crafting the FPS, which includes RPG elements and multiple endings. And now, less than two years later, the same team behind <em>Rogue City</em> are ready to release a standalone follow-up, and I’m very excited. </p><p>On March 6, publisher Nacon announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished</em></a></span> <em>Business</em>, which the developers describe as a “new standalone adventure” set after the events of <em>Rogue City.</em> It’s arriving later this year on consoles and PC. And once again, players will hop into the metal boots of RoboCop as he takes on crime, corruption, robots, and a lot of dudes with guns. </p><p>This time around, RoboCop is sent into OmniTower, a massive apartment complex designed to help the most needy in Old Detroit. However, a group of mercs armed with “cutting-edge weapons” has taken over the entire building and turned it into a fortress. Robo has to kick ass and clear the place out. </p><p>Thankfully, RoboCop has some new weapons, including an ice cannon that can literally “freeze” enemies, and will also have access to new finishing moves involving different parts of the environment. </p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing addition to <em>Unfinished Business</em> are a series of missions where players will take on the role of Alex Murphy before he became RoboCop. The devs promise these missions will tie into the larger storyline of the sequel, while also revealing a new side of the famous police officer. But you’ll have to be careful as during these missions you are just a regular dude with neither superpowers nor a robot body. I’m very intrigued to see how these missions play, as they could be a great way to shake up the experience.</p><p>If you haven’t played <em>RoboCop: Rogue City </em>yet, well, now is a great time to check it out. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The original game is currently on sale on Steam for just $10 which is a steal.</a></span></p><p>As for the recently announced follow up, it doesn’t have a specific release date yet. Instead, Nacon says to expect<em> RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC sometime in Q3 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There have been many attempts to reboot the RTS recently, ranging from throwbacks like the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/age-of-mythology-retold">Age Of Mythology: Retold</a> to splicey novelties such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-aces">Battle Aces</a>. I’m not sure any have managed it, but I’m always glad to see fresh blood spilled in the house of Westwood. Which brings us to Project Citadel, a new space-me-do from Last Keep, a studio founded by former staff of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a> devs BonusXP and Age Of Empires outfit Ensemble. It pitches you against an alien empire, and blends squad mechanics redolent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-wars">Halo Wars</a> with a roguelike format that aims to support shorter play sessions, while still supposedly allowing for vintage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> gambits like booming and rushing.

You don't know what "booming" is? Goodness, you sound just like me before I wrote this news post: turns out it's something I've been doing for years without realising. For clarity, “booming” is when you focus on building up your economy at the start of a traditional RTS match. “Rushing” is obviously when you commit to an early offensive with cheapo units. Project Citadel aims to make these approaches work across a procedurally generated, turn-based campaign, with players moving across a branching, galactic overmap of smaller RTS encounters. The construction element is supplied by your mothership, which can assemble starbases and also provide support in battle.
</p>
<p>
The missing third pillar here is “turtling”, which is when you throw up as many defences as possible to begin with, hoping that your opponent will rush you and splatter themselves all over your turrets (a boomer player, by contrast, will simply gain a headstart in production while you’re wasting time prepping for an attack that never comes). Project Citadel doesn’t do turtling, it seems, because you’re always on the assault, forever trying to bring down that dang Voltari empire.
</p>
<p>
For ex-Microsoft and Battlefy exec Yohan Sengamalay and his collaborators, who include former Ensemble devs David Pottinger and Jason Sallenbach, bringing in roguelike elements is all about "deconstructing” the strategy genre. "We've taken the traditional, lengthy campaign and broken it into shorter missions that fit a roguelike structure,” Sengamalay told me over email. “This maintains meaningful choices and depth while introducing quicker rewards and greater experimentation.” 
</p>
<p>
As for unit control, “the moment-to-moment combat retains some similarity with strategy games we've worked on, but with added combat movement and skill-shot abilities to emphasize timing,” Sengamalay went on. “You command squadrons rather than individual units, an expansion of what we started with Halo Wars, allowing us to make the game equally playable on both controllers and mouse/keyboard setups.” The ships themselves range from missile-vomming daggers to hard-wearing behemoths. Their “skill-shots” include ramming through opposing formations like a herd of buffalo.
</p>
<p>
As for how Project Citadel stands apart from other attempts to jump-start a new era in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> &amp; Conquering, Sengamalay observed to me that “while the genre is experiencing a resurgence, it is very much centered around remakes or spiritual successors”. Last Keep are a titchy indie, numbering just 2-10 people according to their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/last-keep/about/">LinkedIn</a>. According to Sengamalay, they're “neither interested nor have the resources to simply re-make past successes like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/age-of-empires">Age of Empires</a>”.
</p>
<p>
The pessimistic take on all this is that people have been cobbling roguelike exoskeletons onto other species of game for decades – I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-light-deck-builder-is-not-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-its-a-cry-for-help">moaned about the abundance of roguelike deckbuilders</a> on these very pages not two weeks ago. Sometimes, the combination is a symbiosis, and sometimes it’s parasitism: the repetitiveness of rogueliking overpowers other aspects of the experience.</p>
<p>The cynical read is that I've heard a pitch like this before. While at BonusXP - which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studio-behind-stranger-things-game-and-more-shutting-down/1100-6514774/">closed in June 2023 for reasons not given at the time</a>, amid widespread games industry cuts - Pottinger and Sallenbach worked on Servo, an RTS that sought similarly to spice things up with RPG elements, and was also touted as being from former Age Of Empires developers. Released in early access in 2015, it won praise initially but never made it to 1.0.</p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, I'm always interested in attempts to "deconstruct" an established format. As an elder Age Of Mythology player who carries a candle for Halo Wars, I hope that Project Citadel fares better than Servo. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2929040/Project_Citadel/">You can read more about the game on Steam</a>. There’s no release date yet.
