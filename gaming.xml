It’s never been ported to PC (officially, at least) or even PS5, and it doesn’t sound like a remaster, remake, or sequel is anywhere in the current pipeline at FromSoftware. At least projects like <em>Bloodborne Top Down Arena </em>are continuing to keep the hype alive in the meantime. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-video-games-to-play-with-family-at-christmas/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Holidays are just around the corner, and with Christmas cheer comes family gaming time. Everyone loves to sit around an open fire and play video games with the family, but which games are best to play this Christmas?</p>



<p>Here are the top five best games to play with family at Christmas.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-video-games-to-play-with-family-at-christmas">Top Video Games to Play with Family at Christmas</h2>



<p>Do not get this list confused with the best Christmas games to play. This list solely is made up of the best multiplayer games to play with your family this Christmas.</p>



<p>While so many titles are out there waiting to be explored, there are a specific few that really hit the mark when looking for a family-fun game to play this Holiday season.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-all-lego-games">5. All LEGO Games</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are many different LEGO games out there, making it incredibly difficult to choose just one. However, all LEGO video games have a co-op mode, meaning you can explore the plot with another player.</p>



<p>And guess what? They are all family-friendly too! LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Batman and more all fit the bill as being some of the best games to play with family at Christmas. Whether you are looking for a galactic adventure or something else to sit down with your kids and play, any LEGO game should suffice.</p>



<p>LEGO games are also available on all consoles, including PlayStations, Xboxes and Nintendo Switches.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-4-minecraft">4. Minecraft</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another great game for the family to explore together is Minecraft. Not only is this game cheap, but it allows parents and kids to sit down and build entire worlds together. Explore your creativity with this game, building different landscapes the ways you want them.</p>



<p>Minecraft has been around for over a decade now, and still stands as one of the best multiplayer games out there, whether it is with friends or family.</p>



<p>This Christmas, though, anyone with a PC, Switch, Xbox or PS5 will be able to sit down and play this popular game together, making it the perfect video game for the Holidays.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-3-super-smash-bros-ultimate">3. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Need a game with a bit more action? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate takes all the famous Nintendo characters, allowing players to fight each other with them. Smash Bros has been around since the N64, being one of the most popular competitive games out there. The game is a Nintendo exclusive, though, so will only work on the Switch.</p>



<p>Still, this game is great for anyone, as you do not need too much knowledge to actually enjoy the fighting process. With maps resembling your favorite Nintendo character’s world, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will have any gamer excited.</p>



<p>While the game includes fighting, it is still toon-animated, meaning there is absolutely no blood or gore.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-2-mario-kart">2. Mario Kart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Can’t have a list of games to play at Christmas with the family without including Mario Kart. With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the current Nintendo racing game on the Switch, families can jump in a vehicle and race each other just like back in the ’90s when the N64’s version was released.</p>



<p>The game even has a plethora of classic maps too for those who have not played the game in years to explore. Mario Kart has always amped up the action in every title Nintendo has released, making it one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world.</p>



<p>Mario Kart is perfect for anyone looking for a fun game to play with family during Christmas.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-1-mario-party">1. Mario Party</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>With the Nintendo Switch having a few versions of Mario Party for families to play, it is easily the best game to play with your loved ones this Christmas. With mini-games and more, this game is accessible to just about anyone, making it well worth the purchase if you do not have it yet.</p>



<p>With classic maps and new ones, Mario Party is basically a board game using classic Mario characters and more. At the end of each round, players compete against one another in different mini-games. Mario Party is just as much fun as it is competitive, making it the best game for families to play together at Christmas.</p>



<p>What game will you be playing this Christmas with your family?</p>

Those include “social hangouts,” where the primary purpose is to communicate with others over text or voice chat, and “free-form 2D user creation” experiences, where players can do things like draw on a chalkboard or whiteboard. This change goes into effect beginning November 18th.</p><p>Another change stops kids under 13 from playing, searching for, or being able to discover unrated experiences. This change goes into effect after December 3rd. If a creator wants to let a player under 13 access their game, they will have to complete a questionnaire and make sure that all of the information regarding their experience meets Roblox’s requirements for its current All Ages or 9 plus ratings. Roblox says it will start enforcing those requirements “next year.”</p><p>There have been multiple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">recent stories</a> about Roblox’ allegedly poor protections for children, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">a <em>Bloomberg</em> article</a> titled “Roblox’s Pedophile Problem.” In October, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">changes for pre-teen users</a> and a new type of account to let parents manage their kids on Roblox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But we’re not gonna delve into anything that actually happens in the game here. So don’t worry about that. But there are pages of concept art for hypothetical party members that didn’t end up in <em>The Veilguard</em>. Some of them would have been new characters that don’t have names, such as a qunari mage dressed in chains and tattoo-covered Antivan Crow. But there is one character in the book who would have been a returning character from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. However, she wasn’t an ally. In fact, you could kill her in your playthrough depending on your choices. This was magister Calpernia, who once led the Venatori mages against the player in one of <em>Inquisition</em>’s routes.</p><p>According to the art book, Calpernia was a potential party member at some point in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s development. She’s shown in the concept art in some regal armor, notably with a prosthetic leg. Neve, one of the party members who made it into the game, is a mage with a prosthetic leg, so it seems like some of those concepts may have been adapted for that character.</p><p>Logistically, it makes sense that BioWare would scrap this idea because Calpernia exists in so many different quantum states depending on player choice. But that hasn’t stopped fans from being upset about an underrated fan-favorite villain not making it into <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>Personally, I have little attachment to Calpernia because I never encountered her in my <em>Inquisition</em> playthrough. The only way to get her to show up is by recruiting the templars in the game’s first act, and I’m a career mage who was trying to smooch Dorian. So Calpernia and I never crossed paths. But it’s always fun to know who might’ve joined the party sometime down the line. I mean, unless it upsets you to know this information. But Calpernia could still show up in a future <em>Dragon Age </em>game, assuming BioWare allows players to import choices on what happened to her.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And according to Benson, at least one fan directly confronted her about the role back in 2017. </p><p>“Seven years ago, at various conventions where we meet and greet with wonderful fans, somebody slipped one of these wonderful games to my table,” explained Benson. “And I said, ‘Why are you bringing me that?’ and he [said] ‘Because you’re in it’ and I said ‘Do you know?

<p>Dota 2 is arguably the biggest esports in the world. With The International giving out millions of dollars every year, we have seen many new Dota players emerge into the scene. Dreaming of being one of those players? Well, you better start off playing ranked. </p>



<p>Here is a list of all the Dota 2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks">All Dota 2 Ranks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald</strong></li>



<li><strong>Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crusader</strong></li>



<li><strong>Archon</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legend</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ancient</strong></li>



<li><strong>Divine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Immortal</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-dota-2-matchmaking-rating-mmr-explained">How to Rank Up in Dota 2 | Matchmaking Rating (MMR) Explained</h2>



<p>Hitting the rank of Immortal in Dota 2 is incredibly difficult for any competitor, even the best. The game’s ranking system follows a Matchmaking Rating (MMR) system, which grants players MMR as they progress through the ranks. </p>



<p>To rank up, players will have to participate in ranked matches, winning games and more. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks-and-their-mmr">All Dota 2 Ranks and Their MMR:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald:</strong> 1 – 769 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Guardian: </strong>770- 1539 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Crusader:</strong> 1540 – 2309 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Archon:</strong> 2310 – 3079 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Legend:</strong> 3080 – 3849 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Ancient:</strong> 3850 – 4619 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Divine:</strong> 4620 – 5620 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Immortal:</strong> 5620+ MMR.</li>
</ul>



<p>When first beginning to play ranked, new accounts will have their MMR calculated after playing a series of matches. They will then be put into rank and awarded their first medal. </p>



<p>No one, however, will start in Immortal. With each loss, you will lose MMR, potentially dropping in rank. However, those playing core roles in matches (carry, mid-lane) will receive more MMR per win than those playing support roles (off-lane, soft support, hard support).</p>



<p>All Ranks, excluding Immortal, are split up into five parts. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked">What is ranked?</h2>



<p>Ranked play is a special competitive mode in Dota 2 (and many other games) where players compete against one another, climbing a specialized ranked system. While the actual ranked system does not reward players outside of in-game rewards and bragging rights, many pro players still make sure to flex their high ranks amongst others.</p>



<p>With Dota 2 having such a large skill gap, it can be incredibly difficult and daunting for new players to attempt an Immortal run, but it is still entirely possible.</p>



<p>Will you be attempting to hit the Immortal rank in Dota 2?</p>

<p>By now, we’ve all heard or witnessed the atrocity that they’re calling the Borderlands movie. It receives staggeringly low reviews from critics and viewers alike, with low single-digit ratings for the most part. But apparently, it wasn’t all bad. According to Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the live-action film didn’t hurt the video game franchise, but it actually helped significantly.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-was-disappointing-but-didnt-hurt-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously that movie was disappointing. That said, it actually sold more catalog. So, I don’t think it hurt at all, if anything I think it may have helped a little bit. It does highlight something that I’ve spoken about many times which is the difficulty of bringing our intellectual property to another medium.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, by “catalog,” Zelnick refers to the collection of video games within the franchise, such as Borderlands 2, Tales From the Borderlands, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Essentially, the hype surrounding the film and people actually viewing it in theaters caused a significant rise in video game sales. People saw the movie, wanted more of the genuine article, and went to play the video games instead of re-watching the bomb film a second time. </p>



<p>If you saw the film and were one of the many who decided the video games were more your style, welcome! You should start by playing Borderlands 2, as it’s universally considered one of the best titles in the franchise. I didn’t mind the gameplay in Borderlands 3, but the writing and dialogue left me cringing more frequently than I’d typically like.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive held its earnings call for Q2 2025 on Wednesday, and with it came an update on the development of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9aa55113-4f45-4264-8ff6-822353eddcd8">press release</a> for the earnings, it was said, once again, that the game will release in fall 2025. </p>







<p>The small update, which many won’t view as much of an update at all, continues the regular messaging from the company on the state of GTA 6. Over the last few months, Take-Two has continued to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-reaffirms-fall-2025-release-date-for-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirm people</a> that GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release date. </p>



<p>As far as when a new trailer could be revealed, more details on the game’s features, or a more concrete release date announcement, the release didn’t mention that. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick didn’t provide any additional comment or context regarding the game’s release date or announcement plans during the actual call.</p>



<p>The first reveal of GTA 6 came <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-releases-gta-6-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly a year ago</a> when the first trailer was released. Since then, however, there’s been no update for a game that’s said to be a year away.</p>



<p>Do you still think GTA 6 will release in 2025? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Following the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games, Take-Two also revealed they sold off indie game publisher Private Division, but didn’t specify the buyer. Along with the sale of the company itself, Take-Two also sold off the publisher’s entire catalog of live and unreleased titles. However, they stated they would continue supporting No Rest for the Wicked, the recent Private Division-published action RPG from developer Moon Studios.</p>



<p>The publisher’s sale comes as part of the Take-Two earnings results, in which they said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supposedly, while the buyer remains unknown, a private equity firm did show interest in Private Division beforehand.</p>



<p>Private Division, as a publishing company, was behind multiple hit releases and upcoming games we had on our radar, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kerbal Space Program 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>OlliOlliWorld</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hades</strong></li>
</ul>

            <p>
Sega's legendary <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> series is set to make a return, the publisher has confirmed, some 18 years after the launch of its most recent numbered instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, there've been numerous updated releases of Virtua Fighter 5 (culminating with 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, itself a remaster of the earlier Final Showdow), alongside mobile instalments, and even a arcade update for Virtual Fighter 3. What series fans <em>haven't</em> had, though, is a brand-new game.
</p>
<p>
But now, Sega's new global head of transmedia, Justin Scarpone, has offered some hope in an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/">interview with VGC</a>. "So we have a suite of titles in development right now that fall into that legacy bucket," he explained, "which we announced last year at The Game Awards; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>, Streets of Rage, Shinobi."

<p>
Then came the bombshell. "And we have another Virtua Fighter being developed," Scrapone added, before glossing over the revelation completely, "And then in certain instances, we're also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps." It's not, then, confirmation a new mainline Virtua Fighter instalment is on the way <em>exactly</em>, but it's something to chew on at least.
</p><p>
Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">announcing a flurry of legacy game revivals</a> last year - including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Golden Axe, "and more" - details remain limited. Sega has shared a little about its Crazy Taxi update - calling it an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer">open-world, massively-multiplayer game</a> that's "AAA" in scope - but it's yet to talk launch windows, other than saying it'll "release these projects in the coming years."

The world's largest digital TTRPG distribution has implemented a new browsing option, allowing consumers to search for games and supplements made by human hands.</p>

<h2>The DrivethruRPG AI-Content Filter Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an update on <a href="https://help.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/26794784634007-Customer-Experience-with-AI-Generated-Content-Within-Titles#h_01J97G88WDYDR5K4EXEH739R99" rel="nofollow">their official website</a>, the DrivethruRPG AI-Content filter lets users toggle how much content made by generative AI they see on the platform.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drivethrurpg-ai-content-filter-screenshot.jpg?itok=oPGuF4nO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drivethrurpg-ai-content-filter-screenshot.jpg?itok=A0JdXQD9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a User Account Settings under Additional Preferences, users can choose one of three options under "Creation Method." Handcrafted is for those who want games made by flesh and blood human beings. The worldbuilding, the text, the mechanics, and the artwork; all human-made.</p>

<p>Conversely, the Contains AI-Generated Content option is for those who are fine with products containing material made from generative AI programs. The product in question cannot be entirely AI-generated due to an official content policy by the platform. The third option, Creation Method Not Chosen, is the default.</p>

<p>If you are using the more recent version of DrivethruRPG, the AI-content filter is a simple on/off toggle alongside adult content.</p>

This is due to its current use across multiple tech companies <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem">actively stealing</a> work from users to train their programs.</p>

<p>This practice has also led to widespread energy usage and resource drainage. This is exemplified by Microsoft negotiating a deal to r<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120581/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-microsoft-ai">eopen Three Mile Island</a> in the US as a power source for their own cloud and AI power usage.</p>

<p>It is a subject that hasn't just lead to greater scrutiny of material used in large productions, and it has lead to several publishers and creatives to take stances on their use.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Valiant</em> designer and publisher Kobold Press <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank">is proudly anti-AI</a>. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vocalized support</a> of the use of AI in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, which lead to their communications director, Greg Tito, leaving the company. And recently the streaming service platform Netflix has announced they are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going all in</a> on generative AI for their gaming division.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/foxhole">Foxhole</a> is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don't play it. It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.
</p>
<p>Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

<p>Dropping bombs on the world below? I get it. Delivering paratroopers behind enemy lines? I love it. I'm less clear on how air-to-air combat works. There's a shot in the trailer of two nimble fighter planes diving and shooting down some bombers operating at a lower height, but I'm struggling to work out how that actually functions as a player action.
</p><p>Otherwise air combat plugs into Foxhole's vast battlefield is obvious ways. It expands the logistical side of the game, as players will need to work to support aircraft production and supply, and "every pilot is a player", as the trailer says, with players also able to play a gunner role onboard. 
</p>
<p>Foxhole Airborne follows on from Foxhole: Naval Warfare, which added ship-to-ship combat and beach landings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/foxholes-massive-naval-warfare-update-is-out-now-adding-gunboats-and-subs-to-its-persistent-battlefield">in October last year</a>. It means that the game will now feature land, sea and air combat all on the same persistent battlefield.
</p>
<p>Lest foot soldiers feel they're being neglected, an infantry update will arrive later this month on November 18th. It aims to revamp combat, with new anti-tank weaponry, close quarters combat, medic changes, and a stamina and suppression overhaul, among others. It sounds like a robust set of changes. You'll find screenshots of that, and of more planes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505460/view/4438953498491486592">in a developer news post over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I need to entertain the notion that I have some power. I need to remember that fascism is a loser ideology and that it can be dismantled, and I will gain all of this by replaying Bethesda and MachineGames’ <em>Wolfenstein </em>games and literally tearing men-turned-monsters to pieces. <strong>If I can’t have the real thing, I want to virtually preside over the rotting husk of fascism in </strong><em><strong>Wolfenstein</strong></em><strong>, which is widely available on platforms but is specifically on PlayStation Plus’s Games Catalog (at the Extra tier or higher), Xbox Game Pass, and, by extension, PC Game Pass.</strong></p><p>In case you don’t know, <em>Wolfenstein </em>is a series of first-person shooters following B.J. Blazkowicz, an American soldier who effectively goes missing during World War II. In <em>Wolfenstein</em>’s version of history, the Allied Powers lose the war and the Nazis conquer the world. Their ineptitude and hate creeps into every facet of life as far as the eye can see. Though the first game in this rebooted series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-makes-wolfenstein-the-new-order-so-great-1797195901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-makes-wolfenstein-the-new-order-so-great-1797195901"><em>The New Order</em></a></span>, largely takes place on the European front, the sequel shifts focus to America and beyond and interrogates how such an ideology could fit a country that once swore to combat it.</p><p>Nazis have been the de facto villains of a lot of stories both inside and outside of games, but the <em>Wolfenstein </em>reboots were the first games I played to take them deathly seriously. Perhaps <em>The New Order </em>was just a little ahead of the curve, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1819979622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1819979622"><em>The New Colossus</em></a></span><em> </em>landed in 2017—mere months after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville—and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-six-months-later-1825582710&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-six-months-later-1825582710">met the moment head-on</a></span>, depicting fascism in our country as though it were baked into our very being. Who am I to argue with that assessment now?<br></p><p>Besides its lofty interrogations of Nazism though, the <em>Wolfenstein </em>series is also well known for its gritty gameplay. Like its earliest incarnations, these shooters did <em>not </em>feature regenerating health, instead offering armor and health as pickups to be found around the map or in combat. Much like the <em>DOOM </em>reboot of 2016, this inspired players to push forward and be aggressive in order to survive, a tactic that sounds all too good right now. <em>Wolfenstein </em>forces you to be scrappy, and the skirmishes that arise from the tension of scrambling under such duress are among some of the genre’s best.<br></p><p>I’ve always described <em>Wolfenstein</em>’s action and gunplay as punchy. Its guns have a tremendous kick to them. They communicate an overwhelming, almost frightening amount of power, which makes it oh-so-good to point said weapons at literal Nazis. Over the course of the games, B.J.’s armory expands, but he also becomes a proper Nazi deterrent. Through means that I won’t entirely spoil, the man essentially becomes a hulking tank capable of smashing, slashing, and otherwise ripping fascists to shreds. Describing it now, I’m almost giddy to jump back into the games in the days to come.</p><p>I don’t know, y’all. That’s all I’ve got for you right now. I’m a ball of pure seething anger, and I can only really safely project that into a false reality by playing <em>Wolfenstein </em>at the moment. Otherwise, I’m feeling as defeated as many of you. The rest of my life was just decided for me overnight, and I could do little to stop it. Things are going to happen, exceptionally bad things, and I’ll be helpless to stop most of it. But I can shoot some Nazis in <em>Wolfenstein</em>, rally, and get back to the real fight as soon as I can. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After 11 years, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 continues to do well with players. Not only is it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-stream-most-popular-in-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular game on stream</a>, but GTA 5’s sales continue to reach milestones.</p>



<p>During its <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 6, Take-Two Interactive announced that GTA 5 sales have passed 205 million copies in its 11-year lifespan. That total is up by five million from the 200 million copies announced during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings.</p>







<p>As a whole, the GTA franchise has sold over 435 million copies.</p>



<p>In addition to the sales success of GTA 5 and elsewhere, Take-Two praised GTA Online, which continued to be a major point for the company despite its age. According to the company, GTA Online continues to be one of the “largest contributors” to their net bookings despite expectations of a decline.</p>

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that GTA Online has continued to “outperform expectations” thanks to updates and “sustained engagement”.</p>

And there's one card that everyone seems to agree they hate, whether they're using it or facing an opponent with it: Misty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Misty is a Supporter card, essentially a type of card that can be played once per turn to give yourself an advantageous effect. Misty is explicitly designed for use in decks featuring water-type Pokemon, and comes with the following effect: "Choose one of your water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until you get tails. For each hads, take a water-type Energy from your Energy Zone and attach it to that Pokemon." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon need energy to use attacks on opponents, but typically you can only attach one energy to one Pokemon per turn. So the idea behind Misty is to quickly power up a single water-type Pokemon so it can use an Energy-intensive attack right away, rather than having to wait two, three, four, or more turns to blast away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Misty's efficacy depends entirely on coin flips, meaning she can either be completely useless (if you flip tails right away) or so overpowered as to be ridiculous (if you flip more heads than you need). So of course, people who are using Misty in their decks are complaining about constantly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fu4o9f/misty_card/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flipping tails </a>right away, and people who are facing Misty are posting...well, this:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/screenshot-2024-11-06-130544-1730919966599.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/Money_Tap2401 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustrations with Misty's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gc6uyu/misty_is_a_lie/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luck-heavy</a> potential are resulting in a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw52i6/is_misty_badly_designed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions</a> as to whether or not the card design needs to be changed.

The biggest issue players are citing apart from her luck-heavy mechanic is that if a Misty-user gets luck and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi9jex/how_are_you_supposed_to_come_back_against_a_turn/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draws her turn one</a>, they can then use her to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw3zl8/misty_lets_you_attack_t1_and_its_bs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially attack their opponent on turn one</a>. Typically, players are not able to attack on the first turn due to the game prohibiting attaching an energy on turn one, a fairness mechanic intended to ensure going second isn't a massive disadvantage.

        <p>Our review will splash down next week</p>

            <p>We'll have a review of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> soon, but I keep making Brendy do other tasks so he's not had enough time yet to ride the rails. That means it falls to me to at least let you know that Frontier's theme park builder is out now.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The sequel's big new feature is the ability to fill your theme park with water, crafting pools and slides alongside your more traditional rides, or combining the two Splash Mountain-style.
</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 was announced back in July and Brendy had a chance to play it at preview in September, where he found it mostly offered the same creative charms as the first in the series:
</p>
<blockquote>Much of what made up the first game returns. The focus is still on creating your own rides and attractions from scratch, rather than relying on pre-made roller coasters and water flumes (though those will still exist for those who prefer to pre-plop). That encouragement to piece things together even goes for the snack kiosks and changing rooms, which can be embedded in the shells of other buildings, like clicking together modular toy models.</blockquote>
<p>The original Planet Coaster led creative and patient souls to craft some truly wild rides, but its reputation as a management game was less positive. I'm curious if Planet Coaster 2 can make the game more appealing to me, someone who can't be bothered to craft an original and physically feasible rollercoaster from scratch, but who does enjoy designing a capitalist hellscape which siphons the money-marrow from customer's wallets. Hopefully Brendy will answer that question next week.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Steam user reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">aren't looking too hot</a>, but you can pick up the game for £40/€50/$50 if you're already convinced.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-tactics-the-surprising-genre-twist-of-the-classic-run-and-gunner-is-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I would never have predicted there'd be an isometric tactics game based on run-and-gun series Metal Slug, yet here <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> is, and I am here for it. We've been following its development for a while but it's out now on Steam, and seemingly as strong as its demo suggested.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Metal Slug Tactics is a tactical RPG, to be specific, as well as a roguelite. You fight your way through squads of enemies to unlock weapons and perks for your own soldiers, with those upgrades persisting across the campaign even if you fail and must repeat specific missions.
</p>
<p>Nic mostly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-tactics-demo-is-pure-nostalgia-for-better-and-worse">praised the demo during June's Steam Next Fest</a>, finding it had more tactical depth than the nostalgic copy-paste he was expecting:
</p>
<blockquote>Every turn each character gets one move and one action, but if you take the action first, you also lose your move. This feels on the more restrictive end as far as action economies go, but you can use "synchronisation" attacks to stretch that economy out, further than a pack of Subway meat over a thousand anemic dirt-loafs. These are special tag-team actions you trigger for free by setting up orthogonal flanking postions. For now, though, it’s just Marco. I can pick between a pistol and a machine gun, but the latter has limited ammo. It’s here I notice some nice quality-of-life bits. You can undo moves and fast forward enemy turns, though there is a restriction on the undo-ing, which I’ll unfurl below like a yellowing lettuce leaf on a stale roll that costs eighteen pounds, or sixteen pounds with ten years' worth of Subway loyalty points.</blockquote>
<p>Nic also took a lot of shots at Subway sandwiches in that article, for he does not acknowledge the glory of the Italian BMT.
</p>
<p>Metal Slug Tactics' demo no longer seems to be available - boo - but the game itself is currently £18.89/$22.49/€22.49 with a 10% launch discount <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The question is: Are you one of those potential people who will care about what the PS5 Pro offers? Let’s find out! I’m going to ask some questions, and we’ll figure out if you should buy a PS5 Pro. I’m here to help, so answer truthfully, and we’ll get through this together.</p><h2 id="h31862"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you have a 120hz 4K TV?</strong></h2><p>The PS5 technically supports 120 FPS video games, but in practice, most games can only manage 60 FPS on the base console. If that annoys you and you wish for more opportunities to play 120 FPS games, then the PS5 Pro will provide that. But you’ll need a 120hz TV to actually play games at 120 FPS. Likewise, the PS5 Pro—thanks to its AI upscaling tech known as PSSR—can run many games at 4K, leading to a sharper and cleaner image. But, again, if your TV is only 1080p, you won’t really get to enjoy that fancy upscaled 4K image.</p><p>I have a big, 4K 120hz TV with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), which ensures gameplay is often smooth because my TV adjusts to the game’s frame rate, and all the bells and whistles. I bought it a few years ago during a really good Black Friday sale. So I’m able to fully enjoy all the PS5 Pro’s features and improvements. If you don’t have a television like that, or if you aren’t even sure if it supports 4K or 120hz, then you probably don’t need a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h31863"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you care about ray tracing?</strong></h2><p>One of the big selling points of the PS5 Pro is the ability to play games at higher frame rates while not sacrificing all the visual features you get from 30 FPS fidelity modes. For many games, this means being able to play at 60 FPS while still having ray-traced reflections or lighting. This can make a game look more realistic and is better than screen space reflections, which tend to look messy and ugly, especially when viewed too closely. </p><p><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morale</em>s, for example, looks incredible at 60 FPS on PS5 Pro, with high-resolution reflections on skyscrapers helping it look almost photorealistic. <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s reflections also look amazing on Pro, though the game is capped at 30 FPS. If you don’t care about enhanced reflections and shiny surfaces looking more accurate, then a lot of the PS5 Pro’s more subtle improvements, like increased draw distances in some games, will likely not matter to you either. So you probably don’t need to go buy a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h31864"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you prefer fidelity modes over performance modes?</strong></h2><p>The moment I start a new game, the first thing I do is hop into the settings to see what I can tweak. Can I increase a game’s frame rate? Are there options to turn motion blur on or off? Is there a way to make it look nicer or run better? So, for me, a person obsessed with visuals and performance, the PS5 Pro has been a lot of fun. Most Pro-enhanced games offer multiple graphics options and performance tweaks, letting me enjoy games the way I want. </p><p>If you are someone who boots up a game and never checks the settings unless something breaks or annoys you, then the PS5 Pro might not be for you. The PS5 Pro is a console built for people who tinker with HDR settings, care about FOV, and flip between different performance options to see which they prefer. If that sounds annoying or tiring, then you likely aren’t the kind of person who would be happy spending $700+ on a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h31865"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you already own a PS5?</strong></h2><p>If you already own a PS5 or bought one recently, then an upgrade is likely not your priority. However, if you don’t already own a PS5 and are looking to hop into this current generation of games, you might wonder if the PS5 Pro is the best option. You might think it being the most powerful console on the market and the best version of the PS5 makes it the default device to buy. But, as I’ve laid out above, the PS5 Pro isn’t for everyone. </p><p>If you just want to enjoy PS5 exclusive games like <em>Spider-Man 2, Horizon: Forbidden West, Silent Hill 2, </em>and a litany of other titles (and don’t own a PC that can run those games), a standard PlayStation 5 will get the job done. Games still look great on the console, and most offer solid performance modes, too. The only reason you should even think about buying a PS5 Pro as your first PS5 console is if you own a high-end TV already and care about things like VRR, 4K output, and 120 FPS options. Otherwise, just buy a base PS5 this holiday season and enjoy it.</p><h2 id="h31866"><a id=""></a><strong>So, who is the PS5 Pro for?</strong></h2><p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is for a rather meticulous gamer. This gamer is someone who already owns a high-quality 4K/120hz TV or plans to buy one. They’re someone who has already invested heavily in the PlayStation ecosystem and has a collection of PS5 games they can enjoy on the PS5 Pro. They’re the type of person who cares about in-game settings and visual options, and who gets excited over the various graphical settings each game offers. You need to be the kind of person who can spot the difference between a game running at 30 FPS versus 60 or 120. You also need to care about higher resolutions and image quality. You should not only know what ray tracing is but be excited to enable it when you can. </p><p>In other words, you need to be something of an A/V enthusiast to truly enjoy the PS5 Pro.</p><p>I’ve enjoyed playing around with the one Sony sent me over the last week, as I’m the kind of person this $700 super-console was designed for. But I’m not convinced most people should buy a PS5 Pro. That’s not to say the Pro is worthless or a bad idea. </p><p>While some online have scoffed at the idea of a more powerful PS5, I think Sony’s plan makes sense. As confirmed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/X24BzyzQQ-8?t=174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/X24BzyzQQ-8?t=174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s own data</a></span>, players generally prefer performance modes over fidelity modes in most games. So building a console focused on letting players enjoy smooth frame rates without sacrificing fancy visuals or high resolutions is a sensible strategy.</p><p>The challenge Sony faces is that many people are satisfied with their base PS5 and the options it provides. And after spending a week with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/8x418kpa17lhq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/8x418kpa17lhq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 Pro</a></span>, I’m confident in saying it’s really for the detail-obsessed gamers willing to spend $700 to make already great-looking games look even better on their big 120hz TVs. That might not be you, and that’s okay because you aren’t missing out on anything you care about anyway.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Clay is an essential resource in Stardew Valley. While it isn’t used in the Community Center bundles or as gifts to the villagers, it is still used in construction and crafting. It is one of the most overlooked resources, as it isn’t prevalent like stone, wood, and fiber. Let us show you how to obtain clay quickly in your Stardew Valley playthrough!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-clay-in-stardew-valley">How to Get Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>Clay can be obtained in multiple ways. The tricky-to-find resource can be found by:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tilling dirt (on your farm, throughout Pelican Town, and within the mines)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling sand on the beach</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling Artifact spots</strong></li>



<li><strong>When opening Geodes at Clint’s shop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mining clay nodes at the Ginger Island Dig Site</strong></li>



<li><strong>As a gift from Jas, Vincent, or Leo during the Feast of the Winter Star</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vincent sells clay at the Desert Festival shop for a single Calico Egg</strong></li>



<li><strong>Your pet dog may gift you clay once it reaches maximum friendship</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While some of these methods are purely chance, like characters or pets gifting the resource to you, others take more work. For example, tilling dirt, sand, and artifact spots will take you time, and it’s not guaranteed you’ll find clay with every use of your hoe. Of course, tilling the land for clay becomes easier as you upgrade your hoe to higher qualities and can till multiple spaces simultaneously. Out of all the places to dig and till for clay, it is recommended to do so in the mines, as tilling the dirt there can also yield cave carrots, and bombs can be placed to help unearth things faster in the mines.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-you-need-clay-in-stardew-valley">Why You Need Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>As mentioned, clay isn’t used in any Community Center bundles and isn’t a liked gift. So why bother with it? Well, it’s vital for crafting and construction, of course! To build a silo, an essential building on your farm, if you intend to keep animals, you’ll need ten clay, 100 stone, five copper bars, and 100 gold.</p>



<p>In addition to the construction of a silo, clay is also needed to craft: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Retaining Soil</strong></li>



<li><strong>Garden Pots</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brick Floors</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fiber Seeds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deluxe Retaining Soil</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bone Mills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dehydrator</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Some of these items aren’t essential for a playthrough, but you’ll find they can make life on your farm much more manageable.</p>

            <p>
Well, here's another mystery to cross off the 'unresolved' list; 20 years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>'s release, Konami has finally confirmed fan suspicions that Russian spy Eva was voiced by the same actor who player Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.
</p>
<p>
The identity of Eva's voice performer has long puzzled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 fans, given the person listed in the game's credit - one Suzetta Miñet - didn't appear to be a real person at all. And while vocal similarities had led some community members to believe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/5ee3b2/jodi_benson_voice_of_ariel_from_disneys_the/">Miñet was actually a pseudonym for Ariel voice actor Jodi Benson</a> (although she was far from the only suspect), it's never been officially confirmed... until now.
</p>
<p>
In the newly released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDIWFh7nYa4">third instalment of Konami's Metal Gear Solid Legacy Series documentary</a>, charting the history of the franchise, Benson finally confirmed her Snake Eater involvement and shared a little more about how Suzetta Miñet came to be. "When we recorded... in 2003," she explained, "just the various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family based, children-based, things like that. So it was actually [our director] Kris Zimmerman Salter; she kind of sat down with me and she's like, maybe we need to change your name."

<p>
"So she asked me, 'What was your dog's name growing up?'," Benson continued, "and I said, 'Suzette Monet'. So she's like, 'You know what, let's build on that. How about Suzetta? How about instead of Monet, the artist, we'll do Miñet?', and I was like, 'Sounds like a deal!"
</p><p>
However, Benson - whose other roles include Barbie in the Toy Story series and Thumbelina - admits some fans still managed to suss her out, even with the pseudonym. "Seven years ago, at various conventions when we meet and greet with wonderful fans," she went on, "somebody slipped one of these wonderful games to my table, and I said, 'Why are you bringing that?', and he said, 'Because you're in it.' And I said, 'Do you <em>know</em>? Do you know my deep dark secret?'. And he said, 'Yes! I do know', and I said, 'Shh, keep it quiet!'"
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of Benson's role in Snake Eater comes as Konami continues its efforts to revitalise the Metal Gear Solid series following creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">acrimonious departure</a> from the publisher back in 2015. Last year saw the launch of Konami's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-mgs-master-collection-is-anything-but-masterful">less-then-stellar Metal Gear Solid Master Collection: Volume 1</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-will-include-mgs4">Volume 2 still to come</a>. First, however, it'll be releasing  its Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-despite-its-2024-window">still doesn't have a release date</a> despite its 2024 launch window.

Though I said it is impossible to summarize <em>Fourteen</em>, I will try to mention things that happen in it. It is the 23rd century. Animals do not exist in their natural form any more, and zoos are filled with horrifying chimeras. Meat is grown in vats, and out of one of those vats emerges a sentient chicken breast that grows into a body, a chicken-man. This chicken man becomes a doctor, and goes by the name Doctor Chicken George.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This image is burned in me (Read it right to left).

Meanwhile, children are being born with green hair and bodies, including the child of the president of the USA, who names his child America. At one point a briefcase is opened and a Tyrannosaurus Rex jumps out of it. All the trees die and the government gets the grandson of the writer of <em>Die Hard </em>to distract people with TV while they replant Central Park with plastic replicas. The mummy of Jesus Christ is discovered, but turns out to be a demon. All the air in Nepal disappears. I am skipping past a lot of things, and this barely covers the first half of the manga.</p><figure><figcaption>What a zoo looks like. Credit: Kazuo Umezu</figcaption></figure><p>In a career of recreating pubescent nightmares, <em>Fourteen </em>stands singularly as perhaps one of Umezu’s weirdest and most political. It jumps wildly from plot point to plot point, but the tone is intentionally humorous. It is a work that is deeply critical of mankind’s hatred and indifference to nature broadly and America’s role in the wholesale destruction of the planet specifically. It is a fever dream, and while you can debate that it is not coherent, its moral compass points clearly.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Kazuo Umezu</figcaption></figure><p>I would love to say that I bought <em>Fourteen</em> legally, but that’s not possible. It has never been translated and released legally, but it should be, because it’s one of the damnedest things I have ever read. A single panel stays more vividly than other works of art, the piercing gaze of Doctor Chicken George staring at the reader, having gained sentience after being told that his purpose is to be eaten. “I was born for no one.”</p><p>RIP to one of the best that ever lived.

			<p>Nexon has consistently kept The First Descendant at the forefront of graphics and display technologies. The free-to-play third-person looter shooter game looked great from the first time we saw it, but it was initially developed with Unreal Engine 4. However, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> to Unreal Engine 5 as soon as they could to take advantage of Nanite and Lumen, as they believed the latter in particular to be 'essential' for next-generation projects.</p>
<p>In the first interview published on Wccftech two years ago, the developers confirmed support for various ray traced effects, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, and Intel XeSS. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of its support for Samsung's HDR10+ displays, and a few months ago, The First Descendant was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to integrate NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, also known as Ray Reconstruction, which enhances ray tracing effects on GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>Nexon didn't just work hard on the PC version, anyway. The PlayStation 5 version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-descendant-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Unreal Engine 5's high-resolution Virtual Shadow map technique, as well as ray tracing and even AMD FSR Frame Generation, the latter of which is only available in two or three PS5 games so far.</p>
<p>It's not that surprising, then, that The First Descendant will also be the first PS5 Pro game to support the new PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution in combination with AMD FSR Frame Generation. Here's what Engine Programmer Junhwan Kim told Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our PS5 Pro-focused Q&amp;A</a>:</p>
<p><em>The most impressive aspect during the PS5 Pro adaptation process was the AI-driven upscaling technology known as PSSR. On the existing PS5 base model, the FSR Image Upscaling feature is typically used, which has some drawbacks, such as pixel ghosting and pixel jittering during the pixel reconstruction process. The PS5 Pro's Image Upscaling based on PSSR minimizes these weaknesses and delivers highly impressive results.</em></p>
<p><em>The original PS5 base model offered FSR upscaling and FSR frame generation features. On the PS5 Pro, we provide an option that combines PSSR with FSR frame generation, allowing for a higher-resolution, high-frame-rate experience compared to before.</em></p>
<p>The First Descendant on PS5 Pro will also feature improved ray tracing effects: ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced Lumen diffuse, ray-traced opaque, and translucency surface reflection.</p>
<p>But it's the implementation of both PSSR and AMD FSR Frame Generation that could really pave the way for optimal visual quality and performance on Sony's latest console, which is due to launch tomorrow at $699/£699/€799. We'll see whether more developers follow Nexon's example in this regard.</p>

			<p>The Stranger Things VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-things-vr-winter-2023/">made by Tender Claws</a> will be released for PlayStation VR2 and Steam VR. If you want to get your hands on this game based in the Stranger Things universe, you'll be able to pre-order it now for $24.99 via the PlayStation Store. For those who are PlayStation Plus members, you'll be eligible for a 20% discount. This title was originally released on Quest 2 and Quest 3 on February 22. However, it is now making its way onto more VR consoles and platforms to make the game more accessible. The art style is really cartoonist and stylized, making it perfect for those who want that indie feel to a game and to see the characters designed in a slightly different way.</p>

<p>This announcement comes just shortly before the announcement made by Netflix teasing the Stranger Things 5 title. This series is set to take place in the Fall of 1987 and is the "one last adventure," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-2LIjOt0rA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to release in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>In Stranger Things VR, you get to experience the world of Stranger Things from a never-seen-before perspective of Vecna. You get to explore unknown realities and work towards forming the hive mind. In this game, you're the villain in its entirety. You get to work to create your revenge plan and how you'll wreak havoc in the lives of Eleven and Hawkins.</p>
<p>While you get to play as Henry Creel, you'll get information that shows how he transforms into Vecna, as you can also invade the dreams and memories of some of the favorite characters in the show, such as Billy Hargrove and Will Byers. Additionally, you get to use the telekinetic powers that Vecna has in the show to possess the minds of others, as well as utilize them in combat against creatures.</p>
<p>The telekinetic powers allow you to grab, crush, and throw your opponents, which can make for some great chaos. As you slowly transform into Vecna, you get to relive Henry's memories from when he was in the Hawkins Lab with Dr. Brenner, allowing you to explore an interconnected hive mind with otherworldly properties.</p>
<p>One of the actions you can use can have severe consequences, but it's up to you whether you use it. You will be able to open and close portals between worlds and realities, but it is at your peril. Whether anything good will come of it remains to be seen in how you play the game.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Stranger Things VR?</p>
