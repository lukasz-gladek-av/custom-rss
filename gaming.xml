            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This Baseus Laptop Docking Station uses a single USB-C port on your laptop to turn it into a small docking station for two screens, a wired Ethernet connection, and various accessories. It has a sleek metal bar design with a very short built-in USB-C cable, allowing it to sit along the edge of your desk and expand the number of items you can connect via USB-C. With the dock, you’ll have space to connect two HDMI displays, wired Ethernet, SD and microSD cards, and multiple USB devices via a single USB-C connection, greatly reducing the number of dongles you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/">For only $38 at Amazon (usually $64), you can purchase this Baseus Laptop Docking Station, which represents a $26 discount, a 41% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station perfect for connecting all your important devices</h2>
<p>With the two HDMI outputs on the Baseus Laptop Docking Station, you can connect to two monitors with a single USB-C connection, eliminating the need for your laptop screen to carry the entire load. If you wish, you can mirror your primary display onto a larger TV or monitor to increase the size of your display area, or expand your desktop to provide additional space for documents, chat windows, and web browser tabs.</p>
<p>There is an integrated Ethernet port for a reliable wired connection when you experience Wi-Fi issues on your home network, such as heavy traffic or poor signal quality. By running one cable from the dock to your router, you can keep your desk organized while providing your laptop with a consistent, reliable internet connection for downloading, backing up to the cloud, and streaming. There are also three USB ports available, allowing you to keep a keyboard, mouse, flash drive, webcam, etc., plugged into the dock so they are ready whenever you start working at your desk. The integrated SD and microSD card slots make it easier to transfer your photos, video files, and other files without having to dig for another external card reader. Simply insert the card, copy what you need, and remove the card, all without having to reach behind your tower or monitor.</p>



<p>Support for Power Delivery enables the dock to power your laptop via the USB-C connection. This means that if you connect a powerful charger, you can charge your laptop while still using the other ports on the dock to charge other devices.</p>
<p>The aluminum-style housing of the Baseus Laptop Docking Station is designed to be small enough to fit beside your laptop or monitor, creating the appearance of an organic extension of your workspace rather than a large, clunky box. With this dock, you can access nine ports via a single USB-C cable, so you no longer have to deal with the clutter of old, single-function adapters. Since the dock is portable and only requires one USB-C cable, you can easily take it with you wherever you go, whether that is to another meeting room or a different office location. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/">At $38 instead of the usual $64 list price, the Baseus Laptop Docking Station is a cheap way to extend your laptop’s capabilities without upgrading.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game</a> is a beat-em-up we've repeatedly gone back to over the years, always wishing there was a bit more meat and fluidity to it. Thankfully, developer (and publisher) Tribute Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/15-years-later-scott-pilgrim-ex-proves-that-torontos-most-problematic-bass-player-has-what-it-takes-to-become-beat-em-up-royalty-in-2025">seem to be delivering exactly that with Scott Pilgrim EX</a>.</p>
<p>Following the release in late 2025 of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, the experienced, retro-inspired <a href="https://tributegames.com/">developer</a> will be dropping this follow-up of sorts to the 2010 classic on 3rd March, 2026. To celebrate the announcement, an all-new, stylish trailer has been shared, and it comes with two more additions to the character roster:</p> <figure>
<p>

<p>League of Evil Exes' Matthew Patel and Robot-01, a creation of the Katayanagi Twins, are joining the fight. The former mixes fire and "ritualistic showmanship" as seen in other Scott Pilgrim stories while summoning his "demon hipsters" before going for a grand finale with burning finishing moves. As for the robotic addition, it can fly and deliver precise blows with melee attacks and long-range weapons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a> isn't a direct sequel to previous Scott Pilgrim stories, or at least that's what creator Bryan Lee O'Malley <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottPilgrim/comments/1lbjf5n/scott_pilgrim_ex_is_not_a_direct_sequel_to_any/">said last year</a> when asked by confused fans. Regardless, we're betting having previous knowledge of the property helps, as the new adventure starts when the members of the Sex Bob-omb band are kidnapped "as the city (of Toronto) is terrorized by demons, vegans, and robots." Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers, plus five allies, lead the effort to save the musicians and the city, with "one final ally" being revealed ahead of launch. Place your bets now.</p>
<p>While physical editions have been teased to come soon, Scott Pilgrim EX will welcome fighters with a digital version only on 3rd March. It'll be hitting PC (Steam), PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Although the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">multiple delays</strong> may have dampened the enthusiasm of some fans, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> fever is growing each day as we get closer to the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">November 19 launch</a></strong>, as is the thirst for more information on the game. </p>



<p>While more leaks in the coming months are not entirely out of the question, Take-Two is reportedly going to limit them as much as possible by not<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-digital-only-launch/">releasing physical copies of the game at launch</a></strong>. A sensible choice, considering what some crazed fans have attempted to do in the past.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly, who consistently talks with former Rockstar Games employees, <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/2016319221333164304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2016319221333164304%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=notebookcheck.com"><strong>commented on the possibility of the sixth entry in the series not launching in retail stores</strong></a>. <em>"GTA 6 is going to be the biggest launch in entertainment history and by a wide margin, nothing will ever come close to it," Kiwi Talkz said. "GTA is a way bigger beast now than it was when GTA 5 launched, and I'd bet all my money that this game would leak early if there are physical discs."</em></p>



<p>Surprisingly enough, the danger of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">copies getting into the hands of players a few days earlier</strong> could not be the real reason why Grand Theft Auto 6 may not hit retail stores at launch. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unfortunately, there are a number of crazy Rockstar fans that would 100% break into retail stores and manufacturing facilities to steal discs, and people on the inside would leak it a</em></span><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">s well,"&nbsp;</em>Kiwi Talkz said. </p>



<p>This prediction is wholly justified.<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I have heard stories from Rockstar devs over the years of nutty fans trying to get into their buildings to get any info they can from faking IDs to flying drones above windows to try to get images/video,"</em> Kiwi Talkz added. Talk about emulating your favorite video game characters!</p>



<p>As <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"people are breaking into card stores to steal Pokémon Cards because of the hype and demand"</em>, as X user <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/Phischer/status/2016334510795981108"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Phischer Stanley highlighted,</strong></a> it really wouldn't be surprising to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">crazed fans pull an illegal stunt</strong> to get that coveted early look at <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. And it wouldn't even be unprecedented either: back in 2023, some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-leaker-review/">very early copies of Starfield illicitly got into the hands of people</a></strong> who did not hesitate to share more on the game before its launch.</p>



<p>Whether it’s flying drones or faking IDs, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">extreme lengths</strong> some fans are willing to go for a glimpse of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> proves that this isn't just a game launch. If Take-Two does indeed go with a digital-first strategy, it could mark a historic turning point for the industry, indicating that the risk of leaks may outweigh the rewards of a retail presence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you've been having trouble trying to play one of <strong>Embark Studios</strong> popular multiplayer titles, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-the-finals-season-9-dragon-rising/">The Finals</a></strong>, then you're not alone, as the studio has confirmed via the official ARC Raiders Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-and-the-finals-hit-by-coordinated-ddos-attacks">Eurogamer</a>) that both games are suffering from "<em>extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks</em>."</p>



<p>The game's community manager, <strong>Ossen</strong>, shared the following message earlier on Wednesday, with players in the server to confirm they are aware of the attack and that the studio is currently working to fight it.</p>



<p>"<em>Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks</em>. <em>The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing</em>." </p>



<p>The good news is that the latest update from Ossen, which was shared within the last hour states "<em>We are noticing that servers are recovering. Thanks for your patience and please let us know if you notice any more issues</em>." It has not been made clear, however, whether Embark Studios has resolved the issue entirely, so you could still experience issues when trying to log in for either game.</p>



<p>That said, the ARC Raiders Discord server is the only place Embark has addressed the issue, and the lack of a post on any of its other social media channels does seem to indicate that the issue is either close to being resolved, or has been resolved, since the team at Embark doesn't seem to deem it necessary to make players who may not be in the ARC Raiders Discord server aware of the situation.</p>



<p>If you want more signs that things are improving, you can also look to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">the SteamDB concurrent player numbers for ARC Raiders</a>, which did drop to the lowest point the game has seen since it launched, but has since begun to rise back to its usual activity. That said, ARC Raiders' lowest point since launch was still above <strong>100K</strong> concurrent players, proving that not even a DDoS attack can bring the popular extraction shooter below six figures of concurrent players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> PC player and you're sick of the game's poor performance on your rig, Capcom may have the answer to your prayers, and the studio has confirmed an enterprising player's theory about the source of some of the issues as well.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on Steam, Capcom says it's released a patch for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>that includes "optimization improvements for Steam-specific processes and options to reduce processing load", so your machine should have an easier time running the game now.</p><p>Capcom points to a CPU load issue caused by "claimed content status check processes" intended to notify players if unclaimed content is waiting for them, which confirms the results of an experiment performed by a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-poor-pc-performance-dlc-check-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22239c1b-456a-474c-ab0c-9209f9d66e0c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>According to Capcom, this problem should only cause <em>Wilds</em>' FPS to drop "in the Base Camp and Grand Hub", and how much DLC you own doesn't matter; if you have any unclaimed DLC at all, you may run into the issue.</p><p>More improvements and optimizations are planned for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, too; in February, another patch will arrive that aims to "reduce GPU processing load by adding quality levels (LOD) to the polygon mesh for 3D models".</p><p>In case you're wondering, LOD stands for "level of detail", and, as you can imagine, it refers to the amount of complexity in the detail of 3D models for characters and other assets.</p><p>Remarkably, Capcom says this solution would involve "swapping to low-resolution models for objects farther away from the camera", which implies that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>doesn't already do this. That would probably go some way towards explaining some of the FPS issues experienced by PC players. Yikes.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and its latest update can be downloaded right now on PC.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> developers Embark have warned players that the two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> have been hit by "extensive, co-ordinated DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks". The studio said these attacks were "ongoing" in a post put out at 11:59 AM GMT today.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> and The Finals have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks," Embark community manager Ossen wrote in said post to the Arc Raiders' official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1107613897357275188/1466040083780997211">Discord server</a>. "The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.</p>
<p>"Additionally, the team is also working on a hotfix which will solve some of the issues and unintended changes introduced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-update-rips-out-one-of-the-games-most-maddening-puzzles">yesterday's update</a>, we hope to have that available later today. We'll update you all on progress as we have more information to share!"</p>
<p>Since that point, Embark have pushed the hotfix live, fixing bugs which were reducing guns' rates of fire and slowing down looting. Their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1107613897357275188/1466080648522498190">latest post</a> as of writing reads: "We are noticing that servers are recovering. Thanks for your patience and please let us know if you notice any more issues."</p><p>So, judging by that, the situation should now be on the mend if you're hoping to jump into a match later today. Naturally, there's no word yet as to the source of such attacks, which come just after the deployment of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-asks-whether-extra-xp-is-enough-to-go-solo-in-a-group-lobby">Headwinds update</a>. It's typical, isn't it. The ice of winter thaws, and boom, a swirling storm of server issues slides right in. </p>
<p>How are you supposed to check out the extra birds Embark say they've added to the Buried City map? Hang on, maybe the DDoSing's down to some Dusky Tits and Dark-rumped Swifts deciding they'd rather not have their nests nicked from.</p>

            <guid>1418641</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s 2026, and if you’re still dealing with dead zones around your home and not getting the internet speeds you’re paying each month for, it’s time for an upgrade. A mesh WiFi system can help provide high-speed, whole-home internet coverage without paying for a full overhaul.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/">Right now, Amazon has knocked the 4-pack eero 6+ mesh Wi-Fi system by 32%, which brings its price down to just $300 – that’s after an impressive savings of $140.</a> The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime shoppers, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about. The offer is selling out fast, so it’s best to place your orders before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage</h2>
<p>The eero 6+ mesh Wi-Fi system is Amazon’s most affordable gigabit system ever. It supports wifi speeds up to a gigabit, and is even backward compatible with previous-generation eero devices. The system uses eero’s patented TrueMesh technology that automatically routes traffic to reduce drop-offs and dead spots, letting you experience consistent speeds in up to 4,500 sq. ft.</p>
<p>It uses Wi-Fi 6 to increase your internet efficiency and reduce network congestion. There’s enough bandwidth for the whole family to work, stream, and video chat. This system comfortably supports over 75 devices, so whether you want to catch up on your favorite show in the bedroom, download the latest gaming title on your PC, and hop on a call with friends on a tablet at the same time, you won’t have to deal with slowdowns. Connect all your important devices around the house without feeling limited. Basically, it’s great for working and studying from home, plus casual use.</p>



<p>Getting started is surprisingly straightforward. You just need to download the eero app on your smartphone, which guides you through setup and allows you to manage your network from anywhere remotely. Once you’ve plugged in your eero devices, your Wi-Fi will automatically optimize for your space with TrueMesh.</p>
<p>On a regular day, you’d pay around $440 to enjoy the stability and performance this 4-pack system offers.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/"> The current 32% discount, however, lets you upgrade and bring one home for just $300 today.</a> This limited-time (and rare) offer is selling out fast, though. If you’re finally ready to say goodbye to slow internet speeds and dead zones, now is the time to make the move. We suggest getting your orders without wasting much time, as discounts this good don’t stick around for long. That said, now is also a good time to grab some other connectivity essentials, as we’re spotting quite a lot of highly rated accessories going for less.</p>

<p>Reigns: The Witcher by Nerial and Devolver Digital releases for iOS, Android, Mac, and PC on February 25, 2026. </p>



<p>In recent days, we have been hearing a lot about the current and upcoming instalments of The Witcher series, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured expansion</a> for The Witcher 3 and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development and marketing budgets</a> for The Witcher 4. However, today we aren’t talking about any of these titles, but a spinoff within a choice-based title, Reigns. </p>







<h2 id="h-reigns-the-witcher-release-date-set-for-february-2026">Reigns: The Witcher Release Date Set for February 2026</h2>



<p>Nerial and Devolver Digital have teamed up with CD Projekt Red to introduce a new spinoff titled Reigns: The Witcher, as announced in the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9it7oMf0l00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a>. This game will incorporate Reigns’ signature decision-driven gameplay into The Witcher universe, featuring Geralt of Rivia as he navigates the ballads of Dandelion. Players will have the opportunity to explore a unique narrative experience, making choices that may involve running a hot bath instead of slaying monsters.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game will also feature beloved characters from the series, including Yennefer, Triss, and Vesemir. Players can look forward to numerous combat mini-games, where Geralt will face off against familiar foes such as ghouls and rotfiends. Ultimately, the decisions made throughout the game will have significant consequences; a wrong choice could provoke the mages, while the right choice could earn you respect among the nobles.</p>







<p>In other news, The Witcher 3’s rumoured expansion could take players to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3s-rumoured-expansion-could-take-players-to-a-new-region/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new region</a>. Additionally, Netflix’s live-action adaptation will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflixs-the-witcher-series-will-end-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conclude in 2026</a>.

In addition, two new playable characters have been revealed.</p><p>Today’s trailer showcases two more former enemies of Scott who will help him clean up the streets of Toronto: Matthew Patel and Robot-01. Matthew Patel is one of Ramona’s formerly evil exes, and his combat style emphasizes crowd control and manipulation. This is due to his ability to summon demon hipsters to distract enemies and lay traps on the field. Patel can also manipulate fire and summon supernatural arms.</p><p>Robot-01 was created by the Katayanagi Twins to harm Scott, but it now uses abilities, like firing long-range blasts and rocketing across the screen, to aid him. Robot-01 can also rain explosive projectiles, acting as a screen-clearing attack. See how Robot-01 and Patel hold their own in the trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>These two new faces join a playable roster consisting of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/27/scott-pilgrim-ex-adds-lucas-lee-and-roxie-richter-as-playable-characters">Lucas Lee, and Roxie Richter</a>. Up to four players can play locally or online to bash their way through an original adventure, which features new music from Anamanaguchi, the band behind Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game’s soundtrack.</p><p>Scott Pilgrim EX is launching on March 3 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.

            <p>Many fans rushed to scream Leon S. Kennedy had aged like fine wine when he showed up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">December 2025 trailer</a>. That's a sentiment most of us can agree with, and it appears we also have to thank Capcom's female developers for their attention to detail.</p>
<p>At least that's what Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi revealed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">during a chat with Automaton</a>: "We've spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon's visuals. Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck."</p>
<p>With Requiem's story being set around 20 years after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4</a>, Leon is now comfortably sporting an authentic dad/uncle look that makes him a true veteran who's seen too many horrors for a single lifetime. Regardless, he's back for more action alongside Grace Ashcroft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">with the latter favouring a tenser survival horror gameplay loop</a>.</p>
<p>Leon's design wasn't locked early on, either. Nakanishi revealed it actually changed over the course of making the game: "Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb." It sure sounds like they were thinking about the thirstiest fans during the entire process.</p><p>The employees' suggestions went beyond Leon's look as well, with Nakanishi also stating "every staff member had their own interpretation of Leon’s 30-year-long history." Considering Resident Evil's storied journey over so many entries, it comes as no surprise developers that have also grown up with the series had heated feedback for the top creatives. "After many discussions, we were able to settle on something that clicked for us. When players see this Leon in the game, hopefully they will be able to find their own interpretation of him as well," the director added.</p>
<p>Fans won't have to wait long now to spend as much time as they want with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiems-director-on-why-re9-wont-suffer-the-same-multi-protagonist-woes-as-re6-and-why-its-more-like-sushi">Leon and Grace</a>; Resident Evil Requiem will infect PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-wanted-mouse-support-in-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-but-it-confused-the-gameplay">even Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 27th February, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft's</strong> recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> continues to ripple through the video game industry, and now it has led to what was arguably an inevitable point in this story, as French unions representing Ubisoft workers, namely <strong>Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du jeu Vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT</strong>, and <strong>Printemps écologique</strong>, have called for a <strong>strike</strong> in response to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">recent layoffs, studio closures, and the proposed end to remote work policies under a return-to-office mandate</a>. </p>



<p>The strike called by the French unions will be a three-day event, taking place on <strong>February 10, 11, </strong>and <strong>12,</strong> with the unions calling for all Ubisoft workers worldwide to join them in the demonstration. It's also not the only demonstration planned, as the <strong>CWA Canada</strong> is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mdggnk5yos26">set to hold a rally in Halifax this coming <strong>Thursday, January 29, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> in solidarity with the workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">who were laid off when Ubisoft shut down its Halifax studio earlier this month</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Enough is enough!</em>" begins a collaborative statement from the STJV and the aforementioned French unions. "<em>Faced with the arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn't even dare talking to employees anymore, unions are calling for a strike on February 10th, 11th, and 12th</em>."</p>







<p>The statement shared goes on to further call out Ubisoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, claiming that he and Ubisoft management are going back on a remote work policy deal that was in place since <strong>September 2025</strong>, and further calls out the company's top brass for not taking responsibility for their actions that have led to this major restructure. A fair point to make, since you might recall that Guillemot and the current Ubisoft leadership led the company to lose <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">95% of its total value in the last eight years</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"<em>We are told about responsibilities,</em> <em>but those who wield this word so easily do not take any responsibility for the consequences of their catastrophic management, the latest result being the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">elimination of 200 jobs at Ubisoft's headquarters</a></em>."</p>



<p>Prior to this strike call, earlier this week, French union Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">directly called out Guillemot for having "<em>no knowledge or understanding of his company</em>."</a></p>



<p>Ubisoft's "<em>major reset</em>" reorganized the company into five Creative Houses, with its various branching studios across the world put into at least one of the five houses, if they survived the restructure. Ubisoft claims the Halifax and Stockholm studio shutdowns were part of this restructure, as were layoffs announced last year at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive Entertainment</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">RedLynx</a></strong>. We also know that the restructure is responsible for pushing out senior veteran talent at Ubisoft, with the company losing its lead on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">Assassin's Creed</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">The Division</a></strong>. The former is <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">even suing Ubisoft for "<em>constructive dismissal</em>."</a></p>



<p>The reset also saw six projects get cancelled, including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong> and seven more delayed, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>. In all of this mess, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/"><strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> survived</a>, and is still in production, according to Ubisoft.</p>



<p>It's still early days as to how the dust will settle with this restructure. While French unions put pressure on Ubisoft in the company's home country, the CWA Canada <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">continues to apply pressure to the Nova Scotia government and the Canadian public to carefully scrutinize the closure of the Halifax studio,</a> pressure that has already resulted in Ubisoft reconsidering the severance package it would offer workers. The union has also <a href="https://ubisoftworkerscanada.com/">kicked off a letter-writing campaign and published a timeline outlining why it believes the closure to be suspect</a>, as the Nova Scotia Labour Board investigates.</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Wccftech for further reporting on the situation at Ubisoft as it develops.</p>

            <p>Remember in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers when Gandalf falls down the big chasm with the Balrog, smacking the sawdust out of it while plummeting towards the waters of the underworld? Well, give Gandalf a gun, play that sequence in reverse, and swap the Balrog for a flock of Space Invaders, and you are playing something like the demo for Dwarf Legacy – a “bullet-hell precision platformer” from Wulo Games about a dwarf clambering up the inside of a mountain. </p>
<p>Oh wait, Gandalf needs to be listening to crunchy dancefloor music to complete the analogy. Also, he needs to stop periodically to buy better guns from a blacksmith. I’m pretty sure this is still within Peter Jackson’s budget.</p><!--more-->

<p>“Bullet-hell precision platformer” is a verbal fondue calculated to give you palpitations, so it’s alarming that Dwarf Legacy feels very easy, to begin with. Your jump is insanely floaty, and you can stick to walls without worrying about stamina. This isn’t exactly your classic, slow-moving, hard-wearing Dwarven miner. Even Legolas wasn’t this quick on his pins.</p><p>The odds soon steepen, however. The gun, once acquired, can only be shot in fixed directions – vertically, if you’re jumping or standing on the floor, or horizontally, if you’re hanging from a wall. Upgrade the gun to fire an extra bullet per shot, and the additional rounds shoot out parallel or at 45 degree diagonals, as with multishot upgrades in shmups.</p>
<p>Those constraints are all fine and dandy when you’re only fighting a handful of foes, and have room to manoeuvre. But when you’re dogfighting with a crowd in cramped confines, while avoiding spinning blade traps and spikes… yes, this is a test of Dawi mettle indeed. Fortunately, enemies take damage from traps, and have deliberately brainless pathfinding - some gauntlet runs encourage you to lure them to their destruction.</p>
<p>Between clambers, you’ll return to and gradually populate a cave village of upgrade-peddling NPCs. There’s some gently diverting writing, like the botanist who’s ecstatic at the chance to grow vegetables in pitch darkness. Another dweller offers optional challenges to encourage replay of completed areas, on top of the bonuses you'll earn from a higher completion score.</p><p> 

The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2426280/Dwarf_Legacy/">full version of Dwarf Legacy</a> is out later this year, and will offer a few dozen levels across several distinct chunks of mountain strata. Oh, I forgot to mention a couple of Neat things. Firstly, when you grab a surface your character automatically plants a torch, lighting the level in an organic way.
</p><p>Secondly, when you take damage, it dings your helmet off rather than killing you. You can reclaim your helmet to restore that diegetic second chance mechanic. I’d almost beaten the 10th level in the demo, but then some stinkbug bonked my hat off a precipice and I chased it almost all the way to the bottom. Fun! It occurs to me that Gandalf lost his hat during the Balrog descent, and somehow reached the bottom unscathed – truly, he is the, er, Dwarf Legacy of wizards.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bg3-swen-vincke-highguard-concord-steam-reviews-metacritic-2000663800</link>
            <guid>1418572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The launch of <em>Highguard</em> this week has reignited a debate around good manners. Over a hundred people worked for several years on a project they were passionate about. Instead of everyone giving it a fair shake and casually talking about what they did or didn’t like about it, the conversation around the new multiplayer shooter was quickly subsumed by a torrent of knee-jerk negativity. Social media is full of people dunking on the game for clout and Steam reviews are full of users who barely touched it on PC before rushing to grade it almost entirely based on hardware performance.</p> <p>It’s the culmination of an increasingly fractured online ecosystem whose only unifying forces are algorithms that reward rage-bait and endless free content that incentivizes harsh snap judgements in order to sort through it all. If you’re not first, you’re last. If you’re not the best, who cares? The swift, loud, and in many cases overly <a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-highguard-game-awards-trailer-hate-2000663574">toxic reaction to <em>Highguard</em></a> has some developers concerned, disgusted, and confused.</p>

 <p>“I don’t like people shitting on things others have created,” <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> director and Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974">wrote on X</a> last night. He spent most of his short “soapbox” speech talking about game reviews, which seem completely tangential to what’s going on with <em>Highguard</em> at the moment. He wants them to be less mean and personal; most fans wants them to feel less inflated and overly deferential to the publishers behind the product. But importantly, almost no one has actually <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/highguard/">even reviewed <em>Highguard</em> yet</a>. Maybe we wait for it to get a Metacritic score before we start assigning one to all of its critics, another one of Vincke’s suggestions.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t like people shitting on things others have created. Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand…</p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nevertheless, the veteran RPG maker ended with <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429">a call for more civility</a>. “It’s been on my mind for a while and just opening my feed today just pushed it all to the surface,” he wrote. “Think of the time you had to recite something in front of the class and how nervous you were. And how much any negative comment hurt.&nbsp;Be nice to one another, be nice to the people creating stuff to entertain you. Treat them like you would like to be treated if you made something.”</p>

 <p>Vincke wasn’t the only one ruffled. “When did it become trendy to hate on a new game?” <a href="https://x.com/therealcliffyb/status/2016245017073877329">wrote</a> Cliff Bleszinski on X. “Been seeing it more and more in recent years. It’s exhausting.” Epic Games co-founder Mark Reign <a href="https://x.com/markrein/status/2016346300367729008">quoted-tweeted him</a>: “It’s downright horrible. Especially a FREE game from a new studio. Just so sad. This is a hobby for people, they should approach with joy not hatred.”</p>

 <p>Remedy Entertainment Communications Director Thomas Puha was disheartened by how player counts have become weaponized against games in recent years. “Tired of seeing headlines of how many players<em> Highguard</em> has lost,” he <a href="https://x.com/riotrmd/status/2016431155524809143">posted</a>. “Like, sure, you can argue that’s putting facts out there, but I cant escape the feeling there’s just this ‘celebration’ of a game doing badly and just putting out negative headlines for the sake of it. Shouldn’t us game devs even try?”</p> <h2>Another hero shooter meltdown</h2> <p>We could try to psychoanalyze why the online gamer id has latched onto these narratives so zealously rather than just, you know, play the games and enjoy them or move on. Part of it is no doubt an ongoing backlash against the very concept of live-service games. Despite being far and away the most played and profitable genre, there’s a certain type of player that resents the gravity well they’ve created. For one swath of YouTube culture war peddlers, <em>Concord</em>‘s failure was celebrated as a defeat for progressive values in the marketplace. But for others it became symbolic vindication that all of these companies pumping resources into microtransaction casinos were idiots to do so.</p>

 <p>Perhaps they’re simply exhausted with the modern live-service game trying to take over their life and their wallet. Once upon a time, the big scandal was publishers using sticks (single-use multiplayer codes) and carrots (bonus DLC) to get people to stop buying used games. Now the sale of most games is inconsequential. The real bucks are made in the in-game shop and the only way to keep making them is to keep people playing as much as possible. For fans of forever games who love hanging out with their friends in them, no harm done. For someone who doesn’t want their hobby to become like a second job, it’s easy to see where burnout and backlash might ensue.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:aa23o5w4w2afknay44oqxqz6/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdhctp2krs27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreido643tuq2buamxesheusn2qdf6afvac2dbcuhe3mcmtoe6zggxoe"> <p lang="en">Try a couple decades of shitty emails ranging from simple insults all the way up to death threats from idiot fanboys who can't handle you giving a game "only" 8/10 and see which one puts more calluses on your soul, dummy. You'd fold in six months or less.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:aa23o5w4w2afknay44oqxqz6?ref_src=embed">Jeff Gerstmann (@jeffgerstmann.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:aa23o5w4w2afknay44oqxqz6/post/3mdhctp2krs27?ref_src=embed">2026-01-28T03:18:56.524Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>It does not help that <em>Highguard</em>, despite being inspired by games like <em>Rust</em>, sounds like a knock-off of <em>Overwatch</em> and includes some very generic-looking characters to boot. Made by some of the leads on <em>Apex Legends</em>, the contrast between the launches of those two multiplayer games shows not just a possible increase in live-service fatigue in the intervening years but also the decay of the wider ecosystem where all of those issues get hashed out. “Covid transformed social media into an endless, awful conversation; once you pop, the horrors never stop,” writes <a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-release-steam-pc-concord-youtube-shadow-drop/">Nathan Grayson at <em>Aftermath</em></a>. He adds, “Recent years have only worsened this dynamic, with short-form video content taking over as the predominant mode of expression and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers/"><u>giving rise to a generation of caustic clip farmers</u></a> who yank at the udder of any perceived drama of the week until it’s chafed and bone dry. Then they move onto the next thing and deploy the same playbook again.”</p> <p>In this milieu of brainrot it’s harder than ever, but also more urgent, to separate bad-faith trolling, drama-farming, and review-bombing campaigns from genuine dislike and revulsion when a game sucks or, more often, just doesn’t have the juice. “Let people fucking hate shit,” <em>Giant Bomb</em> co-founder Jeff Gerstmann <a href="https://youtu.be/CLJErsnsVwc?t=1391">recently joked on his podcast</a>. “Let people be fucking people! Grow up. It’s okay to criticize things that are fucking dumb.” It was in response to someone calling him out for making fun of people with glass-case gaming PCs that let you see inside the rig, but it applies just as much to an ambient strain in gaming discourse that would prefer people with nothing nice to say to say nothing at all.</p>

 <p>The breakdown of the internet has only made criticism more important, not less, and raised the stakes for doing so responsibly and honestly. That requires an open mind, a generous spirit, and an unflinching commitment to saying what you mean and meaning what you say. Also avoiding Twitter and every other irradiated social media platform as much as humanly possible.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios has confirmed that both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and the Finals have been hit by DDoS attacks, claiming they were both "extensive" and "co-ordinated".</p>
<p>These problems first started in the early hours of the morning, with reports of mass instability impacting both games. While initially some stability was brought back to the servers, this soon deteriorated again as the DDos attacks continued.</p>
<p>In an update posted on the official Arc Raiders Discord server a few hours ago, community manager Ossen wrote: "Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing."</p>

</figure>
<p>This effort to resolve the connectivity problems coincided with work on a hotfix targeting unintended changes with the recent major update, which altered the fire rate of some weapons, led to some earned cosmetics going missing, and more.</p>
<p>In the last hour, Ossen updated Arc Raiders players on the DDos issue, stating: "We are noticing that servers are recovering." Whether the DDoS attacks have concluded, or Embark has resolved the issue entirely, remains unclear.</p>
<p>This attack comes only a day following<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you"> the release of a new solo vs squad game mode, as well as a Bird City map condition</a>. It's worth noting that even with this ongoing DDoS attack, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">SteamDB still tracks well over 100,000 players still in-game</a>.</p>
