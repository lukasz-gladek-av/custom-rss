            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Can you believe <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> only came out three months ago? For all the anguish, criticism and hand-wringing it inspired it feels more like 17 years. </p><p>Surveying this discourse, you'd be forgiven for thinking (if you hadn't played it yourself) that this was one of the worst games of the year! Such is the nature of video game discussion today, fuelled by the decline of the website, the rise of the thumbnail reaction face and the obliteration of traditional social media channels. This game cost money, came from a big publisher and had an even bigger license attached to it. It was set in a universe with a toxic waste dump for a fandom, while starring a woman in the lead role. There's no room for nuance when the stakes are that high. No room to explore what the game is and what it’s trying to do. The Emperor's thumb, as driven by algorithms as it is, can only point up or down.</p><figure></figure><p>I didn't play <em>Outlaws</em> in August for two reasons: One, I couldn't afford to buy it at the time. And two, I'd been cursed by that discourse. When<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a big review scores the game 2/5 and makes very convincing arguments</a>, I'm affected. When normal people make seemingly valid complaints about Ubisoft's tired open world formula,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-mirage-was-juuusssttt-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as someone bored with some recent <em>Assassin's Creed </em>games, that hit home</a>. And as someone who has all but fallen out of love with <em>Star Wars</em> following Disney's decade and change of neglect, even the license held little appeal.</p><p>But I played it across November and December, after a number of patches and updates to the game have done everything from solve some technical issues to making stealth sections easier. And let me tell you: I think it's fuckin' great.</p><p>I'm not here to diminish people's very understandable concerns with so much of this game's design. A lot of the negative reviews were right, from a certain point of view: <em>Outlaws </em>has problems. Whole sections are broken or pointless (the criminal influence system especially), there are dumb restrictions on stuff like weapon use (you only carry one gun permanently), space combat is underbaked, the speeder is a nightmare to control, I could go on forever. And would, if others hadn't done so already.</p><p>I am here, though, to point out that a lot of those issues (though not all!) were clearly caused by a major publisher, desperate for an injection of cash, rushing a licensed AAA game onto the market before it was ready. And that the three months since launch have seen the game markedly improved. It's still weird that you can pick up other people's guns only sometimes, but at least now you don't drop them every time you climb a ladder. It's still annoying that you can't hide bodies you knock out silently during stealth sections, but now if you're discovered there are no more instafails, so you can at least blast your way out.</p><p>Basically, whatever game it was that people played and reviewed and posted and talked about in August, that game was from August. The one you'll be playing in December is slightly different and, if any of the affected stuff matters to you, better.</p><figure></figure><p>A lot of the criticism of <em>Outlaws </em>upon release seemed based on what it wasn't--it wasn't as sneaky as <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, wasn't as blasty as <em>The Division</em>, etc--so let's spend a little time talking about what it <em>is</em>. It's a game where you play as Kay Vess, a young criminal making her way through the galaxy on her first big score. Well, second...the first got a bounty put on her head, so you're also making your way through the galaxy trying to clear that. You've got your own ship, your own crew, you have a little rodent sidekick. You visit a number of <em>Star Wars</em> planets--some of them with large open worlds to explore--and there's a combination of main storyline quests, contracts and card games to keep you busy.</p><p>Sometimes you get to ride a skittish speederbike, which can be frustrating (you crash a lot!) or amazing (sunsets over Tatooine!). Other times you fly a spaceship and shoot at TIE Fighters in a way that feels like a mobile port of <em>Star Wars Squadrons</em>. And sometimes you get to play cards. The first two are lowpoints. The latter is, depending on how much you enjoy games-within-games, one of the finest examples of the genre.</p><p>You spend the vast majority of your time in <em>Outlaws </em>just walking around. A lot. Exploring towns, talking to people; you do a bunch of missions, most of which involve sneaking around somewhere (hence the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> comparisons), and some of which are closer to something like <em>Tomb Raider</em> or <em>Uncharted</em>, where you just explore a wreck/ruin and do some basic platforming.</p><p>That sneaking has been one of the discourse's main bones of contention, because for such a cornerstone of the experience, it's not great. Combat isn't much better; aside from a neat trick where you can use different types of blast for different enemies, it's plagued by poor AI and a disastrously poor cover system (in that there kinda isn't one).</p><p>It's not an unplayable <em>disaster</em>; you can have fun on these missions. There are some problems to solve and some bank vaults to rob, and it never gets old sneaking up on space fascists and punching them in the face. I'm also going to take this opportunity to express my love for Nix, your little space cat sidekick who is there primarily as a quality-of-life tool, able to fetch distant items and distract enemies with the push of a button. This game would not have been what it is without him.</p><p>If the missions are just fine, and other parts are not great, and some other parts are even <em>terrible</em>, then isn't <em>Outlaws</em>--despite the updates and patches and supposed improvements--still the same thing everyone was shitting on earlier in the year? How can a stealth game with busted stealth and a shooting game with no cover and an open world game with an uncontrollable speeder bike be "fuckin’ great"?</p><p>Because I don't care about any of that. This is not <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. It's not <em>Uncharted</em>, it's not <em>Tomb Raider,</em> it's not <em>Gears of War</em>. It's not <em>Pod Racer</em>, it's not <em>Squadrons</em>, it's not anything else it's been compared to and found wanting against. This is <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and it doesn't exist to challenge your expectations of the stealth genre, nor to redefine the open world experience for the 21st century. It's a <em>Star Wars </em>game that wants to be maybe the most <em>Star Wars</em> game ever made, and I think it comes pretty close.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Outlaws </em>is, before anything else, an adaptation. That's what Ubisoft spent the money on. The company already has multiple open world AAA franchises, it didn't pay Disney to compete with itself. It paid for <em>Star Wars</em>, for Darth Vader and Rodians and Stormtroopers, and that's what <em>Outlaws </em>does best. It's a game that shines when you're doing some of the (quite literally) most pedestrian acts like walking around, talking to people and soaking up the sights. And it knows this; the game is full of locations and moments where you're specifically prompted to press a button that just leans you on a railing, or sits you down at a cafe, and lets you watch the world--full of very <em>Star Wars</em> characters chatting and going about their lives--pass you by.</p><p>It does this so well that even its dalliances into cliche end up being highlights. You will once again visit Tatooine during this game, but it's not the tiresome recap you might have expected, yet another superficial representation of George Lucas' late-90s reinvention of the place. <em>Outlaws </em>has such a love for the universe's traditions, and such a meticulous eye for detail, that this Tatooine feels more like Ralph McQuarrie's version of the planet: a desolate frontier place, a spaghetti Western with laser guns. It was a pleasure to explore every inch of its Mos Eisley and poke my head into corners only previously glimpsed.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking down the stairs into<em> New Hope's</em> famous cantina was a distinct highlight. That cantina is part of my memories of what used to be my favourite movie; the power of walking into a perfect recreation of it set in an open world video game can't be understated. This is the burden, but also the power, of a thoughtful adaptation. People loved the wizard game despite its flaws, and <em>Alien Isolation</em> is still spoken of in hushed tones over a decade later. <em>Outlaws </em>is in the same category, its love for the source material (specifically, the late-70s source of the source material) shining through everywhere from costume design to sound effects.</p><p>It's not <em>Outlaws</em>' fault that it arrived at a time when public conversations about <em>Star Wars</em> has become a minefield,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> for reasons both easy and difficult to explain</a>. This game doesn't care about Skywalkers, or cancelled movies, or terrible TV shows, or online <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culture wars</a>, or pretty much anything that has contributed to the dire state of things in 2024. All it wanted to do was bring the original trilogy's vibe to life in a lavish, immersive video game space. For all its other missteps, it absolutely nails that.</p><p>There's so much irony in the fact so many chuds, so many middle-aged lifelong <em>Star Wars</em> fans, were so hostile to this game, because <em>Outlaws </em>is exactly the kind of thing people have wanted from a <em>Star Wars </em>game for so long. <em>Andor </em>is the closest comparison here, an exploration of the universe free from the burden of its lore, that doesn't try to weave itself into an existing story and whose lone encounter with the Force is to treat it as a mind-blowing party trick, not a sacred code. <em>Outlaws </em>is just a game about a single, likeable kid caught up in the events of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, which, like in <em>Andor</em>,<em> </em>looms enormously when the camera is free to zoom out from the Skywalker family and Jedi Council.</p><p>I loved every weird <em>Star Wars</em> guy I met playing <em>Outlaws</em>. I loved every shitty little bar and every sterile Imperial base. I loved riding around Tatooine (when I could go in a long straight line) and flying a spaceship through a debris field (when nobody was shooting at me). I loved the way my little gun sounds just like a <em>Star Wars</em> gun should, and that my spaceship's cockpit looks just like a <em>Star Wars</em> ship's cockpit should.</p><p>I loved all that shit because, in spite of the discourse, in spite of the missteps and crimes committed by Disney over the past decade, I still have love in my heart for <em>Star Wars</em>. Not <em>all </em>of it, of course, but I was born in the 1980s, and that's the <em>Star Wars</em> this game doubles down on. It's a cultural security blanket, an old friend, a cherished photograph on the shelf. The team at Massive (and everyone else who worked on it, it's a big Ubisoft collab) deserve a ton of praise for the lengths the art and sound and writing and design have gone to here to make everything look and feel like it came straight out of the original film trilogy.</p><p>The beauty of a good adaptation--and this is what people miss when they lament the lack of movie tie-in games, not the rushed development and rudimentary gameplay--is that it's something beyond a video game. As a video game, <em>Outlaws </em>had, and still has, issues! The stealth still needs more visual feedback and options, the gunplay is maddening without cover and space combat probably shouldn't have been in the game at all. Some of those frustrations will be addressed in updates; others we're likely stuck with forever.</p><p>As a <em>Star Wars</em> game, though? One that lets you spend 20-30 hours really living inside the universe, warts and all? This is one hell of a game.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I am devastated to see my man Davrin so low. Y’all don’t know what you’re missing. More for me, fuck y’all. Anyway, Emmrich, the older gentleman of the group is on the very bottom, which isn’t surprising given some cowards would likely view him as “too old” for protagonist Rook.

While Outie Mark (Adam Scott) was under the impression that his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) was dead, Innie Mark knows she’s alive after seeing her photo because Gemma is the silently tortured Ms. Casey, the Wellness Counselor from the Severed building, who appeared in previous episodes. The only problem is, Innie Mark had already begun an office romance with Innie Helly (Britt Lower). Stiller says the second season will unravel the tangled web of this interdimensional love affair.</p><p>“Is Outie Mark going to find out that Innie Mark knows? And how is Outie Mark going to deal with that? At the same time, I think we’ve sort of developed a relationship with Innie Mark and Helly on the inside that feels like it’s going somewhere. So there’s a natural tension that’s growing there between Outie Mark’s interests and Innie Mark’s interests.”</p><p>In the world of <em>Severance, </em>hugs have to pre-approved by higher ups and communicating with yourself (well, your Innie sending messages to your Outie) can be met with strict punishments. So, an Innie uncovering a insidious connection between the outside and inside worlds will undoubtedly have some unsavory consequences in a season where series creator Dan Erickson says “things get darker.” The Innies gained enlightenment of their existence. But, at what cost?</p><p>“The information that has come out into the world that Mark’s wife is alive—if that is actually something that people believe and follow up on, it would have ramifications, obviously, for Lumon going forward,” Stiller explains. “And if Lumon somehow gets exposed, what would happen to the lives of all these Innies who, basically, only exist in Lumon?”</p><p>Stiller will probably propose more questions for us to consider on his and Scott’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-podcast-ben-stiller-adam-scott-1851710455?_gl=1*12ckg9k*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzMzNDQ1Ny44Ni4xLjE3MzMzNDc3NTcuMTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-podcast-ben-stiller-adam-scott-1851710455?_gl=1*12ckg9k*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzMzNDQ1Ny44Ni4xLjE3MzMzNDc3NTcuMTQuMC4w"><em>Severance</em> podcast</a></span> when it premieres on January 7, ten days before the show itself returns on the 17th. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been anywhere on the internet in the last few months, the chances are you’ll have seen a guy dressed as Miles Morales pretending to be an NPC on stream. He’s one of the few still holding up the gimmick – or at least he was, until now.</p>



<p>The ‘NPC trend’ went wild on sites like TikTok a while back, and ‘NPC Miles Morales’ was by far the most prolific creator to do it. He’d go on stream for hours on end, performing Miles Morales’s (Spider-Man) voice lines and ‘animations’ in exchange for gifts and donations.</p>



<p>He’s announced that he’s giving it up after all these months and pursuing a traditional streaming career.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>



<p>NPC Miles Morales – whose real name is Malik Ambersley – has performed his role since midway through 2023, and over time, he has become increasingly popular and controversial. While streaming, he has been robbed, accosted by police, and gotten into fights, all the while performing a character that he rarely breaks from.</p>



<p>The bit has earned him a substantial amount of money, but to be honest, he has put in the work. What he does is physically demanding and requires a great deal of confidence – and his escapades eventually earned him an iconic spot in Kai Cenat’s recent Mafia 2 subathon.</p>



<p>Now that Ambersley has paired up with Cenat, he has become bigger than ever, and in a recent stream, he revealed that he’s hanging up the Miles Morales costume to pursue traditional activities, such as the ‘IRL streams’ that Kai Cenat is famous for.</p>



<p>He said he’d ‘rather be known for being himself’.</p>



<p>Have you ever caught NPC Miles Morales on stream? Let us know what you think about the character on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a> and Predator: Hunting Grounds developer IllFonic has announced an unspecified number of layoffs, as it 'realigns to a refined strategy'.
</p>
<p>
IllFonic CEO and co-founder Charles Brungardt confirmed the job cuts in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/illfonic_an-update-from-illfonic-activity-7270138603437989888-6BkN">statement posted to social media</a>. "Today," he wrote, "we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic... It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we realigned to a refined strategy."
</p>
<p>
"There is a lot of talent in the group," Brungardt continued, "and if you or your team is hiring, please reach out so people can be connected to open roles."

<p>
IllFonic - which has studios in Golden, Colorado and Tacoma, Washington - is perhaps best known for its asymmetrical multiplayer horror Friday the 13th: The Game, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-dev-bestows-max-power-on-all-players-ahead-of-shutdown">pulled from sale last December</a> after the company's license rights expired.
</p>
<p>
The developer has since attempted to replicate the formula with this year's Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, but its Steam concurrents have <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1556100/charts/#6m">plummeted from the hundreds to double digits</a> in recent months, suggesting it's struggled to resonate with players.
</p><p>
IllFonic hasn't revealed the number of employees affected by today's layoffs, but the news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry. Around <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">14,000 workers</a> are believed to have lost their jobs since the start of the year, in addition to the 10,500 laid off in 2023. So why's this happening? GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">shared his thoughts</a> earlier this year.

In fact, the fourth game in the franchise only imports three choices from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, a stark departure from its predecessor which used a whole separate app to let you craft a world state based on hundreds of previous decisions. While that limitation lingers over <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare says this shouldn’t signal to fans that choices from games as far back as the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> can’t factor into a future game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

The final game only implements three decisions specifically regarding the Inquisitor, the protagonist of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. These choices mainly end up affecting a few lines of dialogue, and meanwhile, <em>The Veilguard </em>goes out of its way to avoid actually addressing anything else the player may have done in previous games. Every returning character’s dialogue is written in a way that they could have feasibly ended up where they do in the sequel regardless of whatever choices you may have made. Some minutiae falls through the cracks, like Isabela talking as if she joined the player in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, when it was possible to play that game without recruiting her. But broadly, BioWare chose to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112">take more care to not contradict players’ choices</a></span> than to represent them. This was a far cry from the studio’s previous work, and while I appreciate the care the team took to not step on toes, I think most fans were surprised to find something that felt so severed from previous games, especially as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story ties up so many loose ends from across the franchise.</p><p>The studio has said that it planned on using the geographical distance between the events of the southern regions of Thedas in previous games and the northern setting of <em>The Veilguard</em> to get narrative distance. However, Busche explained to <em>IGN </em>that just because a decision from <em>Origins</em>, <em>DAII</em>, or <em>Inquisition</em> didn’t factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story, that doesn’t mean it can’t be imported in a future game.</p><p>“The big thing for us is we wanted to make this story, every single choice you make, feel relevant to it,” Busche said. “One thing that we could have stated more clearly or maybe alluded to more clearly in the game is the idea that just because these choices from the past library of games didn’t necessarily impact this particular story, that doesn’t mean they’re gone. This is a chance for us to really key in to what matters with these events and what’s happening in Northern Thedas. I do fully expect that these choices going clear back to <em>Dragon Age Origins</em> will again matter. So just wanted to be on record with that. Every one of your choices that people have made throughout their <em>Dragon Age</em> journey, those are still your choices.

It would be a simple, harmless error if wicked.com didn’t direct people to Wicked Pictures, a pornographic production studio that’s been around for over 30 years (and has had that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=Wicked.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=Wicked.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website domain</a></span> for just as long). The lawsuit, filed by South Carolina mom Holly Ricketson, alleges that on or around November 11, she purchased one of those <em>Wicked </em>dolls for her young daughter and was shocked when her child showed her the Wicked.com site which, she says, “pasted scenes of pornographic advertisements across her phone screen.”</p><p>She claims her child was exposed to full-on nude sex scenes. Mattel issued a recall of the dolls but didn’t offer a refund. By explicitly advertising the toys to children aged as young as four, the lawsuit alleges the company neglected its duty to produce an appropriate product, packaging and all.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>While the toy giant didn’t directly address the lawsuit, it did argue that erroneously including a porn website on its packaging “in no way impacts the value or play experience provided by the product itself in the limited number of units sold before the correction.”</p><p>While Mattel appears to want to separate the packaging from the actual product, in terms of what the company is actually selling to children, there may be another way out of culpability.<strong> </strong>When you visit wicked.com, the first image you get is an age gate prompt that explains how the content on the page is restricted and only intended for viewing by those 18 years of age or older, with no pornographic images visible. Let’s say her child aimlessly clicked “enter,” as we all do when provided with a list of terms and conditions that could literally involve us consenting to giving our data to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI overlords</a></span> for all we know. When I checked (for purely journalistic reasons), no advertisements flashed on my screen, and everyone depicted on the home page was fully clothed, even if they were scantily clad. It’s possible the child could have continued clicking through screens in search of <em>Wicked</em> content, and eventually stumbled upon the type of content her mother alleges she was exposed to on the site. But, this might be a case of principle vs practicality where, to the mom, the fact her child was directed to a site that contained pornography trumped the possibility<strong> </strong>that her child maybe didn’t “immediately” show her mom when she got on the site, as the lawsuit claims,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and rather showed her mom the results of her going through the site on her own. </p><p>Even with the doll recall happening 11 days before the movie debuted, the Broadway adaptation still raked in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$114 million</a></span> at the box office in the United States alone in its opening weekend. With a <em>Wicked Part II </em>set to hit theaters next year, Mattel should definitely invest in a spell check to save itself any future legal headaches, and prevent the possibility of minors stumbling upon porn. Just a thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-review.1052100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There is so much to do in Infinity Nikki – so much that it can sometimes be overwhelming. It's not long after you learn to run and jump that you're introduced to multiple in-game currencies, countless menus, and an abundance of color. Then, there are the outfits: hundreds of adorable clothing pieces, accessories, and makeup options across its beautiful fantasy world. A lot of that is inherent to the Nikki games, a dress-up gacha series that was previously mobile-only. It has the saccharine visuals, outfits ranging from the basic to the fantastical, and the trademark positivity mixed with occasional melancholy in its story. However, Infinity Nikki not only makes the jump to PC and PlayStation 5 (alongside mobile), it does so while also transitioning from the static dress-up menus of its predecessors to an impressive open world packed to the brim with varied locations to explore, countless items to collect, and charming characters to befriend. It's rare to see a series make such a huge leap, but Infinity Nikki has somehow done so with grace, landing firmly on two feet clad in a pair of sparkling heels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going back to 2012, Nikki games have always been about building out a wardrobe and dressing up the pink-haired (by default) Nikki in any way you choose. Previous entries would have you move from chapter to chapter, compete in styling contests, and gather clothes and accessories – but that was done largely by navigating 2D menus, not running around a 3D map. She’s always accompanied by her best friend and traveling companion, a brash talking cat named Momo, and there’s some dense high-fantasy lore that sometimes introduces strangely high stakes for a game about cute clothes. That’s a quaint formula designed to counteract reality by relying on hyper-girly aesthetics and the simple joy of putting on an amazing outfit and admiring it in the mirror, and while Infinity Nikki shares the same ethos, it expands it into a sandbox world that feels as vast and full as adventure games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review"><u>Genshin Impact</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Infinity Nikki Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Miraland, the fantasy world where much of the Nikki series takes place, is lush and colorful. Every element is designed to be as twee as possible. Flowers glow and NPCs greet you with enthusiasm. It rains, but it never gets gloomy. Even the enemies are designed to be unassuming, with the most threatening I've encountered in my 20+ hours being a giant walking boulder. You don't even "fight" these enemies; instead you non-violently "purify" them with a ball of energy. Nikki herself goes about her business essentially unthreatened – she can get damaged, but she'll always wake up safe and sound at the nearest fast-travel point if she runs out of health, and regenerates it quickly when out of combat. (I had to test this, because I never actually died.) If I didn't know better, I'd think every character subsists on a diet of frosting-coated ice cream cake covered in sprinkles. That's how sugary the world feels — though there are also little bits of ruin sneaking into its corners, like in the Queen's Palace at the start or the story about war and refugees that’s expertly peppered in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki's incredibly varied but usually bubbly style is most apparent in its clothing. Nikki truly looks stunning all the time, and developer Infold Games has put immense detail into every outfit. In close-ups, you can practically see each stitch and rhinestone, and when she runs or hops, the way her clothes sway looks just like real fabric. Once I unlocked the ethereal Crystal Poems outfit, which is available through gacha pulls and makes Nikki look like a winter princess, I almost never took it off. Even less premium outfits like the maid-inspired Gentle Meowmur or ability outfit Whispering Bubbles add flair to Nikki's movement. Sometimes it's worth floating down from a high platform just to watch the dress flow in the air.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Developer Infold Games has put immense detail into every outfit.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a safe bet that any Nikki game would try to make its outfits shine, but Infinity Nikki puts that same quality of cuteness everywhere else, too. For example, Miraland's various fauna are fluffy, round, and sometimes given absurd names. There are the standards here, like regular horses, but then one breed of dog looks like a pomeranian and is officially called a Floof. An unlockable ability outfit lets you gently groom these critters to collect their fluff and feathers for crafting — Nikki isn't out to skin or pluck a creature in this world. Each animal gets a short wash and their own unique, aggressively cute animation when you do; Floofs roll over for tummy rubs, while bunnies let you clean their long ears and feet. I won't lie, there were many squeals coming from my office as I played. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether this tone works for you or not will become apparent as soon as you boot up Infinity Nikki for the first time. As it compiles shaders on the main menu (which it annoyingly had to do each time I opened the PC launcher), your eyes will be bombarded by what feels like every color on the visible spectrum during a montage of moments you'll eventually encounter, and that's all before your ears pick up the flamboyantly perky original theme song by artist Jessie J. It's definitely a lot, but it's all in fitting service of a game that you can put in the dictionary alongside the word "delightful." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the Nikki games have never been one-note on this front. Infinity Nikki's theme song sounds like a typical anime opening out of Sailor Moon or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review"><u>Super Mario Odyssey's</u></a> "Jump Up, Super Star," but it's counterbalanced by music that changes as you travel throughout the world. The main score features poppy piano, but moving to the fishing area of the first town brings out a folksy guitar. The story is similarly all over the place, and one moment can have the always optimistic and soft-spoken Nikki using her outfits and styling prowess to help people with problems like taking a picture of a flower, and the next she’s dressing up like a police officer to interrogate a suspect in a vast conspiracy involving false wishes putting people into comas for some nefarious purpose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This emotional whiplash between light and dark isn't anything new for the Nikki series, but it works particularly well in Infinity Nikki because it helped make me care about a fantasy story with a tough-to-follow mythos, magic based on wishing, and plenty of proper nouns like Miracle Outfit, Heart of Purity, and Esseling to keep track of. It's also great for a laugh; I'm not sure why a town is asking a young, pink-haired girl they just met to interrogate a prisoner, but it's just absurd enough to keep me entertained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only distraction from this setup are the bugs I ran into ahead of launch. Audio cuts out over time or doesn’t come in at all, and there were a few areas where I accidentally fell through the floor and had to relaunch from the desktop. An update that rolled out during the review period even broke stylist contests so they would cause a crash instead of activating, hindering my progress after a certain point. With a game of this size, there are bound to be issues, but the important part is that none of the ones I saw took away from my overall enjoyment – your goals are so open ended and there's so much here that I always had more than enough to happily keep me busy even if I wasn't able to continue the main story.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Explore to Find the Horses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki sucks you in with a world just <em>packed</em> with things to do that reveal themselves masterfully over dozens and dozens of hours. You start off in some ruins outside the town of Florawish, where you'll quickly wander through fields collecting items for crafting before walking around the main square and chatting with various characters. Soon, you'll learn about Whimstars, special items scattered around the world that allow you to work your way through Nikki’s skill tree. Some are simply in hard-to-reach places and require you to do a little platforming, but others will be disguised as animals you need to successfully groom, blocked by enemies you must purify, or locked behind various simple but sometimes time-consuming puzzles you have to solve. And that's not even going into collecting the main currency, called Blings, purifying Dews of Inspiration that you can turn in for special outfits, or just… exploring for the sake of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki is at its best — aside from its fashion, of course — in how it lures you from the beaten path. As I’m riding my bike (yes, there is also biking!) around the map, I have to stop every five seconds to check out something in the distance. I've gotten lost purifying monsters, petting horses, exploring caves, or just finding out if that conspicuously big leaf is actually a trampoline and, if so, what I will find when I jump on it. This may look like other open-world fantasy games, but little touches like the satisfyingly floaty double jump or objects like bouncy nets let you explore in a slightly different way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With no deadlines or level gating, you're free to do whatever you want.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You could spend hours running around the starting area of Florawish or the fields and caves right outside it, but venturing elsewhere is always worth it. For example, I initially thought that the only dogs in this land were Floofs, but heading to the rival town of Stoneville introduced me to Bowlers, which are huge off-brand Saint Bernards. You'll also find different enemies that'll reward new crafting supplies, new bugs like Witzles (which you can only find in ruins and breakable crates) to catch, and, if you're interested, new lore. There's even a train-based mission that you'll only find much later on, and it’s one of the notable moments where Infinity Nikki successfully switches up the tone from upbeat to spooky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You could skip all this in-depth exploration, too (not that you should). Following just the main quests as they come in means you won't unlock things like the bicycle or find certain crafting items for a long time since they're tied to certain locations, but because Infinity Nikki is so loose with when you need to complete objectives, you could make these discoveries out of order or whenever you want. In fact, you could theoretically travel straight to the area on your map where you can rent a bike, which lets you get to new towns more easily, before you get the quest telling you to do so. There are no deadlines and nothing like the level gating of an RPG open world, so you're truly free to do whatever you want. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll even get the joy of exploration through Infinity Nikki's menus. Yes, really. The tutorials lead you through the basics, such as using your handy tablet called a Pear-Pal (get it?), but you'll discover even more over time by clicking around the menus after completing a task. That's how I realized you can upgrade Momo's camera by capturing photos of specific locations to fill up a photo book. The photo mode is initially basic, but unlocking skills in one of three trees in the camera menu gives it new features like filters and poses that make it more fun to experiment with. I was probably a dozen hours into my playthrough before I learned that (you get that pro-tip for free!) and realizing something like this can be frustrating since it feels like you've unknowingly missed out on potential boosts or rewards, but since you're never forced to do anything specific, that feeling goes away quickly. And, to its credit, this gradual rollout of features keeps Infinity Nikki fresh over a longer period of time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A Mobile Game Through and Through</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being on both PlayStation 5 and PC, Infinity Nikki is still a free-to-play mobile game at heart. And like many of its ilk, it has lots of different currencies to spend across many different menus — so much so that it can be hard to keep track of what you need for something and then where to turn it in once you get it. I often had to randomly click through multiple menus before I found the one I was actually looking for, and I'm sure that's not an uncommon experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buried within them are even more things to do, where you can obtain <em>even more</em> currencies by turning in quests or completing tasks. Unless you read their flavor text and instructions closely, you might not even know what these goals entail – you just know that doing <em>something</em> will reward you with experience, Diamonds, resources, or maybe an entirely new currency you've never encountered before. All the menus are either in your Pear-Pal or on the UI at the top of the screen, and a red dot will notify you when there's a reward to claim, so thankfully you don't actually need to know how anything works right away to make forward progress. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You're always earning <em>something </em>just by playing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, there are weekly tasks you can fulfill to get experience in Mira's Journey, which is just a fancy name for Infinity Nikki's battle pass. As in other free-to-play games, there are two levels to it: a free one that'll net you some rewards, and a premium one that'll reward you even more, including special outfits and premium currency. The Mira’s Journey available during the review period was called Distant Anthem, and it didn't feature a lot on the premium track to tempt me to buy it beyond a new cloak for Momo at level 30 and another when completing it fully. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather confusingly,<em> </em>your Mira's Journey levels are <em>not </em>the same as your Mira Level. Free-to-play mobile games are always inundating you with things like this, each with their own unique objectives and rewards, because it keeps you clicking around even when there's nothing to do. It also ensures you're always earning <em>something </em>by playing, even if it's just a couple bits of currency or, in the case of Infinity Nikki, basic crafting supplies. For example, there are Daily Wishes, where completing five out of six objectives will net you some goodies, but you'll fill them out easily enough just by playing like normal. It takes no effort on your part, and you still get a treat – and Infinity Nikki gets a few more menu clicks out of you. This isn’t a highlight of Infinity Nikki, but it is par for the course in this genre.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best open-world games to ignore the story</h3><p>Open-world games that are at their best when you wander around ignoring the main story.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, if you thought the menus were tough to keep straight, the countless currencies are even trickier. Bling is the main one and can easily be obtained either by picking up floating, glowing crystals while wandering around the world or by completing quests. Diamonds are a premium currency used to purchase special outfits or unlock Resonite Crystals, which are then used for the gacha that gets you other cosmetics. Spend a Shard and you can pull from a pool of clothing and accessories to hopefully obtain the individual pieces that make up four incredibly fantastical five-star outfits. Pulling three-star duplicates grants you 10 Tranquility Drops, which… quite frankly, took me <em>far </em>too much menu digging to even find out they were used in a "Pity" system to not punish you as much for duplicate pulls. Finally, Stellarite is purchased with real-world money and can be used to buy Diamonds and other exclusive outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There might be too many currencies, but it's all in service of Infinity Nikki's endgame: collecting as many outfits as possible, whether it's with real money or not. That means it's time to talk about the dreaded M-word: microtransactions. After a decade of perfecting the mobile Nikki gacha systems, Infold didn't have to innovate much to implement the same thing here. Infinity Nikki's microtransaction strategy simply takes advantage of your FOMO (fear of missing out): You can craft and pick up plenty of stunning, intricate outfits without ever spending a dime, but the <em>coolest </em>outfits will always either cost money or be in the gacha pool. Spending real-world money can also help you fill up your wardrobe faster – sure, you can complete a steampunk lolita outfit by turning in Dews of Inspiration, but that's time consuming. Why not just dump Diamonds into Resonite, or purchase the outfit of your dreams outright? At the time of this writing, the most expensive outfit costs 2,980 Stellarite, which is slightly less than $50. Things can quickly get out of control for your wallet if you don't "budget wisely," as the Infinity Nikki store reminds you at the top of the menu.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Plenty of stunning outfits are free, but the <em>coolest </em>ones cost money.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Importantly, none of the outfits you can win from a pack or nab with a lucky pull are required if you want to move forward in the story or exploration of Infinity Nikki. Getting a fancy outfit might make it easier to win stylist encounters, which ask you to earn the most points you can by meeting specific prompts with the clothes you wear, but those are pretty easy to succeed at without them in my experience. In Love Nikki and Shining Nikki, purchasing more elaborate clothing options or accessories could help you against other players in PvP styling competitions, but there isn’t any multiplayer here beyond leaving little photography impressions for other players to find and a friend system (although Infold could always add more down the line). It's all for you, which makes resisting the temptation to spend a little easier. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, as in any respectable free-to-play game, spending real money is not something you <em>have </em>to do in Infinity Nikki, which should allay any worries about unfairness. However, some of these outfits do still cost a lot of real-world cash if you decide to pay up, which can start to feel exploitative either way. It's also tough to say how obnoxious these systems will be in practice, as the review copy came with an unrealistically large amount of both Diamonds and Bling so that we could test out everything Infinity Nikki had to offer, but that also makes it trickier to say how this economy will fare over time. Free-to-play games often make it easy to gain premium currency in the beginning and then slow it down as you get further in, and that was always the case in the other Nikki games. But even if you don’t spend a dime, it’s easy to have at least a few dozen hours of excellent exploration and adventure for free in Infinity Nikki before you’ll even start to consider walking away.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Boss Studio says the mode asks players to deal as much damage as possible over a 20-minute period. The team says leaderboards reset every week, confirming that brackets will be added “soon.” With Tournaments also comes a Tournament Shop, which allows players to spend currency called Tournament trophies on items and new units.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/anime-last-stand-codes-roblox-1716343058489.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Anime Last Stand's Tournament update comes with a variety of quality-of-life improvements.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Two new units also arrive with the Tournament update – Pirate King (Celestial) and Soul King (Shiny) (Exotic) – as well as seven new Evolutions: Pirate Lord, Fused Warrior (Blue), Idol (Pop-Star), Flame Breather (Demonic), Noble Caption (Blood War), World’s Strongest (Prime), Kon (Rage). Some of the more substantial changes involve new features, such as seamless retry, which allows players to restart stage instantly. Evolving now increases a unit’s stats, too, with a 5% chance to increase stats twice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those quality-of-life changes, rerolling stats has been tweaked to make it harder to accidentally skip a stat you want. Boss Studio says it has also implemented “some lag fixes” while buffing out a number of other bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Roblox news, there are a variety of other popular experiences that have received updates big and small in the last few weeks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-during-naraka-fest-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Highlights include a new hero and details about upcoming collaborations.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Naraka Fest has come and gone, and we got lots of info about what’s on the horizon for Naraka: Bladepoint. There’s a new hero, collab events, and upcoming world championship, and we have all the details about everything announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most immediate bit of news relates to the collaboration with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which had been teased during the Naraka Fest Direct in June. The collab is already here — it launched on December 4 and added four characters from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Geralt, Triss, Yennefer, and Ciri are now available as skins for Tarka Ji, Cyra, Valda Cui, and Shayol Wei. During the collab, you’ll also be able to earn tokens that can be traded for in-game items.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/the-witcher-3-cover-1733273924534.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The next big reveal was the announcement of a new hero: Lannie, a wandering street performer who is skilled with traditional Chinese magic tricks. She’s a talented singer and storyteller who can perform different types of traditional Chinese folk arts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">She has a unique skill set in combat that focuses on the cloth she carries and the magic tricks she can do with it. She can repel enemies with the cloth and disappear into it, performing a vanishing act that lets her escape. Or she can jump into her cloth, dash quickly, and release a special attack that can send enemies flying. You’ll have the chance to try her out for yourself when she joins the game in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the collab with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the most imminent, Naraka Fest also announced two more future collabs. One is with The King of Fighters, the fighting game series that’s been going strong for 30 years. Classic characters from the series will join Naraka: Bladepoint in the form of new hero outfits when the collab launches in early 2025.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/1733123568069-1733274069781.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping with the brawler theme, Naraka: Bladepoint will also collab with real-life champion Buakaw Banchamek. He's regarded as one of the best Muay Thai fighters of all time, with several championships to his name. The collab will add authentic motion-captured moves from Banchamek, and players can complete missions that reward tokens which can be used to summon Banchamek in-game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/j-cup-1733274120688.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but not least, for esports fans, we got details about the upcoming J-Cup World Championship. It will return on December 14–15 in Changsha, China (December 13–14 in U.S. time zones) and will feature the top 12 Naraka: Bladepoint players from around the world facing off for the title. You’ll be able to watch the action live on Naraka: Bladepoint’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NARAKABLADEPOINT" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/narakabladepoint" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@narakabladepoint?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TikTok</u></a> channels.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

"These items are not only a tribute to Marvel's artistic legacy but also a way for us to reinterpret and capture different facets of the Marvel universe."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-characters-every-superhero-and-supervillain/2900-5216/" data-ref-id="2900-5216">Marvel Rivals' impressive roster of playable characters</a> (over 30 and counting, with more on the way) will be accessible to all players for free. Future updates adding new characters, maps, and gameplay features will be free as well, NetEase emphasized.</p><p dir="ltr">Like most shooters, Marvel Rivals will include seasonal battle passes. However, unlike most games in the genre, purchased battle passes won't expire at the end of a season. Players will instead be able to continue making progress on old battle passes after the end of a season, much like the battle pass system in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For the game's initial Season 0, the battle pass will be half the size of a standard battle pass due to the season's shorter length. It will also cost half as much to compensate. Standard battle passes will be roughly $10, with the shorter Season 0 battle pass costing around $5. The premium (or Luxury, as Marvel Rivals calls it) Season 0 battle pass will include five costumes and various other cosmetics, while the free version will grant one epic-quality costume and some other freebies.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase said other free cosmetics can be earned via achievements and various events. Units can be earned for free from completing achievements or participating in events and used to purchase cosmetics. Units are also included in the Luxury battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">The Overwatch-inspired shooter recently revealed a flurry of new characters, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-wolverine-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-the-best-there-is/2300-6465532/" data-ref-id="2300-6465532">Wolverine</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-squirrel-girl-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-the-unbeatable/2300-6465520/" data-ref-id="2300-6465520">Squirrel Girl</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-black-widow-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-super-spy-sniper/2300-6465525/" data-ref-id="2300-6465525">Black Widow</a>.

<p>IllFonic, the developers behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, have announced that its the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2024.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/IllFonic/status/1864369606988632330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, CEO and co-founder Charles Brungardt said that the layoffs are an acceptance of the “harsh reality” within the games industry.</p>



<p>“Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic,” he said. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy.”</p>







<p>In addition to developing its own games, Illfonic has provided support development for games like Crysis 3 and Star Citizen. Coincidentally enough, the latter’s developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games recently held</a> its own layoffs.</p>



<p>There was no specific mention of how many people have been let go. According to <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/illfonic/5a1da50f2300005a0097c01e#:~:text=As%20of%20October%202024%2C%20IllFonic,including%20North%20AmericaEuropeAsia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeadIQ</a>, Illfonic employed 96 people as of October 2024.</p>



<p>To close his statement, Brungardt requested that those with openings reach out to him in order to help place those who have lost their jobs.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>

It would be a shame if… newly-added furry friends… made a heckin’ mess all over the place! Alongside <em>DORONKO WANKO</em>‘s playful Pomeranian protagonist, unleash the rascal within as three new breeds are added to the mix of playable puppers. </p><p>How much will it cost to clean this up? As much as possible! Roll around in nearby puddles, tippy-tap into clean areas of the house, then shake-shake-shake to splatter muddy mayhem in every direction and rack up a six-figure housekeeping bill. Don’t worry, master could never be mad at such a cute, smol doggo, right?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Hop onto kitchen countertops, run across shelves, and into various rooms to paint a multicolored messterpiece by knocking over nearby staining liquids like tomato juice, wine, coffee, ink, and paint. Explore the entire house to find special rooms in which to wreak even more havoc prior to discovery.</p><p>Snoot-boop power buttons of nearby appliances — like robot vacuums and fans — that can fling muck even further than any floofer’s tiny toe beans could ever touch. Don dirt-spreading wearables like miniature mess cannons and sludge-spouting whales to dishevel rooms at a devious pace. Pick up misplaced items like mugs and toys, then return them to the right spot to solve bamboozling puzzles that unlock special gifts. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After a nearly 10-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> finally arrived at the end of October. While the previous game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, is now regarded as a classic in the genre, The Veilguard's reception has been considerably colder from some. That's something that the developers behind The Veilguard have already come to terms with.</p><p>"It's been a decade since the last Dragon Age game came out, and a lot of people have spent that decade imagining various versions of what this game was going to be," said Dragon Age creative director John Epler during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "The reality was whatever we came out with, it was never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations."</p><p>The long development of The Veilguard included a period where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">the sequel was re-envisioned as a live-service game</a> before it transitioned back to a single-player experience. Given everything that went into the game, director Corinne Busche shared her satisfaction with The Veilguard in its final form.</p><p>"We're very happy with the critical reception to the game," said Busche. "It's not common to have these challenging development cycles and have a team turn around and receive the critical reception that it did. In fact, in a lot of ways, that is the harder path to take. So yeah, we're quite proud of the critical reception. Unfortunately on the sales side, that's not something we can really discuss. but of course as we know with Inquisition, that was a long burn to get to those total sales numbers."</p><p>EA has already stated that The Veilguard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">won't be getting a DLC expansion</a> because BioWare is shifting gears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">the next Mass Effect game</a>. However, Busche expressed confidence in the future of the Dragon Age franchise.</p><p>"There's so many stories left, so many mysteries left unsolved, so I'll leave that for what it is," related Busche. "I will remain of the point of view that [Dragon Age's ability to reinvent itself] remains our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity."</p>

future, but the team decided it was best to stick to the 2024 release date. The decision was influenced in part by the sheer level of exhaustion experienced by the game's developers, who endured multiple "marathon" crunch sessions to make sure the game was the best it could be, without resorting to another delay.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's very hard to explain your [mental] state when you're in a very intensive work process for many months until release, and you're working over, over, over what you usually can do, and [you're doing it] in the highest possible stress and overwhelming period," Grygorovych said of the race to finish the game while dealing with the constant strife of the ongoing war in Ukraine, where GSC was originally headquartered.</p><p dir="ltr">He added that he was surprised to see how much of Stalker 2's media coverage glossed over the fact that it was made in the midst of war, but instead focused more on standard details like patch notes, as if nothing were happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something so unimportant in the scale of the country, but they were talking about the game!" he said of the coverage.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2's development was heavily impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. GSC offices were damaged by a fire caused by Russian shelling, and the dev team ultimately had to make the difficult decision to leave their homes in Ukraine to finish work on the sequel to their most iconic title.</p><p dir="ltr">The war's impact can even be seen in the title of the game--while the original Stalker used the Russian spelling of the title (Shadow of Chernobyl), Stalker 2 has changed the spelling to reflect the Ukrainian pronunciation of Chornobyl. The devs even created a documentary about the struggle to develop a game set one's home country when that country is being ravaged by war.</p><p dir="ltr">Early in the invasion, Russian forces even occupied Pripyat--the city in which Stalker and Stalker 2 are set--and defaced the nuclear accident site along with the surrounding area. The city of Pripyat is now back under Ukrainian control, but the <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?si=RE4PKuM3PZwi8kjd" rel="nofollow ">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> documentary gives viewers a closer look at the difficulties, complications, and heartbreaks they dealt with during the game's development cycle. Gyrgorovych says half of the development team moved to Prague, while the other half remained in Kyiv. Employee safety was (and remains) a constant concern, and GSC devs yearn for the country they spent so long making games about.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796"></a><figcaption>At one point Russian forces invaded the radioactive city in which the Stalker series is set.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very important to remind people what's going on [in Ukraine], because when there is something evil and you stop calling it out and mentioning it... it won't help to stop it," Gyrgorovych said. "One layer is we are making the game, and we want to entertain people and make it as good a game as possible. And second, it's about what we can do for our homeland, because we are in a hard situation. I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</p><p dir="ltr">Although Grygorovych was a bit surprised by the media's failure to acknowledge the cultural context of the game's creation, his wife Mariia--who also works at the studio--was delighted by the response from players in their home country. Ukrainian players signed into the game en masse after its release, leading to nationwide internet outages in the hours after its release.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a bad thing because the internet is important, but at the same time it's like, 'Whoa!'" Marii said of the response from Ukrainian players. "It touched everyone in the country."</p><p dir="ltr">"For us and our team what's most important is, for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier [now] than they were before [the game's] release," she added. "We did something for our home country, something good for them.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems. But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems--you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p>

		<p>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls has been given a release date of March 21st, Bandai Namco has announced. It will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. The game was first announced in July, with confirmation that BLEACH Rebirth of Souls would contain a brand new story, instead of adapting an established plot instead. A new trailer has been released to mark the March 21st date, and it features Aizen and Yamamoto. These are two more playable characters of the game.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, the more dire the circumstances, the greater character’s power can grow. In the middle of each conflict, the momentum can shift as characters can unleash powerful attacks the closer they get to being defeated. This state reveals new shapes and swords to allow&nbsp; players to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>Three versions of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls are now available to pre-order too. The standard edition is just the game, and will cost £54.99. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, and soul crystal set 2, which is used to upgrade player abilities. This edition will cost £79.99. The Digital Ultimate edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, soul crystal 2 and 3, Thousand-Year Blood War Costume Set and Rebirth of Souls Costume Set. This edition will cost £94.99. Those who pre-order also get the Toshiro and Yoruichi Thousand-Year Blood War costume sets.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Bleach game we appeared to have reviewed was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección</a>, way back in 2011. At the time, Dan said,<em>&nbsp;“The story also hasn’t been handled particularly well. Having just a wall of text at the start of a level is actually quite deflating, and rather than pumping up the player for a bit of carnage it has the opposite effect. If the story had been fleshed out then the score would have been a fair bit higher. Overall it’s a fun game, but also a real missed opportunity.”</em></p>

		<p>Gran Turismo has been a monolith of racing for PlayStation fans over the past three decades, and so to mark its importance, Sony and Polyphony Digital have put together a new free-to-play experience dubbed My First Gran Turismo.</p>
<p>My First Gran Turismo will be available for free across both PS5 and PS4 via the PlayStation Store on 6th December at midnight local time.</p>
<p><iframe title="My First Gran Turismo Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xXXU7LlrfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aim with this game is to pay homage to the very first entry in the series, appreciating it through the modern game engine of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. Still, it’s designed to be “approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level,” series creator Kazunori Yamauchi explains.</p>
<p>The game will include three races, three time trials and three Music Rally stages, as well as a suite of License Tests to complete. 18 cars are included, and the trio of tracks are&nbsp;Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit.</p>

<p>In a nice bonus, My First Gran Turismo also has full <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> support via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a nice homage to the franchise history, though this looks like it’s effectively just a demo for Gran Turismo 7. That’s no bad thing, of course, and having even a small slice of GT7 racing available for anyone and everyone to check out on PS4 and PS5 is pretty great in our books.</p>

		<p>Warhorse Studios has one of those weird and slightly unsettling announcements for gamers to contemplate: they’ve brought the release of their next game… forward? That’s right, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is now releasing one week earlier on 4th February 2025. Surprise!</p>
<p>The announcement comes a day before the debut of a new story trailer at the PC Gamer Show tomorrow, 5th December, as the game is nominated as one of most anticipated games of next year. At the same time the PC</p>


<p>There’s further good news, though. The game has now gone Gold, which used to mean that a game was all done and dusted and ready for release – these days it means that it’s ready to get something put on discs for consoles, while the devs continue to hurriedly squash bugs for a day one patch. Still, it’s a great milestone and allows Warhorse to make some further announcements and reveals.</p>
<p>One of these things is a confirmation of the PC specs and requirements, which will come tomorrow, where they will also reveal the performance that they’re able to get out of consoles. One little tidbit is that the game will have a 60fps mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and it will also be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro Enhanced</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Hands on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 –&nbsp;Henry and Hans go to the big city</a></h2>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier this year, exploring the opening in the gorgeous countryside of Bohemia (with some not-so-gorgeous narrative twists for Henry and Sir Hans), before leaping ahead to the big city of Kutenberg.</p>

<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a real showcase for how much Warhorse Studios has grown, evolving their take on the historical setting and their approach to role playing games in general.”</p>
