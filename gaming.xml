In the case of the D&amp;D CRPG, it’s a natural extension of playing dungeon master around the table, crafting the world and its characters as you see fit - typically by making everyone in Faerûn even hornier somehow.</p>

<p>There are no end of Baldur’s Gate 3 mods to find out there to satisfy your every desire to tweak the game’s visuals, gameplay and more - or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-sort-of-turns-it-into-dragon-age-origins">even make it an entirely different game altogether</a>. To date, those mods have been crafted by enterprising creators finding their own way to play around with the game’s files, but developers Larian plan to throw open the doors so that anyone can create a killer salami sword and mess around with your party’s fashion choices.</p>
<p>Official mod support will come to Baldur’s Gate 3 in September, the studio announced, expanding the existing (but unofficial) implementation of third-party mods with proper support that aims to smooth out the risks of instability or incompatibility. Larian are quick to reassure that their official mod.io platform won’t replace support for other third-party mods - for example, those that use more complex scripts, veer too far away from the game’s official D&amp;D licence or, ahem, are too NSFW to pass official moderation - but will sit alongside the manual approach as a more user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>“We understand and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the modding community, and have no plans to limit modding to our official pipeline,” Larian wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452">their blog post</a> detailing the plans. “We are committed to supporting the modding community as comprehensively as we can, and can’t wait to see what ideas you bring to life!”</p>

<p>The incoming toolkit will include a dedicated mod editor, level tester and in-game mod browser, built on the studio’s own development tools to allow creators to mess around with things like textures and models. (The official mod platform also means PC-made mods should then be usable on console.)</p>
<p>While the mod tools will roll out to everyone later this year, Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 7 is already being tested with a small set of mod makers in a limited alpha test ahead of the wider release. In July, that test pool will be expanded again with a closed beta open to anyone via 1,000 additional sign-up spots.</p>
<p>As well as the mod tools, Larian teased that they’re working on a photo mode, crossplay and additional fixes for future updates, along with some “anniversary extravagance” to mark a year since the game’s full release in August.</p>

					<p>MultiVersus has got to be the textbook example of how even the most recognizable properties don't guarantee the success of a live service game. Launched in open beta back in July 2022, complete with microtransactions, the platform fighter developed by Player First Game was abruptly&nbsp;taken down <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-open-beta-to-end-on-june-25-game-to-launch-better-than-ever-in-early-2024/">the following year</a>. While the dwindling number of players since launch may have played a part in taking the game offline, the developer assured that MultiVersus would be coming back in 2024 better than ever with a lot of changes based on player feedback.</p>
<p>MultiVersus is now back online and apparently out of beta, but I'm having a hard time considering this version of the game as the first, proper 1.0 version. Rather, it feels like this is a beta version of another vision for the platform fighter, a vision where, sadly, the bad currently outweighs the good.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240530131752_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At its heart, the latest version of MultiVersus is not that different from the game we played in 2022 and 2023. Taking more than a few pages from the Super Smash Bros. series' book, the game is a platform fighter where players must knock out of a stage their opponents with a focus on 2 versus 2 gameplay and a diverse roster of characters lifted from Warner Bros. properties. Stages are as varied as the playable cast, inspired by iconic locations such as the Batcave, the Red Keep's throne room from Game of Thrones, and many others.</p>
<p>Once again, the diverse roster of characters and stages are the highlights of the experience, thanks to their excellent design. Characters, for example, are quite varied, and their movesets take full advantage of their unique quirks. Tom and Jerry are very technical fighters who can put together some nasty setups, and Batman can use some of his most iconic gadgets to control the flow of battle. Some of the new additions to the roster over the beta, like the Joker, Jason from Friday the 13th, and Banana Guard from Adventure Time, are just as well designed as the previously released cast, their movesets full of references that the most hardcore fans won't fail to recognize.</p>
<p>With the exception of Support characters, who were reworked into the other classes, the characters from the beta play pretty much the same, retaining most of their moveset. Despite this, the game did not feel natural at first due to some big gameplay changes, such as the much slower pace of combat. This change was clearly made to improve screen readability and prevent games from becoming a chaotic mess like they often did in the beta, but I cannot help but feel that slowing things down this much wasn't a great decision. With a slower speed, combat should have felt weightier, but this isn't the case here, mostly due to the animations and a certain "stickiness" that makes them feel really slow. The general floatiness that put me off in the beta wasn't addressed at all, making air combat feel so unsatisfying compared to the Smash series. Thankfully, damage over 100 points greatly increases knockback, making it much easier to score knockouts over the beta, where I felt games dragged on too much, especially in 1v1.</p>
<p>Another element of the combat that really put me off in the beta, the Perks, which grant characters a variety of bonuses, have been slightly reworked, and although they don't feel that crucial anymore, I still think they should be disabled in any sort of competitive mode. As online play is currently limited to casual matchmaking, hopefully, Player First Games will do away with them in ranked mode, although I am not too hopeful since it wasn't the case in the beta. The zoomed-in camera is another change over the beta I would have happily done without, as it doesn't provide a very good view of the stage. The colored outlines, on the other, do feel distracting but they are definitely helpful in team matches to easily keep track of your companion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240530132436_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gameplay changes, however, are not the reason I feel MultiVersus is still in beta. Over the previous version, the current one lacks some essential features, such as no leaderboards, no after-battle report, advanced tutorials in training mode, the inability to change controller settings in the training room, and more. The worst offender, however, has got to be the inability to try out characters that haven't been purchased in training mode and local play. This seems like a major oversight, considering that every character costs the same amount of Gleamium and Fighter Currency. The latter can be obtained, albeit slowly, by playing the game, but the player should still be allowed to try out a character before purchasing, given the money and time investment.</p>
<p>The multiple currencies, which also include Perk Currency to unlock Perks and Prestige Currency used to unlock rare cosmetics, are only a small part of the free-to-play trappings that suck the joy out of MultiVersus. There isn't a single time you aren't constantly reminded of the multiple currencies, Missions, Battle Passes, and microtransactions, and I can't help but find this extremely offputting. The convoluted main menu doesn't exactly help either, having been designed more to accommodate these constant "reminders" than to feel functional, in my opinion. Making matters worse is how the free-to-play mechanics don't feel fair at all. Battle Pass experience, for example, is only obtained after completing Missions, so progression stops after clearing all of the available ones. To make another example, you need to master around 10 different characters to obtain enough Fighter Currency to purchase one character, not counting any currency obtained by completing Missions.</p>
<p>Alongside the gameplay changes and new additions to the roster, the latest version of MultiVersus introduces Rifts, a single-player mode that features a variety of different combat scenarios and mini-games, as well as different difficulty levels to put your skills to the test. These Rifts, unfortunately, are not particularly engaging, as the skeleton of a story they feature isn't particularly great, and the combat scenarios and minigames tend to become stale fast. Hopefully, future Rifts will address these issues and become a fun side activity to participate in when one's not in the mood for online matches.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240531123733_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned above, MultiVersus only features casual matchmaking for 1v1 and 2v2 at the time of writing. Without skill-based matchmaking, players of all skill levels are getting matched together, which doesn't always translate into a good experience. The game's rollback netcode is not the best either, as there's some noticeable input delay even when the action appears smooth. Servers, sadly, are still under pressure, so having a smooth match is an exception as of now. Wi-Fi and rollback frame indicators would have improved the online experience, especially in 2v2, as a bad internet connection is obviously more impactful than in 1v1.</p>

<p>Given how MultiVersus has only just been released, and things will obviously get tweaked in the future, it is difficult to score the game in its current state. While the free-to-play trappings are unlikely to change, tweaks and additional content could deeply improve the experience in the long term, making it a worthy rival to Super Smash Bros. and other popular platform fighting games. As of now, however, I feel much of the potential of MultiVersus is still untapped, and it will be up to Player First Game to let the seed they have planted bloom.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Concord Editions Revealed on PlayStation Store]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-editions-preorder/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Concord was revealed just a few days ago at the State of Play showcase, and gamers worldwide immediately found issues with the ‘hero-shooter fatigue’ that’s running rampant. In a nutshell, Concord looks like a cross between Overwatch and Guardians of the Galaxy, and the five-vs-five multiplayer-based operating system probably won’t move mountains anytime soon.</p>



<p>Recently, the editions of Concord available to pre-order surfaced on the PlayStation store, showcasing the bonuses you’ll receive for securing the highest edition of this upcoming shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-it-enough">Is It Enough?</h2>



<p>Concord has been in development for quite some time. It’s the debut title from Firewalk Studios, and for years, prospective fans didn’t know what to expect from the project. Now that it has been revealed in full, we know exactly what it’ll look like – but the game has proven to be divisive thus far.</p>



<p>There are two editions of the game available for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/concept/10002695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pre-order on the PlayStation store</a>: Standard and Digital Deluxe. </p>



<p>If you opt for the standard game, all you’ll get is just that – <strong>the game</strong>. Presently, it’s sitting with a price tag of $59.95, which is to be expected. However, gamers interested in picking up a little more bang for their buck can secure the Digital Deluxe Edition for $94.95, which comes with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Full Base Game</li>



<li>16 Character Skins</li>



<li>72-Hours Early Access</li>



<li>‘Monarch’ Pack</li>
</ul>



<p>It was also referenced that all pre-orders will get access to the game’s beta, which goes live in July, just a few weeks before the full game is released toward the end of August.</p>

<p>The claims come from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">Dealabs’ Billbil-kun</a>, who has accurately reported similar news around PlayStation PC ports in the past - including the news of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-quarry-devs-horror-hit-until-dawn-is-reportedly-the-next-playstation-exclusive-headed-to-pc">the Until Dawn PC release</a>. According to the reliable leaker, a PC version of The Last of Us 2 has been in the works since at least 2021 - and, most intriguingly, reportedly finished development in last November or earlier.</p>
<p>While there’s no word on whether a Last of Us 2 release on PC would be based on the remaster of the former PS4 exclusive, it seems extremely likely. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-1">The Last of Us Part I</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-resurrects-on-pc-on-march-3rd-2023">arrived on PC in March of last year</a>, six months after its own remastered re-release of the game formerly known as just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> on PS5. That remaster tuned up gameplay elements such as AI and improved visuals for things like lighting, along with adding brand new modes for speedrunning and permadeath. That said, the gap between Part 2’s original release and its remaster was notably shorter, so the leaps in visual improvements and such were a bit less drastic.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/last-of-us-2-remastered-abby-alley.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony/Naughty Dog</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Last of Us Part II’s own remaster came to PS5 at the start of this year - meaning that the wait on a PC release may be down to giving the console version a bit of breathing room, hence the wait despite development supposedly being wrapped. Billbil-kun suggested that Part 2’s PC release might not arrive all the way until next year, launching alongside the second season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-makes-history-as-the-first-live-action-video-game-adaptation-nominated-for-major-awards">acclaimed live-action HBO adaptation</a> - which will adapt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forget-two-seasons-the-last-of-us-tv-show-co-creator-wants-at-least-three">at least part of</a> the sequel’s fairly brutal story.</p>
<p>With no official word from Sony just yet - and no sign of The Last of Us during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">their latest State of Play</a> showcase - we’ll have to wait and see for now. With so many PlayStation exclusives finding their way to PC, it seems a given that The Last of Us 2 will cross over at some point. Expect to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-login-requirement-will-stop-you-playing-multiplayer-on-steam-deck">need to sign in with a PlayStation account</a> when it does, mind.</p>

			<p>With Starfield, Bethesda Game Studios produced its first science fiction IP and decided to make a game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-gameplay-revealed-xbox-and-bethesda-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a thousand explorable planets</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-has-100-planets-10-of-total-with-life-on-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 of which with life on them</a>) to sell the idea of a proper space adventure.</p>
<p>To do so, the developers of Starfield had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensively employ procedural generation</a>, which Bethesda had used in some capacity ever since Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. That game featured over fifteen thousand cities, villages, towns, and dungeons, with a playable area estimated at around 161 thousand square kilometers (real-life Great Britain is 209K square kilometers).</p>
<p>Some of the developers behind Daggerfall are now making a spiritual successor called The Wayward Realms, currently on a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter campaign</a> for funding ahead of an early access debut slated in 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a recent interview with Wccftech</a>, the developers at OnceLost Games shared their belief that Starfield would have benefited from sticking more closely to the Daggerfall procedural generation formula, especially for dungeons.</p>
<p><em>Starfield was enjoyable but took a different approach to procedural generation from ours. We feel it would have benefited from having some Daggerfall-esque “dungeon” generation instead of reusing premade dungeons.</em></p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A, the developers of The Wayward Realms also explained how they plan to advance procedural generation in their game, which will not feature a traditional main quest.</p>
<p><em>We feel that there are plenty of ways to advance the procedural generation and integrate more memorable interactions and encounters within it.</em><br>
<em>We are also taking advantage of procedural generation in order to be able to change things within the world, such as a town being burned down to the ground as a result of the political struggle.</em></p>
<p><em>The VGM is meant to work like a real life tabletop game master would, tailoring the game around the player, who/what they are playing as, and what they enjoy doing. For instance, a player who collects books may be offered more quests with books as a reward to entice them. Meanwhile, a melee-focused player may be offered more challenges based on their melee skills. The idea is to track what the player is doing and avoid offering more of what the player is not doing.</em></p>
<p><em>The VGM is also in charge of creating new quests for players, taking into account recent events, NPCs that the player has interacted with, and what factions the player is allied with and against in order to fill in the variables in potential quests. This helps make the game more relevant to the player in each playthrough.</em></p>
<p><em>There is no main quest, but we do have major World Events that occur throughout a playthrough. They act as sort of an overarching narrative. There are also questlines for each of the major factions. With both of these there will be a sort of finality to a narrative for players, but they can continue to play one beyond them, and the VGM will continue to create new adventures for the player to experience</em>.</p>
<p>Do you agree with OnceLost that Starfield should have stuck to the Daggerfall formula when making procedurally generated dungeons? Let us know below.</p>

<p>I want more of The Last of Us. I realize the second game brought about controversy, but the first game, specifically the story between Ellie and Joel, remains one of my most cherished gaming memories. I’m open to the sequel on PC. But when is The Last of Us Part 2 coming to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-release-date">Do We Know The Last of Us Part 2 PC Release Date?</h2>



<p>According to recent claims, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-port-under-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>, the PC port of The Last of Us Part 2 is under development and began sometime in 2021. Allegedly, the game’s development concluded in November 23, meaning PlayStation is sitting on the port until it’s ready for a launch.</p>



<p>Seeing as we saw nothing about the project at State of Play, there’s a chance they’re withholding the sequel’s PC port until the next season of the television series. If that’s the case, it may be another year before we see The Last of Us Part 2 on PC.</p>



<p>We don’t have a release date for The Last of Us Part 2 on PC yet. When we do, we’ll update this article to ensure you know as soon as possible!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-last-of-us-part-3-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is The Last of Us Part 3 Release Date?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">What About The Last of Us Season 2?</h2>



<p>There was supposedly a delay to the upcoming The Last of Us season two following the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike. However, we know about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-two-casting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous casting choices</a> made for the second season of the live-action adaptation. These casting choices include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kaitlyn Dever (Abby)</li>



<li>Isabela Merced (Dina)</li>



<li>Danny Ramirez (Manny)</li>



<li>Ariela Barer (Mel)</li>



<li>Tati Gabrielle (Nora)</li>



<li>Spencer Lord (Owen)</li>
</ul>



<p>Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay will reprise their roles as Joel and Ellie, respectively, for the series’ second season.</p>

Movie.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of all the developers, Nintendo may have found the most ideal Hollywood relationship. Compared to other companies, it’s more deliberate with what gets adapted and how, mainly because of the trauma of the near-universally panned 1993 Mario movie. But it ended up working out in the long run. Two Mario games came out in 2023, and neither were made in relation to the then-upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. Because Nintendo was so involved during its production, the movie works as “just another Mario game” instead of something the entire franchise is dependent on. That same feeling may extend to the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie: if a game (new or remake) comes out in the same relative proximity, it’ll feel like a natural intersection instead of predetermined steering.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through the ever-growing Pokemon anime series and movies, Nintendo practically created transmedia as we now know it. The often annual games serve as the foundation for the trading card game and anime, all of which have spent decades as pop culture fixtures. A child will watch the show, which makes them want to buy cards (hopefully before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/van-gogh-museums-event-gets-gatecrashed-by-pokemon-tcg-scalpers-in-a-prime-example-of-why-we-cant-have-nice-things/">scalpers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> take that chance from them) or the newest game, or whichever order of operations you wish to apply. That kind of cultural cache can’t be engineered in the way corporations often want it to, and it further helps that Nintendo just has a game for any occasion to be released whenever it so chooses.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers like Sony and Microsoft would very much like their games to become big transmedia enterprises, where games become movies that lead to more sales and further franchising. A lot of these would-be franchises are growing from double and triple-A games, the latter of which have become more costly to make. Movies are no stranger to high budgets, but games have started to really feel that strain, and not every one of them can get away with a remaster or PC port ahead of a silver screen adaptation. In other instances, a game project meant to build off an adaptation’s momentum may just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firesprite-s-twisted-metal-game-among-canceled-playstation-projects">get the ax</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for reasons out of its developer’s control. Abrupt studio closures or layoffs can be as game-changing as growing a game out into a multimedia juggernaut in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games and Hollywood have had a relationship for decades, but the new advent of adaptations is showing how one-sided this has become. The former has bent itself into a pretzel readying itself for adaptation, but that isn’t always going to work. Audiences for both have become adept at spotting when companies are steering media to a particular end goal, and will sometimes refuse to play along. Ensuring a healthy dynamic between the two mediums going forward will mean being less obvious in IP strategizing, as Nintendo has done. Having a direct hand in adaptations is important, but it's equally key to know when to ease off the throttle and let things play out organically.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

<p data-characters="149" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Iker Muniain End of an Era SBC is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team, and you can obtain a special card of the Bilbao star to add to your squad. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">EA Sports has been on top with regular releases of Flashback and End of an Era cards as part of the Ultimate TOTS celebrations. While few of the earlier releases have been expensive, the latest entrant is pretty cheap. This makes tonight’s SBC a perfect one for beginners to complete. </p> <h2 id="h-all-ea-fc-24-iker-muniain-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">All EA FC 24 Iker Muniain End of an Era SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Tonight’s challenge has only one task, but there are certain conditions which would have to be satisfied during squad submission. The solo squad means that you’ll need just eleven fodder items, which shouldn’t be a problem. </p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Iker Muniain</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="147" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players from: Spain</li> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min.

Opting for the cheapest solutions will help you complete other SBCs like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-nacho-fernandez-flashback-sbc-solutions/">Nacho Flashback</a>. </p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Iker Muniain</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"> <li>Fabinho 84</li> <li>Gabriel Megalhaes 84</li> <li>Dani Parejo 86</li> <li>Gregor Kobel 87</li> <li>Niklas Sule 84</li> <li>Ewa Pajor 87</li> <li>Thomas Muller 84</li> <li>Luka Modric 87</li> <li>Romelu Lukaku 84</li> <li>Leroy Sane 84</li> <li>Emma Koivisto TOTW 87</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">After completing the SBC, you’ll unlock a 94-rated CAM item, which can also operate at LM and LW. In terms of value, the Muniain End of an Era challenge is worth it. The card has good in-game stats, and the ability to play in various positions. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="false">However, the new End of an Era card has 4* Skills and 4* Weak Foot, which can be problematic in the current meta of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-maintenance-when-will-the-servers-come-back/">EA FC 24</a></em>. As I said, tonight’s SBC is more suited for relative beginners who are still building their squads. </p>

It appears that the Euro cards will be part of the next promo, which will have two sets of special cards.

Unlike previous promos in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-anthony-martial-flashback-sbc-solutions/"><em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team</a>, Path to Glory will be all about national team superstars. </p>

These superstars, once rampaging forces for their nations, will aim to leave their footprints on the <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team community. With the potential for upgrades, these Heroes and Icons could have incredible demand in the market. </p>

Global Loans and Time Loans will be pretty different from Match Loans. These loan items can be used indefinite times until they reach their expiry dates and time. All global loans will expire on July 18, so the community could have more than 1 month with these items. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-pulls-cast-of-mall-employees-into-vhs-to-live<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/">Dropout </a>has released the first trailer for the new season of <em>Dimension 20: Never Stop Blowing Up</em>. The new season of the hit anthology TTRPG show will begin airing on June 26th, 2024. With only a few weeks until viewers are invited into the adrenaline-fueled world of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> we have a chance to learn more about the setting and who is playing in the dome.</p>

<p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> follows the story of "six down-on-their-luck strip-mall employees [who]&nbsp;are sucked into a magic VHS tape, transforming into high-octane action heroes." Once inside the action movie, it's up to these characters to find their way through the movie to ultimately escape and get home.</p>

<p>Check out the full trailer below:</p>


<p>The players on this season of Dimension 20 are listed below first by the name of their 'real world' character and then by the action star that they become once they're inside the VHS.</p>

<ul><li>Jacob Wysocki as Andy 'Dang' Litefoot /&nbsp;Greg Stocks</li>
	<li>Ify Nwadiwe as Wendell Morris / Vic Ethanol</li>
	<li>Ally Beardsley as Russell Feeld / Jennifer Drips</li>
	<li>Alex Song-Xia as Liv Skyler / Kingskin</li>
	<li>Isabella Roland as Paula Donvalson (neé Buocadifuoco) / Jack Manhattan</li>
	<li>Rekha Shankar as Usha Rao / G-13</li>
	<li>Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM</li>
</ul><p>The trailer begins with DM Brennan Lee Mulligan describing scenes from a movie where a motorcycle-riding action star is wielding a katana attached to a chain. After a VHS for the movie <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> is placed before the players they're pulled into the action themselves. Throughout the trailer you can see Lee Mulligan's attire get more torn and dirtied as he morphs into a John Mcclane look-alike from <em>Die Hard</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is the craziest you've ever been at this table" Ally Beardsley to GM Brennan Lee Mulligan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a montage of character introductions, we meet the different action archetypes; rugged fighters, femme fatales, '<em>Fast and Furious</em>' style speed demons, gentlemen spies, and more.</p>



<p><em>Dimension 20: Never Stop Blowing Up</em> will be a 10-episode season beginning to air on June 26th, 2024 on Dropout. At the moment the game system in use for Never Stop Blowing Up is not explicitly clear, we have reached out to Dropout for clarification.</p>

<p>This season is coming hot off the heels of Fantasy High: Junior Year.

            <p>We knew a PC adapter for PlayStation’s VR2 headset <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-officially-working-on-pc-game-support-for-the-ps-vr2-headset">was on the way</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certification-surfaces-marking-one-more-step-towards-official-support-in-2024">it looked to be fairly soon</a> - and we were right! Sony’s shiniest virtual reality offering is now confirmed to be adding official PC support via a nifty wired adapter at the start of August. It’ll cost £50/$60 - but whether it’s worth the price given a number of key features will be missing is another question entirely...</p>

<p>On the good news side of things, the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will support SteamVR out of the box when it releases on August 7th, meaning you’ll be able to hook it up and play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-games">virtual reality games</a> on Steam - including Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>. To do that, you’ll just need to hook up the headset to your PC using the adapter and a DisplayPort 1.4 cable, then run both SteamVR and the new PlayStation VR2 app, which will let you tweak around with settings for things like play area.</p>
<p>That’s great news, especially as the VR2 is a very comfortable headset by all accounts and puts some lovely 120Hz 4K (2000x2040) OLED displays in front of your eyes across a 110-degree field of view.</p>
<p>What’s not so great is that many of the features that arguably make the VR2 a strong contender for one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-headset">best VR headsets</a> overall won’t be supported on PC, even when using the official adapter. Notably, those panels, crisp as they are, won’t support HDR on PC, and the VR2’s impressive eye-tracking won’t work either - though foveated rendering without using eye-tracking will still function. Headset feedback also won’t function, nor will the handheld controllers’ DualSense-based adaptive triggers or haptic feedback beyond simple rumble.</p>

<p>That leaves the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">list of working features</a> at the panels themselves, the headset’s see-through view - handy in case you’re about to bump into something - and the controllers’ finger-touch detection, along with 3D Audio in some games - albeit using SteamVR’s audio tech rather than the PS5-only Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p>
<p>If you’ve already got a VR2, being able to play VR games on PC without having to cough up for a whole new headset seems a no-brainer. If you’re weighing this up against other PC offerings such as the Meta Quest 3, though - which is already cheaper than the base VR2, and almost on par feature-wise due to these limitations - the combined cost of the VR2 itself the adapter certainly makes this a harder sell, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Still, the VR2 apparently hasn’t exactly set the world on fire since it came out a couple of years ago, so it might be you’re able to grab one for a steal and make the most of its nice hardware - even if some of its promising potential goes unrealised on PC.</p>

  <p id="V5Q0iB"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23889773/dropout-anniversary-collegehumor-brennan-lee-mulligan-sam-reich">Dropout</a> released a first trailer for “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164051/best-new-tv-summer-2024-release-calendar-schedule-shows-series">Never Stop Blowing Up</a>” on Wednesday, lifting the curtain on the next season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23883220/dimension-20-dropout-tv-show-anniversary-season-dnd"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>. </p>
<p id="rsqRoj">Hosted by founding game master Brennan Lee Mulligan in a series of increasingly incinerated outfits, “Never Stop Blowing Up” will follow six strip-mall employees played by Jacob Wysocki, Ify Nwadiwe, Ally Beardsley, Alex Song-Xia, Isabella Roland, and Rekha Shankar — but it sounds like they won’t be strip-mall losers for very long. </p>
<p id="vsh9bH">Our heroes find themselves “sucked into a magic VHS tape, transforming into high-octane action heroes - and must figure out how to navigate the movie to get home,” according to Dropout’s news release. </p>
<p id="O1aJFv">The trailer makes clear that those action heroes are drawn from a specific mold, echoing the likes of John McClane, Rambo, Dominic Toretto, and more. There also appears to be some kind of prop mechanic going on? With items like a dynamite bomb, a deck of cards, a bundle of “cocaine,” or a pack of cigarettes rotating around the table. </p>
<p id="Mqmv16">Fans will have to wait a few weeks to unravel those mysteries, however. “Never Stop Blowing Up” premieres on June 26 on Dropout TV, and run for 10 episodes. </p>

<p>While countless upcoming games have us in a perpetual state of excitement for this summer, few compare to the hype surrounding Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree. The first and only expansion for FromSoftware’s monolithic action game, thankfully, won’t require our entire SSD to play. Here’s the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree file size to help you prepare!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-shadow-of-the-erdtree-download">How Big is the Shadow of the Erdtree Download?</h2>



<p>To fully download and install Shadow of the Erdtree, you must have <strong>approximately 16GB of free space on an SSD</strong>. For comparison, Elden Ring requires 45GB for just the base game. In total, you’ll need ~61GB of free space for the main game and its DLC. </p>



<p>Overall, considering just how many hours you can squeeze out of the game, that’s seriously good value for the space requirements. We’re witnessing countless video games balloon in size, with Call of Duty and Destiny 2 proving to be the biggest offenders, requiring hundreds of GB of free space on your drive. It’s nice to have such a high-quality product that doesn’t eat space like candy.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-prepare-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree">How to Prepare for Shadow of the Erdtree</h2>



<ul>
<li>Take some time to track down key resources and materials, such as <strong>Smithing</strong> <strong>Stones</strong>, <strong>Bell Bearings</strong>, <strong>Grave Glovewort</strong>, and <strong>Ghost</strong> <strong>Glovewort</strong>. These upgrade materials allow you to improve your weapons and spirit ashes significantly before the difficulty spike in Shadow of the Erdtree.</li>



<li>You must <strong>defeat Mohg </strong>to access Shadow of the Erdtree. He’s weak to <strong>Bleed</strong>, <strong>Physical, </strong>and <strong>Poison Damage</strong>, so prioritize dishing those out during his boss fight to make quick work of the monstrosity.</li>



<li>While the DLC recommends you level to somewhere between <strong>100 and 150</strong>, if you can defeat Mohg at a lower level, then you should be okay to access the new zone. If you want to feel safe and endure less of a challenge overall, level to 150 beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<p data-characters="166" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After lighting the Premier League on fire in his first season with Chelsea, <em>EA FC 24</em> is introducing Cole Palmer’s signature ‘ice cold’ celebration. </p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">EA posted a video on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@easportsfc/video/7376949627825786144?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> confirming that Cole Palmer’s celebration will be added to <em>EA FC 24</em> on June 6. If you thought opponents who did the<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> griddy</a> after scoring were annoying, wait until they rub their arms after scoring a 90th-minute winner. Palmer finished second in the Premier League Golden Boot race with 22 goals and contributed 11 assists in 2024. The breakout season earned the 22-year-old a spot on England’s provisional Euros squad, and he’s expected to play a significant role in the tournament. </p>
 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">The celebration started after Palmer began his goal-scoring streak, earning the nickname Cold Palmer. From there the Chelsea player embraced the name and started rubbing his arms after goals as if he was cold. </p> <figure data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, EA did not share how to perform Cole Palmer’s signature dance, but once the secret is out, you will see this celebration everywhere. For players who don’t like Chelsea or Palmer, plenty of other celebrations are worth trying. Diogo Jota, Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi all have their signature celebrations as well.</p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="false">Next up, players in the comment section also want <em>EA FC 24</em> to add Swedish star Viktor Gyökeres’ signature hands-over-the-mouth celebration. </p>

<p data-characters="157" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Pax Dei</em> is an open-world sandbox MMO that presents players with a colossal game world and gives them the tools to do pretty much anything they want with it. </p> <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="197" data-injectable="false">The game will be launched in Steam early access, but you might be wondering whether it will continue to be a free MMO or use a paid subscription model like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. </p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pax-dei-release-date-editions-and-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pax Dei</em> will be in Steam early access</a> for as long as developer Mainframe Industries needs to reach the goal of getting the game into a state where it feels it’s ready for a 1.0 launch. This could take a year, or it could take longer. While it’s in early access, the game can be purchased alongside a Founder’s Pack, but once it hits 1.0, the game won’t be in early access any longer, and that brings into question the subject of how the developer will continue to fund work on adding new features. </p>
 <h2 id="h-will-pax-dei-have-a-paid-subscription-after-steam-early-access" data-injectable="false">Will <em>Pax Dei</em> have a paid subscription after Steam early access?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Pax Dei | Early Access Announcement" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9kbu7qtYR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">During a preview event with Mainframe Industries, the developer confirmed that once <em>Pax Dei</em> leaves Steam early access, it will have a paid subscription model to support work on adding more features in the future. However, the developer couldn’t confirm how much that subscription would cost; it would probably be in line with what players expect to pay for an MMO subscription. </p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">There’s no point in speculating about the cost because subscription fees could change between <em>Pax Dei’</em>s early access release and its 1.0 launch. Server and energy costs may fluctuate, and it will likely be somewhat based on the average concurrent player count, so Mainframe Industries will need to work out how much it needs to fund continued development. </p> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="878" data-injectable="true">Mainframe Industries will need to charge a subscription fee once<em> Pax Dei</em> 1.0 has been released because it wants to keep the game alive and add to it for years to come. The player ecosystem of <em>EVE Online</em> is what the developer wants to achieve in <em>Pax Dei</em>, but doing that requires time and money. The initial influx of revenue from Founder’s Packs will go some way to funding the extra work and keeping the game alive, but if <em>Pax Dei</em> is to stand the test of time, it’ll need to generate cash somehow. </p>
 <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="false">It’s rare to see a game launch and charge players a subscription fee, while games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Destiny 2 </em>have moved into a battle pass model that effectively earns the same amount but offers players more upfront. Titles like <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> are still going strong with huge player bases who are happy to pay the subscription because they adore those games, which bodes well for <em>Pax Dei</em>, provided Mainframe Industries can deliver the game it has promised. </p>

<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As you navigate the Temptation mission, you’ll encounter a sealed passage within a cave. The only way to breach it is by changing the layout of three mechanisms. Here’s how to solve all the Temptation Conduit puzzles in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-way-to-start-the-final-shape-for-new-and-returning-destiny-2-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em>.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-deactivate-conduits-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-temptation-mission" data-injectable="false">How to deactivate Conduits in Destiny 2: The Final Shape Temptation mission</h2> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">Upon reaching the blocked cave entryway, you’ll notice several waypoints scattered across the map. The key to progressing here is to position the Conduits correctly, aligning them with a light beam. However, the crucial step is to <strong>eliminate the Insight Psions. </strong>Their defeat grants you Psionic Insight temporarily, a vital resource that allows you to manipulate the Conduits, rotating them either clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In space, no one can hear you scream. That didn’t stop millions of <em>Alien</em> fans from howling to the heavens when the latest trailer for <em>Alien: Romulus</em> dropped earlier today. This promising preview introduced us to <em>Romulus</em>‘ cast of young Xenomorph bait and revealed when the film will hit theaters.</p> <h2 id="h-alien-romulus-release-date" data-injectable="false"><strong>Alien: Romulus’ Release Date</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><em>Romulus</em>‘ trailer doesn’t pull its punches. It assaults viewers with a marathon of terrifying scenes that prove that the seventh installment of the <em>Alien</em> franchise will return<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-romulus-is-going-back-to-the-franchises-roots-in-new-trailer"> the series to its grungy, claustrophobic root</a>s. After a brutally effective smash cut to the title card, the trailer ends by unveiling the film’s release date, August 16, 2024.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">While the release date comes with an “only in theaters” subtitle, the film will likely be available on a streaming service a few months after its big-screen debut. Twentieth Century Studios produced <em>Romulus</em>, so the film will be available to stream on<a href="https://www.hulu.com/network/twentieth-century-studios-4e51bbc4-7a9e-442b-b7f1-673eed92cbcb"> Hulu</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-alien-romulus-cast-is-as-young-as-they-are-vulnerable" data-injectable="false"><strong>Alien: Romulus Cast is as young as they are vulnerable</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">Much like the original Alien film, Romulus follows a crew of very unlucky space travelers who stumble upon and fight for their lives against the titular alien predator. The cast of <em>Romulus</em> is quite a bit younger than those featured in other <em>Alien </em>films, with director Fede Álvarez<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/alien-romulus-trailer-ridley-scott-1235856321/"> explaining in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a> that he wanted to explore the <em>Alien</em> universe through the eyes of young people who are just learning how to navigate the stars.</p>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">The cast of<em> Romulus</em> consists almost entirely of talented twenty-something rising stars who have only just started breaking into leading roles in other films, so it will be fascinating to see how this cast compares to the star-studded casts of previous <em>Alien</em> films. Here are all of the actors featured in <em>Romulus</em>.</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true"> <li>Cailee Spaeny – Rain Carradine</li> <li>David Jonsson – Andy</li> <li>Archie Renaux – Tyler</li> <li>Isabela Merced – Kay</li> <li>Spike Fearn – Bjorn</li> <li>Aileen Wu – Navarro</li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-romulus-title-has-some-interesting-mythological-roots" data-injectable="false">Romulus’ title has some interesting mythological roots</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true"><em>Alien </em>films have a long history of referencing mythology and religion. <em>Romulus</em> is no exception. The film’s title, which doubles as the name of the abandoned space station our young heroes get trapped on, shares its num-de-plume with the legendary founder of Rome, who, according to the myth, was raised in the wild by a kindly she-wolf after he and his brother Remus were left in the woods to die by their traitorous uncle.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">The story of Romulus and the unfortunate fate of Remus is a tale drenched in themes of siblinghood, and <em>Romulus </em>will explore similar ideas<em>. </em>In<a href="https://ew.com/alien-romulus-director-fede-alvarez-star-cailee-spaeny-tease-new-xenomorph-8642159"> an interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, Alvarez explained that he wanted <em>Romulus</em>‘ core cast to be a sort of “small town found family.” If the founding myth of Rome is an accurate blueprint of <em>Romulus’ </em>story, the horrors these kids encounter might push their familial bond to its breaking point.</p>

That coldness seems to have seeped into the company itself too, as they racked up their career-killing bodycount with nearly 100 more layoffs this week.</p>

<p>Behaviour’s <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">announcement</a> - the opening of which ominously dubs the studio as “The Company” in true killer-like fashion - confirmed that they will look to cut up to 95 staff. Of those almost 100 devs, the majority will be laid off from the developers’ Montreal studio.</p>
<p>In true corpospeak, the announcement euphemistically dubbed the firing of dozens of people as “strategic changes for future growth”, citing a “challenging period for the games industry” amid “unprecedented competition” as part of thinking behind the move. The studio also noted that their headcount has more than doubled from just shy of 600 employees to 1,300 staff in the last five years, in what seems to be a sadly continuing trend of games companies having richly gorged themselves during the at-home pandemic boom - Behaviour calls it “remarkable growth” - only to forcibly vomit up their blameless workers as things then contract due to the lightening of lockdowns and the subsequent cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p>Behaviour say that the “multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure” - i.e. putting dozens upon dozens of people out of a job - will help “ improv[e] the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources” as the studio double down on their “historical strengths” of horror and development services, along with a possible expansion into whatever “location-based entertainment” means.</p>

<p>For all their hard work on the likes of Dead by Daylight, Behaviour waved off the laid-off devs with the caring, heartfelt acknowledgement that “each of these individuals offered valuable contributions to Behaviour” - which I’m sure they’ll be grateful for as they try to pay their rent and put food on the table - while adding that Dead by Daylight’s development won’t be affected by the changes. (Upcoming single-player spin-off The Casting of Frank Stone is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassive-reveal-the-casting-of-frank-stone-a-single-player-dead-by-daylight-game">worked on over at Supermassive</a>, so that won’t be affected either.)</p>
<p>“I would like to express my deep personal appreciation for any employee affected by today’s changes,” said CEO Rémi Racine. “While changes to our structure and strategic vision have led to challenging decisions, we are confident that these decisions will position us for continued success. As we begin the next phase of Behaviour’s growth, our commitment to excellence in our products and workplace culture remains steadfast.”</p>
<p>The latest layoffs at Behaviour come fewer than six months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">close to 50 staff were cut at the start of the year</a>, meaning around 10% of the studio have been dropped in 2024 so far. Behaviour are far from the only studio to be part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">the unrelenting barrage of job losses across the games industry over the last year or so</a>, with thousands of staff losing their jobs at developers, publishers and more. Hard to match that level of fear and wanton destruction with someone in a pig mask, honestly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9aZs9Z">In theory, Microsoft approaches this week’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">Summer Game Fest</a> and the annual Xbox showcase on June 9 from a position of fantastic strength: Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24055445/microsoft-q2-2024-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">supercharged the revenues</a> of its gaming division and turned it into a super-publisher the likes of which the game industry has never seen. It now owns an astonishing war chest of hall-of-fame gaming properties that includes Call of Duty, Minecraft, Warcraft, Halo, Fallout, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, Doom, Gears of War, Forza, and much, much more.</p>
<p id="gNeJ7F">Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer and his team are also well poised to make a strong impression in what is shaping up to be a fallow year for the rest of the industry. Sony, having already confessed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072730/no-new-ps5-games-exclusives-2024-release">PlayStation won’t see any major exclusive releases</a> this year, went early with a short, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/1/31/24057143/playstation-sony-state-of-play-ps5-showcase-announcements-trailers">low-key showcase</a> last week. Nintendo has delayed its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">successor console to the Switch</a> into 2025; at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151013/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announcement-teaser">its own showcase later in June</a> it will be forced to lean on whatever games it’s been able to scrape together for the Switch’s last holiday season. And Summer Game Fest MC Geoff Keighley has <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-2024-geoff-keighley-sets-expectations-1851516386">moved to temper expectations</a> for his roundup showcase on June 7.</p>
<p id="Mxdcgt">Microsoft has faced similar lulls in its release schedule in the recent past, but on this count it is now simply too big to fail. On the Activision Blizzard side, Microsoft will trumpet its ownership of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145559/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty with a special showcase</a> highlighting this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a>, and can point to big expansions coming this year to both <em>World of Warcraft </em>and <em>Diablo 4</em>. Bethesda has <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to show, plus a possible <em>Starfield </em>expansion, and a strongly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/">rumored new game in the Doom series</a>. Meanwhile, Xbox Game Studios is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122208/microsoft-xbox-kareem-choudhry-leaving-xbox-cloud-gaming">reportedly</a> ready to unveil a new Gears of War, as well as show more of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and Obsidian’s<em> </em>fantasy role-playing game <em>Avowed</em>.</p>
<p id="Q1KWrZ">That one of these three powerhouse gaming brands also happens to appear on game consoles almost seems like an afterthought. But this is precisely Microsoft’s problem — or one of them, anyway — as it prepares to deliver this crucial address to fans. In 2024, Xbox finds itself in the grip of a profound identity crisis.</p>

<p id="W68mD7">The Xbox fandom, and the wider gaming community, has been shaken over the last few months by reports that Microsoft (which already publishes all its games simultaneously on Xbox and PC) was planning to push deeper into multiplatform publishing by putting previously console-exclusive titles on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">Microsoft eventually did just that</a> with <em>Pentiment</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Grounded</em>, but reports persist that much bigger properties — including <em>Starfield</em>, the Indiana Jones game, and franchise jewels like Halo — are also on the table. Windows Central reports that there is <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">“no red line” for this initiative</a>, codenamed Latitude, and that more PlayStation versions of Xbox-owned games are in development.</p>
<p id="PweIJ5">The move has a simple business goal — increase the profit margins on Microsoft’s in-house games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166647/aaa-exclusive-games-are-dead-playstation-xbox-multiplatform">in a challenging market</a> — but it completely upends a foundational marketing strategy for console gaming, by which the worth and desirability of a platform are deeply linked to its exclusive games. This has become a tenet of almost religious faith for gamers, and the suggestion that it might be abandoned is head-spinning.</p>
<p id="rxmsJk">The context for Microsoft’s decision is important, too. With its push into PC, cloud gaming, mobile, and subscription services with Game Pass, and by buying <em>Minecraft</em>, Microsoft has been clearly signaling that it was thinking beyond the boundaries of Xbox consoles for a decade now. But the acquisition of Activision Blizzard went further by turning the company into a huge multiplatform publisher overnight. </p>

<p id="y445JU">Thanks to regulators, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797265/microsoft-sony-xbox-playstation-call-of-duty-deal">Microsoft couldn’t make Call of Duty Xbox-exclusive</a> even if it made sense to (it doesn’t). It isn’t any more likely that it would do the same to Blizzard’s games. A massive chunk of Microsoft’s gaming business now lies on PlayStation, Nintendo, and PC, and that’s bound to change the strategic thinking of Xbox leadership.</p>
<p id="jBIXpE">But while Microsoft’s gaming horizons have broadened, the same can’t be said for the Xbox platform itself. According to analysts quoted in the Financial Times, Xbox Series X and S were <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b89e9f7-e3cf-4e60-bfa4-987af24efa75">outsold three-to-one by PlayStation 5</a> in 2023. Microsoft does not report console sales figures, arguing they don’t present an accurate picture of the overall health of its games business. It does report figures for Game Pass, but only intermittently; after a period of rapid growth, the service seems to have plateaued somewhat at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">34 million subscribers</a>.</p>
<p id="1v998j">There are more troubling signs still. In early 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050311/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-layoff">laid off 1,900 workers</a> across its gaming division. This was very bad, though in line with the rest of the game industry, and arguably not the worst of it. That came in May, when the company <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">shuttered several Bethesda studios</a>, including Arkane Austin (<em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Redfall</em>) and Tango Gameworks (<em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>). The closures stirred uncomfortable memories of Microsoft’s botched management of other studios in the past — especially Fable developer Lionhead, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/29/11537392/lionhead-studios-closed">was shut down in 2016</a>.</p>

<p id="A547N8">The cumulative effect of all this is to raise huge existential questions for Xbox, and for Microsoft’s ambitions in gaming. What is Xbox now? Do the consoles matter at all? Is Microsoft now just a massive third-party publisher — a bigger EA? Is the Game Pass strategy working? How does owning Call of Duty help any of this? How has Halo, Xbox’s flagship franchise, been allowed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23590852/halo-infinite-343-industries-future-franchise-reboot">fall into disrepair</a>? And, perhaps most worryingly for players beyond the Xbox community: Can Microsoft be trusted to keep tabs on this vast empire and manage all these beloved properties and storied studios responsibly, without doing irreparable damage like we saw with Fable and Lionhead?</p>
<p id="szRBhZ">On Sunday, Spencer and his team need to do something much more nuanced, and challenging, than just unleash a megaton of game announcements. They need to organize all this bigness into a coherent vision for Xbox’s place in the industry, its relationship to fans, and its strategy for the future. They need to be extremely clear in their messaging about exclusivity on all upcoming games. They need to show commitment to Game Pass (this is where Call of Duty comes in — with regulators insisting the series remains available on rival cloud services and consoles, Game Pass is the only strategic play open to Microsoft with CoD). And they need to show commitment to console hardware; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview">unveiling a new handheld</a> would go a long way here.</p>
<p id="82TitY">To be fair to Xbox management, these are uncharted waters. No one has ever attempted to combine the roles of platform holder and third-party publisher before, and whether the move makes sense at all remains an open question. On Sunday, Microsoft needs to show the gaming community why it was worth doing, and how it will make a brighter future for both the industry and the art form — rather than just eating them up and running them down. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-skin-sells-1-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The most expensive skin ever sold <strong>publically </strong>in Counter-Strike history has just changed hands for over $1 million. The final sum wasn’t disclosed by the private buyer, but it was referenced that the transaction was worth ‘more than $1 million’. It was a StatTrak Factory New AK-47 in Blue Gem (Pattern 661), a one-of-one weapon skin that was shielded in secrecy for more than a decade. It was known to be in the wild, but it was never revealed who owned it – but the value of the skin was always common knowledge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moolah">Moolah</h2>



<p>In January 2024, the Blue Gem AK-47 – a one-of-a-kind skin – was ‘discovered’, with many users surmising it had been unboxed in a CS weapon case. This extraordinary pull would have had the clout to turn an average gamer into a millionaire overnight – but it’s believed that it sat firmly in the grip of a collector for several years. In 2022, a slightly ‘more worn’ variant of this skin sold for a whopping $400,000 – but that’s far from being the most expensive Counter-Strike skin ever auctioned off.</p>



<p>This news was broken on social media by Jake Lucky, who shared an attractive montage of the weapon:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The most expensive skin in Counterstrike history was publicly sold this morning, a StatTrak Factory New AK-47 Blue Gem pattern 661</p><p>For over $1 million <a href="https://t.co/1FdxoNM2ov">pic.twitter.com/1FdxoNM2ov</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1798387413313868135?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Last year, one user unboxed a $150,000 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-csgo-player-blue-gem-karambit-lucky/">rare Blue Gem Karambit</a> – a type of knife – mere weeks into playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Before that, a wealthy Chinese collector secured a super-rare AK-47 skin <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/csgo-ak47-skin-sold/">for a staggering $160,000</a>.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed CS skins the ‘OG NFTs’, but what’s ironic is that the value of these top-tier cosmetics has outlasted the value of the most popular NFTs, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-concord-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>There is an unfortunate and rising trend of upcoming titles, specifically once-console-exclusive games from PlayStation that require a third-party account to run on PC. We saw it with Helldivers 2, where the community came together to revolt against Sony’s decision. Even today, that decision isn’t fully reversed. But here we are once more. Does Concord require a PSN account on PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-a-psn-account-for-concord">Do You Need a PSN Account for Concord?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, like with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-god-of-war-ragnarok-require-a-psn-account-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-until-dawn-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a>, users will require a PSN account for Concord once it launches on PC. The upcoming hero shooter will require a PlayStation Network connection on Steam and Epic Games Stores, meaning you can’t play the online-only game if you don’t have a PSN account. There are still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 120 countries where the PlayStation Network isn’t available</a>. That’s countless millions of players left in the dust yet again.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, following State of Play, Concord proved to be the most lackluster announcement of the bunch. By now, most people find themselves exhausted by hero-based arena shooters, and yet developers keep forcing them out the door. The decision to require a PSN account on PC doesn’t help anyone, especially not the studio behind the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-concord">What is Concord?</h2>



<p>During the first few minutes of the game’s announcement, I thought Concord was a single-player adventure in the same style as Guardians of the Galaxy. Instead, the team revealed a 5v5 arena shooter with hero characters—a PvP-only, frantic first-person shooter focused on social play and semi-competitive gameplay elements.</p>



<p>We’re still learning more about the game, and perhaps it will surprise us in the end, so fingers crossed for something a little more unique!</p>

Over the years many indie developers have bigged up Game Pass, with money paid by Microsoft taking much of the risk out of launching new games across multiple platforms. Day-one Game Pass deals are even more lucrative. Hypercharge: Unboxed, it seems, has achieved relative success on Xbox without either.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Summer is almost here, and Rockstar Games is kicking off the season with a new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/">GTA Online</a>.

            <p>
UK high street chain GAME will no longer offer Xbox All Access to new subscribers beginning later this month, Eurogamer can confirm. 
</p>
<p>
Xbox All Access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-all-access-the-best-way-to-buy-an-xbox-series-x-or-xbox-series-s">which lets you pay for an Xbox Series X or S console via 24 monthly installments</a>, is available through only a handful of partner retailers globally, and just three in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
GAME is by far the largest chain to have supported the subscription, but Eurogamer understands it is now dropping the offer as part of an ongoing series of changes as many of its high street stores are replaced by concessions in other Frasers Group chains, such as Sports Direct.
</p>

<p>
Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">GAME was scrapping its long-running GAME Rewards membership scheme</a>, including its premium Elite tier. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">we also reported that GAME was set to drop its trade-in program</a>, too. 
</p>
<p>
In each case, Eurogamer understands this is to streamline the offerings GAME provides as the brand operates increasingly out of concessions.
</p>
<p>
"GAME is simplifying its credit offering and, as of 26th June, will no longer be offering Xbox All Access," a GAME spokesperson confirmed to Eurogamer. "This decision will not impact any of our existing Xbox All Access customers. 
</p>
<p>
"We continue to offer our full range of Xbox products and customers will be able to apply for flexible financing options through Frasers Plus."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has separately confirmed it will continue to offer Xbox All Access in the UK. Currently, the scheme is operated here by GAME, Smyths Toys and 4Gadgets.
</p>
<p>
"Xbox All Access - which allows players to purchase Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass for a monthly price - will continue to be available at participating retailers throughout the UK,"  a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
It's been a year of change for GAME, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">moves staff to zero-hour contracts and makes others redundant</a>, while the company shifts to operate from fewer high street outlets.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/summer-game-fest-to-be-good-for-horror-fans-with-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-more-teased.890406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show is only a couple days away, and, as you would expect, the teases for what we can expect at the show have begun. It seems like Summer Game Fest will be particularly good for horror fans, as a majority of the things teased for the show thus far have been horror related.</p>
<p>First up, Remedy has posted this teaser, which seems to be a reference to the upcoming “Night Springs” story DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dark Triangle Coffee. Just coffee, nothing else. Have a sip at Night Springs' One and Only Coffee World.</p>
<p>Join the percolation on June 7th... in Night Springs.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NightSprings?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NightSprings</a> <a href="https://t.co/qzXEwVxDWB">pic.twitter.com/qzXEwVxDWB</a></p>
<p>— Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1798006904150458559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up, here’s how Remedy has <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-story-dlc-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously described the Night Springs DLC</a>…</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visions and dreams. Fiction is written and coming true. Fiction collapses and remains just words on a page. These are those stories… in Night Springs.</em></li>
<li><em>Play as several familiar characters from the world of Alan Wake and experience the unexplainable in multiple self-contained episodes of Night Springs, a fictional tv-show set in the world of Alan Wake.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Second, Geoff Keighley has promised Blumhouse Games will be officially unveiled. Blumhouse is, of course, the biggest name in horror cinema right now, and some movie production companies, like Annapurna, have had quite a bit of success in the realm of video games recently, so this is something to watch.</p>
<blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171995/killers-game-trailer-release-date-cast-dave-bautista-action-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YKh9Sx">It’s finally Dave Bautista’s time to shine as a bona fide action lead. The first trailer for <em>The Killer’s Game</em>, an assassin comedy with a star-studded cast and action royalty behind the camera, has dropped. The movie, based on the novel by <em>The Walking Dead</em> comics co-writer Jay Bonansinga, is coming to theaters September 13.</p>
<p id="v3THfO">Bautista plays an assassin diagnosed with a terminal illness who decides to put out a hit on himself for a quick death, rather than have him and his partner suffer through the deterioration of his health. But when he finds out his doctor made a mistake and he’s not actually dying, he has to fend for his life against some of the deadliest killers in the world. It’s a bit similar to the set up of last year’s <em>King of Killers</em>, starring Frank Grillo as an assassin who put out a hit on himself, but with a more fun twist and a much more exciting lineup.</p>
<p id="8vnwrD">Bautista has been largely relegated to side roles in the action genre, and here’s a real chance for him to shine in a genre well-suited to his considerable skills. And you can bet he’ll shine, with the support around him. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>is directed by legendary stunt performer and action director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23301622/action-horror-comedy-movies-like-day-shift-watch-streaming">J.J. Perry</a>, who has been involved in a significant percentage of the great American action movies of the past 30 years, from <em>Blade </em>to <em>John Wick</em>. Perry’s feature debut as a director, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23301934/day-shift-review-netflix-vampire-movie-jamie-foxx-scott-adkins"><em>Day Shift</em></a>,<em> </em>was a fun vampire action comedy starring Jamie Foxx with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23301720/day-shift-vampires-netflix-contortionists-jamie-foxx-jj-perry">creative action choreography and camera work</a>. </p>
<p id="zmu4hf">Bautista will also have more support than just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23835899/blue-beetle-flight-scenes-action-director-interview">Perry</a>. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>has a tantalizing cast, with Ben Kingsley (I’m obsessed with how he says “There are only two ways out of the killer’s game, Joseph”), Pom Klementieff, Sofia Boutella, Terry Crews, and WWE wrestler Drew McIntyre all involved. For the action diehards, the presence of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2021/1/29/22256482/scott-adkins-breaks-down-video-game-fights-mortal-kombat">Scott Adkins</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23664737/fist-of-the-condor-movie-review-marko-zaror-martial-arts">Marko Zaror</a> (who features heavily in the trailer), and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22973113/hell-hath-no-fury-hulu-thriller-movie-watch">Daniel Bernhardt</a> is especially appealing. All three are legends in their own right, and Bernhardt in particular has made a career of making movie stars look god at kicking his ass (<em>Atomic Blonde</em>, <em>Nobody</em>).</p>
<p id="nXbyhO">The project’s been in the works pretty much since Bonansinga’s novel came out in 1997. At different points over the past few decades, Wesley Snipes, Michael Keaton, and Jason Statham were each attached in the lead role. But ultimately, it’s Bautista who got the part, and it seems like a promising vehicle for his combination of charm, humor, and physical ability as a former professional athlete.</p>
<p id="SoAoJh">The trailer advertises lots of action and plenty of gore, as Bautista shoots, stabs, and garrotes his way through a bevy of targets. The comedy’s a bit hit-or-miss for me in the trailer, but that’s how trailers go sometimes. The lineup of talent and the teases of great action are more than enough for me to be counting down the days to September. </p>
