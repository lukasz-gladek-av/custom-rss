<p>In a series of changes and improvements being made to Escape from Tarkov in patch 0.14.9.5, Battlestate Games has introduced some interesting updates. One important mechanic will see players compensated for successfully reporting cheaters – but the reward itself hasn’t been clarified yet. This means that when you report someone and you’re notified that they’ve been banned, you’ll get <strong>something </strong>in the way of compensation, be it roubles, random items, or something else.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-for-nothing">Money for Nothing</h2>



<p>Presently, a change like this could make you a Tarkov millionaire overnight. It’s no big secret that the game is still being plagued by cheaters, and no server seems to be safe. At least now you’ll get a little something back in your pocket if you report these malicious operators and they’re kicked off the platform.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Battlestate Games revealed that soon, the newly introduced PvE mode will be available for purchase for owners of all game editions – and several changes are coming to <strong>that </strong>part of the game. First, improvements are on the way for AI PMCs in PvE, and the ability to reset your profile is also inbound. For solo PvE players, Battlestate is introducing local play, allowing users to get access to a game almost immediately, bypassing the need to queue for a server. </p>



<p>Tweaks are also being made to the in-game wishlist mechanic, new outfits are being added to the game (via Ragman), and a fresh questline called ‘Nostalgia’ is being added. Battlestate is bringing in an in-game poll system (but we’re not sure how it’ll work), and the team is pumping in a slew of quality-of-life changes.</p>



<p>This patch was supposed to go live this month, but it has now been pushed back to early July.</p>

<p>TwitchCon Europe 2024 is ongoing in Rotterdam, and to kick off the event, representatives of the platform announced changes coming to the ecosystem – as well as some interesting new features and mechanics that’ll change how the platform works. There’s nothing <strong>groundbreaking</strong>, but a few of these changes should increase collaboration and discovery, which are some of the most important aspects for new streamers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-starts-with-the-app">It Starts With The App</h2>



<p>Since 2019, the Twitch app has remained relatively the same in terms of its overall appearance – but that’s changing. In May, a test group received a new, upgraded look for their Twitch mobile app, and soon, it’ll be rolled out globally. This changes how users interact with the application, covering everything from the menus to new discovery feeds that give users direct access to algorithm-driven collections of clips. </p>



<p>It was <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/06/29/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-rotterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Twitch</a> that clips are one of the most important areas looked at in the recent round of changes. They’re being optimised on the platform for discovery, with Twitch bringing around a better flow for a feed that mimics sites like TikTok. Everything from clip creation to editing and ultimately sharing your clips has been improved – or will be in the near future.</p>



<p>Alongside tidbits like a new Enhanced Broadcasting Beta for NVIDIA-based streamers and the opening of an enrolment pathway for the new DJ program sat another juicy piece of information: Creator Clubs. Twitch is debuting a new ‘program’ that ‘helps streamers find communities around shared interests’. It’s social networking for Twitch, allowing users to join curated clubs, share content and make friends based on their likemindedness. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dr-disrespect-allegations-journalists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The reason Dr Disrespect got banned from Twitch is finally out there. Thank goodness. Now we can stop talking about him. We figured, however, that we’d dip one last bucket into that well by spotlighting the good work of Ash Parrish, our former Kotaku colleague turned Verge reporter, who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played a pivotal role in verifying the allegations</a>. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talked to her about how it all came together.</p><p>We begin by asking Ash what happened in the immediate aftermath (dot site) of an ex-Twitch employee’s decision to suddenly tweet out the reason behind Dr Disrespect’s ban last Friday. Why is that what it took to shake loose new sources, and how did reporters verify that they actually knew what they were talking about? Then we answer one of the major questions the recent torrent of information has produced: Why did it take journalists – some of whom had known the reason for years beforehand – so long to <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally make it public</a>? Why now? We also talk about the process of reporting out sensitive stories involving victims and <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what we think will happen next</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, we move on to a discussion of<em> Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, an expansion so divisive that it summons Chris Person from The Land of Shadow to share his misgivings. Lastly, we come up with a killer game idea based on the TV show <em>Severance</em> (call us, Apple).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can launch our own edgy streamer persona who [five seconds later] we regret to inform you that the edgy streamer persona <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake_Duck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a terrible person</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What happened on your end, Ash, that allowed you to confirm this after it had been so hard for people to figure out?</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> What happened with me was that this whole thing came out late Friday, and I received a message from someone who said they worked at Twitch on the trust and safety team, and that they had some additional context to share. And after a conversation with this person that was able to confirm some details and essentially prove they were who they said they were, we were able to publish a story that was essentially able to corroborate what Cody Conners – who was the Twitch employee who first tweeted it out – was tweeting.&nbsp;</p><p>And then from there, dominoes started falling. Cecilia D’Anastasio at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-25/youtuber-dr-disrespect-was-allegedly-kicked-off-twitch-for-messaging-minor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> was also able to publish a piece with a couple more sources from Twitch – firsthand sources that kind of shed light on this. And then after that, we got confirmation from Dr Disrespect himself that basically was like “Yeah, I did the things that they are saying I did.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>That confirmation took the form of a <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> on his Twitter account. It wasn’t to any reporters or anything. In case people aren’t caught up on this nightmare we’ve been living in for a week.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Right. And so the reason he got banned is that he was exchanging messages via Twitch’s DM system – their Whisper system, is what it was called – with a minor in 2017, and these were explicit messages. Not the kind of thing that any sane adult should be exchanging with a minor. Basically what happened is, when Twitch caught wind of this in 2020 – as a result of somebody reporting it – Twitch moved extremely rapidly to ban Dr Disrespect.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what made it really hard for a lot of reporters to confirm it. When it first happened back in 2020, I tried to report it out and had a few different sources telling me “Here’s the basics of what happened.” It’s been the same story ever since. But those sources were like “Well, I wasn’t there at the time; I only heard this from somebody who was there. But I can’t give you their information. I can’t tell you who they are.” The reason for that is that the number of people who were there at the time – because Twitch sort of bypassed its own protocols to do this – was very, very small.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know if you heard this, Ash, but the impression I’ve gotten over the years is that it was maybe 10-15 people who were present or helped make the decision, and then most of the rest of Twitch was in the dark.</p><p><strong>Ash: </strong>That’s the key element to all of this, because one of the things that has come out now that this story is out so much is [commentary like] “Well, Twitch should be investigated because they covered up a crime” or “The journalists who are tweeting like they knew about it or heard about it were sitting on a story to profit” or whatever. The thing people don’t understand – that, Riley, you have written about – is we can’t just write about the first thing that comes across our desk.</p><p>Especially for a story like this, involving sensitive material like exploiting minors or big famous people with lots of money, you have to be airtight. You have to make sure that the things you are reporting are airtight from people with firsthand knowledge of the situation. For a long time, we didn’t have that. And now, because this person that I spoke to was on the trust and safety team at the time [Disrespect] was banned and had firsthand information on how all of that went down, we were finally able to report the way that we were.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> The response to me has been so interesting because I took the stance that it does feel weird. I don’t fault normal people for being like “What the hell?” after the tweet came out Friday night. I feel like there was a surge of people corroborating that they heard it. So I understand the reaction of “Wait, did everybody know about this?” But the situation has been useful to me, a journalist who always wants to talk about journalism, for talking about how journalism works. Our colleague Mikhail <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a really good newsletter</a> about why people haven’t reported on it. So it was exciting for me to see you get something out Sunday night. I feel a bit of pride that you and Cecilia [were responsible for corroborating the story]. I’ve been an editor to both of you, and I was like “Aw, my children!”</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> Kotaku alumni. Hell yeah. There’s a funny personal story related to how all of that happened, but I don’t think this is the venue for it. But one day, I will share.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You can’t drop a bomb like that and then say “But later!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Here’s something you can maybe talk about: I’ve seen a lot of people say they want to see the proof, and people want to know how you know. I saw a lot of the less savory elements of the internet be like “Oh, that’s anonymous sources. That’s hearsay!” I know from being an editor that everything you report goes through a rigorous legal process, and I’ve done this with Nathan where you tediously go through every quote in a story checking and checking and checking, and I was wondering if you could speak at all to what process you went through on your end with The Verge.</p><p><strong>Ash: </strong>So the number one thing – and the thing that scared me about this initially – was, you always want to feel like the people who are speaking to you confidentially are speaking to you in good faith and that you can believe the things they’re telling you, because they’re taking great personal risk to do so. But you always have to be skeptical. So one of the things that we did to make sure before we reported what we did is [confirm] that this person is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels weird because it’s like “I don’t want you to believe that I think you’re lying, but I have to prove who you are. Are you comfortable with sharing that information with me?” To this person’s credit, they were. We were really grateful for that, because there are gonna be a lot of times when – especially when you get down to brass tacks in reporting a story like this – somebody will approach you and be like “I have insider information about this that I want to talk about, but I want to be anonymous,” and they’ll tell you their story, but then when it’s time to write the story and I need some clarifying information and I need them to prove who they are, they kinda get cold feet. They’re like “Oh shit, if I tell this person who I am – even though they’ve said they’re not gonna share my identity – I’m afraid that the things I have said could potentially reveal who I am.” And so they back out, and that’s how a lot of pieces die.</p><p>So thankfully this person who spoke to me did not get that kind of cold feet. They were able to be like “This is me, and this is what I did. Here’s all my stuff” – their bonafides that made it such that we could report it that way. And to Riley’s point about proof, with this specific case, involving the topics it involves – including potential exploitation of a minor and sexting – you cannot keep that kind of evidence. That’s not something Twitch wants to keep on its servers. That’s not something you want to personally possess.&nbsp;</p><p>So I understand this desire of “Let me see everything with my own two eyes,” but there are a lot of legal entanglements that prevent that kind of thing. So I understand why people want to ask that, but you don’t need to see it because, first of all, it involves a minor, and second of all, your chances of getting it are very low because companies don’t keep that shit on the books. Because they open themselves to a lot of legal liability if they do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’ve seen people like <a href="https://x.com/Tfue/status/1805971554062291272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tfue</a> say, like, “Show the Whispers.” And it’s like, OK well, this involves a victim. Even if someone somehow got their hands on the whispers, the victim may not have consented to those being shown. That could do potential harm to the victim both in terms of exposing their identity and also just in terms of showing something really sensitive from when they were literally a kid. That does emotional damage. That hurts somebody. The victim has not come forward after all these years. There is likely a reason for that. So to just show the Whispers for the sake of proving to people – who, by the way, will never be satisfied no matter how much evidence they see – that this is real, that just harms the victim.</p><p>I think on the internet there’s this desire for lurid detail. But what you need is all out there. Doc said he did it. Companies have dropped him after doing their own investigations. Journalists have looked into it. It’s all out there. The rest is just this desire for people online to be able to gawk at the absolute most heinous shit they can look at. And that, I think, is a really unfortunate instinct.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Newcastle had lost and, to make matters worse, Adams’ journey home was being delayed by snow. That is, it kept covering his windscreen and he had to repeatedly stop and get out of the car to clear it.</p><p>Some kind of innovation was needed. There had to be something that would help people see where they were going.</p><p>As it turned out, there was; a few years later Adams invented his own windscreen wiper. He patented the design and became one of several people from around the beginning of the 1900s credited with conceiving of similar devices, although his version of the windscreen wiper never made it into production.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>3D driving games had quickly become Reflections’ specialty, but the team knew you couldn’t tread water in a genre long famous for being on the cutting edge of video game technology.</p></div><p>Nearly a century down the track, Newcastle upon Tyne developer Reflections had found itself riding high on a purple patch of PlayStation success, propelled by the popular Destruction Derby series it had developed for legendary British publisher Psygnosis. 3D driving games had quickly become Reflections’ specialty, but the team knew you couldn’t tread water in a genre long famous for being on the cutting edge of video game technology. Some kind of innovation was needed. Something that would help people see where the future of driving games was going.</p><p>As it turned out, Reflections founder Martin Edmondson had just such an idea – and, unlike their fellow Novocastrian’s windscreen wipers, Edmondson’s idea <em>did</em> make it into production.</p><p>And it completely redefined what a driving game could be, forever.</p><p>Founded in 1984, Reflections spent the bulk of its first decade building action games for early home computers like the BBC Micro and Amiga, but by the mid ’90s it would become a house of horsepower. Reflections established its panel-punishing prowess on PlayStation very early; indeed, the original Destruction Derby was released in October 1995. At this stage, it had barely been a month since the original PlayStation had officially launched in the West.</p><p>A highly praised sequel arrived just over a year later, with a raft of technical improvements, and in 1997 Reflections released the competent but unremarkable Monster Trucks (otherwise known as Thunder Truck Rally in North America). However, while the Destruction Derby series would continue, the partnership between Reflections and publisher Psygnosis would not.</p><p>Unshackled from its publisher commitments, Reflections pivoted to something else. That something else was Driver, and it was going to be something special. GT Interactive certainly thought so. By December 1998, it was so impressed the publisher literally bought Reflections entirely.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-sf-1719314533004.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It's the original Driver San Francisco.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Driver, which first launched in June 1999, was unlike anything that had come before it. These days it seems less common for a game to come along and establish the foundations of what’s essentially a brand new sub-genre, but wind the clock back a couple of decades and it was happening with steady regularity. In the scheme of driving games, Driver was truly one-of-a-kind.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Driver did more than just take the brash, car chase gameplay from the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games and bring it to life in 3D.</p></div><p>Driver did more than just take the brash, car chase gameplay from the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games and bring it to life in 3D – it distilled the mayhem of some of Hollywood’s greatest ever car chase classics and made them <em>playable</em>.</p><p>Smokey and the Bandit, The Blues Brothers, The Cannonball Run, Bullitt – the team took inspiration from countless car chase classics. Martin Edmondson was particularly passionate about them; Walter Hill’s 1978 film The Driver was one of the first movies he ever saw at a cinema.</p><p>The Driver, a minimalist neo-noir action thriller set in the underbelly of LA, was not particularly successful upon its release – but it has amassed an admirable legacy. It didn’t just inspire Driver, that is; Nicolas Winding Refn’s 2011 film Drive respectfully shares several thematic similarities, it was a core inspiration for Edgar Wright’s 2017 film Baby Driver, and it’s been referenced on multiple occasions by Quentin Tarantino.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/the-driver-1719309397030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"Better get new plates if you plan on taking it out again."</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Driver’s influence on Driver the game goes far beyond the name, too. The infamous garage test at the beginning of Driver’s story mode was directly inspired by a strikingly similar scene in The Driver, where Ryan O’Neal’s unnamed getaway driver meticulously mangles a Mercedes (all while still keeping it drivable) in a calculated display of his precision driving abilities. The twist in Driver is that players are <em>punished</em> for denting the car. Ironically, doing so will trigger the very same car crash sound effect <em>specifically used in this very scene in The Driver</em> (alongside a host of other car chase movies from the ’70s and ’80s, mostly from 20th Century Fox).</p><p>Driver’s garage test is regarded by some as harder than any mission in the game that followed, although I can’t imagine that’s a sentiment that any Driver fan who actually played the game’s finale would share (‘The President’s Run’ is <em>monumentally more difficult</em> than the garage test). <a href="https://x.com/MrLukeReilly/status/1805566497772945505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playing and completing the test for the first time in many, many years</a>, I can’t help but wonder whether its reputation as an uncommonly gruelling challenge is a little overblown. Admittedly, Driver was essentially a religion for me during the last year-or-so of the original PlayStation so I’m not the best gauge – but I’ll note my 15-year-old son needed just four cracks to beat it, playing on original hardware. So I can’t say it stumped him, either.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-garage-1719314484732.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Show us what you can do!</figcaption></figure></output><p>That said, if you did in fact bounce off Driver because of its unfriendly first mission, you missed out on an absolutely amazing and unprecedented driving experience.</p><p>Sliding behind the wheel of a slate of '70s muscle cars as former race driver-turned-undercover cop Tanner, it was your job to lay rubber across four US cities – Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York – all in the name of high-speed justice. Each of these cities are fascinatingly distinct. Sun-drenched Miami features lengthy causeways and addictive bridge leaps, while San Francisco is packed with drastic elevation changes, trams, and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. LA’s missions occur exclusively at night, amplifying the seediness (and again paying homage to The Driver, in which director Hill deliberately shot all the chase sequences for at night). New York is a dense maze of grids and tunnels, framed with high buildings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/driver-ny-1719563982485.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The maps were incredible, but so too was the handling. Driver’s hulking American pony cars and land yachts weren’t exactly rapid or nimble by typical gaming standards for the time, but they were nonetheless outstandingly satisfying to throw into elbows-out powerslides and over huge jumps (where the era-accurate suspension would often see them bouncing a second time as the soggy springs absorbed their All-American bulk).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>From its flying hubcaps to its fabulous funk soundtrack, Driver’s dedication to bringing the spirit of ’70s and ’80s car chases back to life on PlayStation was dazzling. </p></div><p>From its flying hubcaps to its fabulous funk soundtrack, Driver’s dedication to bringing the spirit of ’70s and ’80s car chases back to life on PlayStation was dazzling. Sentimentally speaking, it’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/luke-reillys-top-30-games-of-all-time">one of my favourite games of all time</a>. Depending on what mood you catch me in, it may be my outright favourite, ever.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/driver-la-1719563740027.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Driver was a game I wished existed, and then suddenly it did.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For clarity, Reflections didn’t <em>quite</em> break through alone. Angel Studios’ Midtown Madness did, after all, speed onto PCs in 1999 also (a few weeks before Driver hit PlayStation). An open world racer set in Chicago, Midtown Madness set the tone for taking traditional racing to the streets. Open worlds would become the studio’s area of expertise, and Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego) would later flex that strength in the likes of Midnight Club, Smuggler’s Run, and Red Dead Redemption.</p><p>Still, that Ubisoft has let the legacy of Driver languish since the release of 2011’s much-loved Driver: San Francisco is downright depressing. A groundbreaking achievement in every way, Driver deserves so much better.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That Ubisoft has let the legacy of Driver languish since the release of 2011’s much-loved Driver: San Francisco is downright depressing.</p></div><p>Today, Driver is a relic. In 1999, however, Driver was truly ahead of its time. A pioneer. Contemporaneous audiences agreed. Or, at least, the ones that could pass the first mission did. It’s one of the top 30 best-selling games on PlayStation, ever. Wedged roughly somewhere between the acclaimed super sequel Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 and monster hit Resident Evil 3, Driver was certainly no sales slouch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/driver-miami-1719314583493.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It sold faster than a speeding Bullitt.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In other words, it’s more than some curio in the history of open world driving games that some gamers may otherwise believe began with the likes of Grand Theft Auto III.  </p><p>Perhaps you disagree. After all, all Reflections had to do was assemble four, enormous free-roaming city environments (the likes of which had never been built before), craft AI that could respond and effectively pursue players through them (which didn’t exist), compliment it with a class-leading vehicular damage system (that few racing developers of the era seemed capable of matching), and throw in a full replay editor for players to create custom car movies (on a console with 2MB of RAM).</p><p>Easy, right?</p><p>Well, in the words of Driver’s own tricky tutorial: show us what you can do.</p><p><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

		<p>We’ll be halfway through the year at the end of the weekend, which is one of those “Where the fork did all the time go?” moments in life. Still, at least it’s not quite as hot as it was earlier in the week, so you can have this existential crisis without sweating buckets at the same time.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has gained a reputation, and not unfairly, for double- or even triple-dipping on its beloved catalog of classic games. From Super Mario All-Stars on Super NES, to the Classic NES Collection on Game Boy Advance, to modern HD remasters like Metroid Prime and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Nintendo has never been shy about capitalizing on its history. As we move into an increasingly digital era, Nintendo has also been noticeably slow to adopt a single, cross-generation digital library akin to PlayStation and Xbox. We've seen lots of speculation over whether Nintendo will finally break this trend as it moves into the era of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch successor</a>--and recent remasters like Luigi's Mansion 2 HD show why it's so necessary that the company follows through with this pro-consumer move.</p><p dir="ltr">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is a remaster of a 2013 3DS game, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review-weegee-board/1900-6418246/">pretty good one at that</a>. I enjoyed revisiting the 3DS game on a modern system and felt it was paying homage to its history. But it's precisely because this appealed to me as a historical artifact that I couldn't help but think about what it means for my digital collection. Luigi's Mansion 2 is, so far, the middle chapter of a series that has already grown past it. It's nice to have the game unshackled from the 3DS, but that won't matter if its destiny is just to get shackled to the Nintendo Switch instead.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To be blunt, Luigi's Mansion 2 is good but slight. It's an enjoyable little chapter and a neat way to see how the Luigi's Mansion series has developed, but it's lower on the tier list of vital remasters than games that are older, more in need of modernization, or just difficult to find. The mere existence of an HD remaster of Luigi's Mansion 2 shows how Nintendo is filling its release calendar, which is a fine strategy as the Switch lives an especially long time for a console. And it's far from the last. At its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/">June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, the company announced a remaster of Donkey Kong Country Returns, a game that was already ported to the 3DS shortly after its initial release on the Wii and is now making the journey to Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not been especially forward-facing in its online tools. It's clear that when the 3DS was released, the company hadn't fully developed its online infrastructure to last into the future. This spate of Wii U and 3DS remasters may be because that account system was not built for the future, Nintendo wants to untether its games from the dual-screen and 3D functionality, or some combination of both.</p><p dir="ltr">But there are hopeful signs that the company is learning. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said last year that the formation of a single unified "Nintendo Account" will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-says-transition-from-switch-to-next-console-will-be-smoother-than-before/1100-6518543/">smooth the transition</a> into the next console. While previous hardware had each set up their own distinct account systems, which tied your digital purchases to them, the Switch Online service seems to be under the umbrella of your overall Nintendo Account. That means that when we move to the Switch 2--or whatever it may be named--your account will come with it. Nintendo will at least recognize which games you already own digitally. Backwards compatibility with new hardware is its own distinct technical challenge, and Bowser stopped short of confirming it, but the new system recognizing your existing digital library is a necessary first step.</p><p dir="ltr">And that's a step that is more important now than ever before. Nintendo has already been slow to adopt a modern approach to your digital library, which has been frustrating, but its library of stellar games and years of goodwill has carried it through. Falling behind for another entire generation would be much harder to forgive. Not to mention, it would do damage to the company's own reputation and value proposition going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">To understand why, we just need to look at the words of one of Nintendo's console rivals. Xbox head Phil Spencer gave a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-no-world-where-starfield-is-so-good-people-sell-their-ps5-and-move-to-xbox-phil-spencer-says/1100-6513821/">blunt assessment</a> of its own console business, saying that when it lost the race between PS4 and Xbox One, it created a ripple effect going forward. Since that was the generation that most consumers started building their digital library, he said, it was the worst generation for Xbox to lose. Consumers don't want to switch to a different console when they already have their digital library in an existing ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">Going even further back, its competitors have done more than Nintendo to offer their earliest games as part of your permanent collection. Hundreds of Xbox 360 games simply work on modern Xbox consoles, disc and all. Original Xbox games can be purchased and remain in your library, for example, and many are included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">as part of Game Pass</a>. To whatever extent this is an ongoing technical hurdle, it's one that others solved years ago while Nintendo continues to struggle.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo isn't going head-to-head with PlayStation and Xbox the way those two are directly challenging each other. For the last several generations, it has marched to the beat of its own drum and remained safely out of the power-console fray. But there's a lesson to be learned about how gamers perceive the value of their purchases regardless. Going forward, players expect their games to come with them. We don't need to buy a third version of Luigi's Mansion 2 on the next Switch, or a fourth version of Donkey Kong Country Returns. If Nintendo wants players to respect its long history of great games, it needs to let us build a digital collection that lasts.</p>

            <p>Saber Interactive has cancelled the public beta test for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 in order to "prepare for the full launch".</p>
<p>Citing that running a beta now "would take the development teams away from preparing for the full launch", the team acknowledged "this is disappointing news for some of you", and offered the limited Bolt Pistol skin as compensation to those who'd signed up to participate.</p>

<p>"Space Marine 2 is almost ready," the team said via an update posted to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4225021101189985804">Steam</a>. "We are now entirely focused on optimisation, polish and fixing remaining issues ahead of launch on 9th September. This means we will not run a public online beta, as it would take the development teams away from preparing for the full launch, and our priority is to ensure the best possible experience at release.</p>
<p>"We know this is disappointing news for some of you. As a thank you to those interested in participating, players who registered via the online signup before 28th June, 2024, midnight Paris Time, will receive the limited Bolt Pistol skin."</p>
<p>The statement closed on thanking players for their "understanding and continued support as [the team] works towards delivering the exceptional game you deserve".</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - which follows the continuing adventures of original series protagonist Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus (this time voiced by Clive Standen) - was originally due to launch in "winter" last year, but Focus announced a delay as part of an "update on execution of the line-up and partnerships" back in November. It's now set to release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 9th September 2024.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-will-include-a-pvp-mode-according-to-this-art-book-leak">a Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 art book has leaked online</a>, confirming the delayed game by Saber Interactive will include a PvP mode.</p>
<p>A YouTuber shared a full flick through the book, giving us a detailed dive into the game's various modes and customisations months ahead of Space Marine 2's scheduled release in September 2024.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-metallica-concert-showed-how-sprawling-the-game-has-become.915105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last weekend, Metallica graced the virtual stage in <em>Fortnite</em>, but the event was more than just a heavy metal concert. It was one piece in a weeks-long rollout of modes and content, which really drove home just how large and complex the game has become. The battle royale has steadily morphed into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">an entire ecosystem of games and experiences</a>, and the Metallica crossover might’ve been the most complex to date.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176228/metallica-fortnite-concert">The concert was the showcase moment</a>, and it was like going through an interactive version of heavy metal album art. Players were whisked away in a hot rod to a pyro-heavy concert stage before moving on to a gothic bell tower and a fight with a menacing puppet master. Like past virtual concerts featuring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/2/23978521/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem-chapter-5">Eminem</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a>, it was an attempt to mix the feel of going to a live show with something fantastical. “It couldn’t just be all crazy escapism,” says Daryl Atkins, executive creative director at Magnopus, the studio that designed the experience. “So we plotted a journey that started with the real — and then we went to somewhere impossible.”</p><p>According to Atkins, trying to nail the feel of an authentic live show was the starting point. “They’re not a high concept band like Iron Maiden, with big visuals to draw from that we could translate directly,” he explains. “Metallica are super low-key, it’s all about the music and the performance.” For this reason, the band was involved from the early stages of the design process, which included figuring out the set list and contributing motion capture footage for the developers to work with. The studio pitched the initial idea with concept art, but from there, Magnopus was largely left to figure things out. “We were given a lot of trust,” says Atkins.</p><p>The Metallica event was also an attempt to build on past shows with more interactivity pulled from various <em>Fortnite</em> modes. Players raced around in a car before platforming through the tower, literally riding lightning, and picking up a gun for a boss fight. This led to some design challenges. Unlike in a traditional video game, players couldn’t be left behind or else they’d miss being at the show with everyone else. “We have a dynamic respawning system so that it moves the spawn point with the music,” says creative director Dan Taylor. “So if you die, you respawn at the right point in the track. There are players trailing behind who will be pulled forward, and those who are ahead get pulled back. It balances everything out in a way that’s quite organic.”</p><p>The concert was the centerpiece of a busy period for <em>Fortnite</em>. The game introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163374/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked-battle-pass-fallout-magneto">its current <em>Mad Max</em>-inspired season in May</a>, which teased the band’s appearance. But things really kicked off in earnest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176228/metallica-fortnite-concert">in mid-June</a>, when a Metallica guitar was added as a battle royale weapon, a Metallica-themed race track appeared in <em>Rocket Racing</em>, and the band took over for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a> as the lead act in the music mode <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. After the first concert, Epic launched a new mode called Reload, which had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-new-mode-saw-over-a-million-players-this-weekend">more than 1 million players over the weekend</a>.</p><p>It’s a far cry from the simpler days of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music">Marshmello appearing onstage</a>. <em>Fortnite</em> is a more complex beast now, and every element — whether it’s the appearance of a character or a new mode — seems to be carefully planned. Emily Levy, director of strategic partnerships at Epic, says the goal is “to create moments that feel impactful and meaningful.” The latest concert was similar to how Eminem’s appearance was preceded by the throwback <em>Fortnite</em> OG, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">which lured many lapsed players</a> back. Right now, no moment in <em>Fortnite</em> exists in isolation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="0dJyz6">Jim Henson is known for puppeteering, but to be into film puppeteering at all, you’ve got to be pretty open to out-there filmmaking. It doesn’t get more “out there” than leaping from puppet-driven musical comedies to an original fantasy film where half the cast speaks a constructed language and there are no human characters at all. Yeah, the Skeksis language played so poorly in test screenings that the lines were redubbed in English, but you get the point.</p>
<p id="EBHwuh">The story of Jen the Gelfling’s quest to heal the Dark Crystal and prevent the cruel Skeksis from ruling the world forever was a product of Henson’s post-Muppet ambitions of proving that film puppetry could be a true medium, not merely a novelty. Is <em>The Dark Crystal</em> good? That’s a complicated answer. Is it the product of an incredibly skilled production, led by a once-in-a-generation creative talent, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079265/dark-crystal-labyrinth-bundle-rerelease-jim-henson-cgi">that could not be made today</a>?

<p id="2JetTY"><strong>Director:</strong> Ridley Scott<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright</p>
<p id="TJnMhh"><em>Alien</em>’s greatness probably doesn’t need to be restated. But even if you know how good it is, or think you’ve seen it plenty of times, you probably owe this Ridley Scott masterpiece a rewatch. It’s the kind of movie that miraculously builds on its own legacy with each subsequent viewing, and only grows in impressiveness with each passing year. </p>
<p id="soSpnw">So rewatch <em>Alien </em>again. Compare every element of the movie against something sci-fi films (or any genre, for that matter) have done since, and marvel at how far ahead <em>Alien </em>comes out. In the nearly 45 years since that movie was released, no film has come close to matching how well it communicated the idea of being trapped in space with something more horrible than you knew could exist. No cast has ever had such perfect grizzled-trucker energy or crackly faces. It’s easy to look at movies from the 1970s and say they don’t make ’em today like they used to, and it’s true. But it’s also true that no one before or since has ever made ’em like <em>Alien</em>, and we should all probably appreciate that a little more often than we do. <em>—Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="qAHJLa"><strong>Director:</strong> Ron Howard<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Warwick Davis</p>
<p id="zaetMm">It may seem impossible now, but there was a time when Star Wars was new, and Hollywood was dying to do more stuff like it. Enter George Lucas and his buddy Ron Howard, who said: Let’s do <em>Star Wars </em>for medieval fantasy.</p>
<p id="xxulqW">The result, <em>Willow</em>, is a loosely structured fantasy adventure comedy with cutting-edge special effects that’s fun for the whole family (give or take a couple of black magic scenes that absolutely seared into the brains of young viewers). <em>Star Wars</em>’ Warwick Davis plays the titular hero — a hapless but hopeful basically-a-Hobbit — on a quest to save a baby from an witch, with the help of himbo swordsman Madmartigan, in maybe Val Kilmer’s most delightful role.</p>
<p id="igOg80"><em>Willow</em> is, frankly, phenomenally silly, but also phenomenally fun. There’s a magic wand and a fairy queen and a sorceress who’s been turned into a kind of Australian possum. Give it a watch. <em>—SP </em></p>

<p id="vitrB0"><strong>Director:</strong> Martin Scorsese<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Tadanobu Asano</p>
<p id="xhrOJe">Of all Martin Scorsese’s many terrific films, it’s hard not to feel that his 2016 adaptation of Shūsaku Endō’s novel <em>Silence </em>is one of his most personal and important. The film follows two Jesuit priests, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver), on a mission to find another priest who is said to have renounced his faith in 17th-century Japan. At the time, Christians in the country were largely forced into hiding at the risk of torture and death, making the priests’ journey particularly difficult. </p>
<p id="yQCQMk">While the movie serves as a fascinating look at this period in Japan, it’s even more affecting as a crisis-of-faith movie for Rodrigues. Garfield’s performance is absolutely haunting, as we see Rodrigues slowly lose not just his faith in God, but in everything he’s ever stood for or known himself to be. Garfield communicates all of this pain mostly without dialogue, with a constant war of expressions on his face and in his eyes between his faith and his despair. All of this makes <em>Silence </em>feel like Scorsese’s greatest statement on faith yet — particularly impressive when you consider that he made it in his sixth decade as a filmmaker. <em>—AG</em></p>

<p id="gbYiuC"><strong>Director:</strong> Michael Lehmann<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannen Doherty</p>
<p id="XrLyBN">Michael Lehmann’s classic 1989 dark comedy about solving toxic high school dynamics via murder looks even more arch, mannered, and over the top now than it did back in its day, but it’s still a ridiculously fun movie, full of memorable one-liners, cinematography that pops off the screen, and familiar faces in their very young days. Christian Slater’s career-long Jack Nicholson impression has never been more pronounced than it is here. And after so many years of <em>Stranger Things</em>, it’s fascinating to revisit Winona Ryder from the era where her signature move was blasé teen angst instead of agonized mom angst. The dialogue has aged a bit, but the central conceits — that high school kinda sucked for most of us, and that people tend to be huge hypocrites about how they remember the dead — still land solidly, and with a lot of laughs. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="5qhAVl">If you don’t care about this movie, I don’t care about you. It might be a niche take, but I love an animal movie that doesn’t make the animals talk with weird humanoid lips. <em>Spirit</em> is the story of a wild horse who’s taken into captivity by American settlers in the pre-1900s western U.S., and it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/21540788/horse-girl-canon-movies-books-tv-shows-games">responsible for about one-third of my personality</a>. </p>
<p id="HhC5L1">Voiced by Matt Damon, Spirit is endlessly compassionate and filled with spunk. His journey to try to escape captivity and return to his horse wife is fraught with physical abuse that mirrors the way the settlers abuse the land out west, but Spirit never loses his drive. The film paints the settlers as evil and oppressive, and represents the Lakota man who takes him in as safe and respectful of his wildness — aka, it’s accurate.</p>
<p id="xhS7xk">This movie came out when I was 7 years old, and I remember sitting in the theater, quietly weeping for perhaps the first time in my life. I wasn’t having a meltdown or a temper tantrum. I was going through the very real range of emotions the movie evokes — fear when Spirit gets caught for the first time, rage when he’s branded, excitement when he learns to love riding, deep joy when he’s reunited with his horse baby mama, some blend of grief and anger at the realization that this situation happened to a <em>lot</em> of real-life horses.</p>

<p id="lYrsr2"><strong>Director: </strong>Michael Bay<br><strong>Cast: </strong>John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, Max Martini</p>
<p id="ptxt4l">Michael Bay’s Benghazi movie never really got a fair shake. Around its release, Republican politicians were still using the 2012 Benghazi attacks as a weapon against presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time of the attacks. Because of that, the movie got written off by many due to claims that it was nothing more than Republican propaganda. However, nearly a decade removed from that context, it’s much easier to fit the excellent <em>13 Hours</em> into the larger arc of themes Bay has spent his entire career chasing: Institutions of power care more about rules and norms than they do about human lives, and to save lives, it’s up to individuals to break those rules. </p>
<p id="mobI8k">Beyond the morals of the movie, however, <em>13 Hours</em> is just absolutely terrific, thrilling filmmaking. Bay basically turns the movie into his own personal version of the John Carpenter classic <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em>. What that means in practice is that Bay gives us about 40 minutes of discussion about the politics of Benghazi, the questionable U.S. presence in Libya as a destabilizing force for its government, and the indefensibility of the U.S. bases there. The other 100-ish minutes of the movie’s run time are then dedicated to some of the most expertly filmed firefights ever put on film, where tension comes through in waves and characterization is built beautifully in the brief quiet moments between gunshots. <em>—AG</em></p>

<p id="w3tute"><strong>Director:</strong> Spike Lee<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Danny Aiello, Spike Lee, Giancarlo Esposito</p>
<p id="Rmb9Rr">If you’re American, this movie is required viewing. <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, a Spike Lee joint, makes you feel everything it replicates on screen — the heat collecting on the concrete of a Brooklyn street, the tension between a Black man and his neighborhood racists, the joy of a summer block party with excellent music, the perpetual grief of police violence against Black Americans. </p>
<p id="oLsWSd">It’s no easy watch. The story centers on racial tensions between white police, Italian neighbors, and Black neighbors in 1980s Brooklyn, but the tone isn’t overly serious. Instead, Lee uses moments of humor and joy to underscore the multiple tragedies of the film, and the ending doesn’t tie things up nicely — in fact, it leaves you (or me, a white person) with a pit in your stomach that won’t go away until you start protesting in the streets. And that’s a good thing. After all, the film is (desperately, pleadingly) telling you to do the right thing.</p>
<p id="Br00zv">But there’s a boatload of merit to this film as a film, in addition to its merit as a required text to understanding race relations in the U.S. Like every other Spike Lee movie, the cinematography is unmatched, with his signature high-contrast colors and wacky, wide-lens, canted-angle shots to really capture the vibe of the late ’80s. The acting from Lee himself, Giancarlo Esposito, and Rosie Perez stands out, and the music is legendary —particularly Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power,” which they wrote for the film. <em>—ZH</em></p>

<p id="fsECAg">If you haven’t seen the original 1954 <em>Godzilla</em>, it can be a real surprise how philosophical and principled it is, and how little of it is devoted to a giant rubber-suit monster stomping on Tokyo. (Though there certainly is some of that!) Like so many franchise starters, the first <em>Godzilla</em> is much more complicated and nuanced than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906907/godzilla-apple-tv-show-monarch-monsters-review">most of the followers</a> that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22356658/godzilla-vs-kong-review">focused in on the kaiju fantasy action</a>. It’s well worth watching Ishirō Honda’s classic about war, weapons, humanity, and the price of technological progress, just to see where this story started, realize how it’s mutated, and appreciate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107076/godzilla-american-vs-japanese-movies-interpretations-monsterverse">how different Japan’s version of Godzilla has always been from America’s version</a>. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="xAahw9">Zombies. Trains. South Korean political commentary. What else do you need from a horror-action-thriller?</p>
<p id="V6E2Q9">Unlike <em>Snowpiercer</em>, the <em>other</em> scary train movie out of South Korea, <em>Train to Busan</em> is a really fun watch. That isn’t to say it won’t hit you in the heart, though — the tale follows a frankly shitty father as he attempts to be less of a shitty father by bringing his daughter to see her mother in Busan on her birthday. Unfortunately for them both, a zombie attacks the train and thus begins a zombie apocalypse that plays out within the train cars.</p>
<p id="m3SsdP">It’s a master class in locked-room storytelling, with plenty of the funny and shocking elements that have become endemic to Korean film. Ultimately, you’ll watch the main character grow out of his tendency to disappoint his family. More importantly, you’ll watch him fight a bunch of well-CGI’d zombies. It’s a great first foray into Korean film if you’re new to it, and a classic deserving of endless rewatches if you’ve already seen it. <em>—ZH</em></p>

<p id="yNVByw"><strong>Director:</strong> Greta Gerwig<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts</p>
<p id="Cgyhwb">In the wake of Greta Gerwig’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801761/barbenheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-double-feature-theme-connections">box-office buster</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23799502/barbie-movie-review-margot-robbie-ryan-gosling"><em>Barbie</em></a>, it’s an excellent time to revisit her earlier, more delicately planed, but just as emotionally engaged work — particularly <em>Lady Bird</em>, her coming-of-age movie starring Saoirse Ronan as a teenager trying to find her own identity amid her relationship with her mother. Reading a point-by-point plot summary makes <em>Lady Bird</em> sound mundane and scattershot, but the wistful, sometimes dryly hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking way Ronan plays the title character holds it all together. This one’s a slice of life that feels like real life — and like an arch, straight-faced comedy at the same time. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="3msYXH"><strong>Directors: </strong>Paul Verhoeven<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone</p>
<p id="eWU7Vo">I will <em>never</em> forget the first time I watched <em>Total Recall</em> as a child. The sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s pained expression as he wrenched an oversized tracking device out of his nose canal fascinated me almost as much as the sight of his eyes popping out of his face on Mars haunted my sleepless childhood nights. Its macabre practical special effects aside, <em>Total Recall</em> remains an irrefutable banger of a sci-fi action flick that still holds up more than three decades since it was first released. </p>
<p id="g8LIal">The reality-blurring romp about a salt-of-the-earth construction worker who <em>may</em> or may <em>not</em> be a Martian secret agent is packed to the brim with explosive action sequences, bizarre satirical world-building, and fantastic performances. If you haven’t seen <em>Total Recall</em> yet, don’t worry — you have. You just don’t remember it; you’re actually a Martian secret agent whose mind was erased because you got too close to the truth. This is all a simulation. I’m communicating to you from the real world. I’m just kidding... or am I?<em> —Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="IZfumJ"><strong>Directors: </strong>The Coen brothers<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin</p>
<p id="8SnVOC">My father likes Westerns. A lot. To this day, I’ll often come down the stairs to find him watching some nondescript (to me), old-looking film with two dudes talking like they have something in their mouths and swinging pistols around their fingers. While he succeeded in getting me into horror before the age of 10, I can’t say the same for Westerns — until we found ourselves watching the original 1969 <em>True Grit</em> one evening. </p>
<p id="TJiULI">The story stars a girl — something I’d never seen in any of the John Wayne movies my dad liked — and she was competent, brave, and on a mission to avenge her father’s death. What better movie to watch with your dad?</p>
<p id="WEz23o">Well, the better movie to watch with my dad came out a few years later, when 2010’s <em>True Grit</em> was released. We watched it together as soon as we could, in theaters, and decided it deserved rave reviews. My opinion stands, having rewatched it several times over the last 15 years. The story is the same as the original, but this version has Jeff Bridges instead of John Wayne and a 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld instead of a 21-year-old Kim Darby. Between the more realistic age of the leading actor (the character of Mattie is 14) and the improved cinematography of the remake, the 2010 version of <em>True Grit</em> became one of my favorite movies, and a formative one at that. While the 1969 version is funnier and grittier, the drama of the newer remake is compelling and connected with me, a ’90s baby, in a way the 1969 version connected with my father, a ’60s baby. Both are well worth a watch, and both are free on YouTube. <em>—ZH</em></p>

            <p>Meta is no longer providing bug fixes or security updates the Meta Quest 1 headset.</p>
<p>In a message to Meta Quest 1 players entitled "changes to Quest 1 experience" seen by Eurogamer, the company confirmed that after its decision in January 2023 to stop releasing new features and new Meta Quest apps for Quest 1 on the Quest Store, it was now withdrawing hardware support, too.</p>
<p>It also advised that "if any security vulnerabilities are discovered in the future, private data that is directly stored on the device or accessible from it would be at risk of compromise".</p>

<p>"We'd like to let you know that starting 31st August 2024, we will no longer provide bug fixes or security updates for Meta Quest 1 headsets," the statement, which was sent out today, confirms.</p>
<p>"You will still be able to download new apps and continue using your existing apps as long as they are supported by the developer. However, if any security vulnerabilities are discovered in the future, private data that is directly stored on the device or accessible from it would be at risk of compromise.</p>
<p>"This update follows our announcement in January 2023, when we stopped releasing new features and new Meta Quest apps for Quest 1 on the Quest Store.</p>
<p>"We're excited about the future of Meta Quest and looking forward to providing you with more groundbreaking MR experiences."</p>
<p>The statement closed on inviting players to contact Meta Store Support if they have any further "general enquiries".</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beat-saber-support-on-meta-quest-1-vr-headsets-ending-this-year">last month Beat Saber also revealed it would no longer be supported on Meta Quest 1 VR headsets</a>.</p>
<p>According to an FAQ on the game's website, the developer is aiming to "raise the bar of what's possible", meaning it will focus on more recent and powerful devices instead.</p>
<p>Beat Saber will remain playable on Meta Quest 1 devices, but from 2nd November support will end. This means no multiplayer or leaderboard functionality, and no further updates, although the game will remain accessible.</p>

			<p>Techland has announced the release of the Tower Raid Open Beta for Dying Light 2 with game update 1.17. The Tower Raid introduces a brand new co-op experience to the first-person action/adventure zombie game, inspired by the VNC Tower mission from the campaign.</p>
<p>The objective is simple: reach the top and grab the special loot waiting for you. Each time, you’ll have to traverse different floor combinations with different obstacles and goals. To additionally<br>
spice things up, there are different modifiers for each run. They will affect (positively or negatively) the player, the enemies, or even both.</p>
<p>The Tower Raid can be started via Jai's Board, which can be unlocked through the side quest “Lost Armory” (available automatically once you reach the Central Loop). When the Tower Raid is started, you (and your friends if you’re playing in co-op, which is highly recommended by Techland) are spawned inside the lobby of the Tower. This Dying Light 2 adventure will take you from the ground floor all the way to the roof, provided that you can defeat all foes. It's up to you how you deal with various encounters and if you search each floor for loot.</p>
<p>For the activity's completion, you will be rewarded with Jai's Reputation Points and Tokens, which can be used to buy new stuff from him (including the Tower Raid chest). Moreover, on top of the Tower, you'll find an Airdrop that contains a large amount of loot and an Exotic Weapon. Additionally, when you complete the Tower Raid for the first time each week, you’ll get bonus<br>
Reputation Points and Tokens.</p>
<p>The Tower Raid Open Beta will last until July 18. Next week, Techland will introduce a new Elite mode difficulty, which enables harder enemies and activates tactical stamina but provides better rewards. The update will also add three new floors, ten new modifiers, and four new rewards. On the third and last week, the developers will add another seven modifiers, three new rewards, and double Jai's Reputation Points gains when completing the mode.</p>

			<p>A new&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid Delta vs Metal Gear Solid 3 comparison video has been released, showing the massive upgrades players can expect from the remake.</p>
<p>Konami debuted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-new-trailer-provides-an-impressive-new-look-at-the-boss-more-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trailer for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> during Microsoft's Xbox showcase earlier this month.
