            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/death-stranding-just-sauntered-onto-xbox-series-xs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In a surprise celebration of the game’s fifth anniversary, Kojima Productions and 505 Games have just dropped <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding">Death Stranding Director’s Cut</a> onto Xbox Series X|S and Amazon Luna.</p>
<p>Having originally launched as a PlayStation 4 exclusive published by Sony, and with the sequel set to be similarly PlayStation 5 exclusive, Hideo Kojima’s genre-bending game is now on Xbox. The studio has also confirmed that they now have full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>


<p dir="ltr"><span>Hideo Kojima said, “It is my pleasure to finally announce that Death Stranding Director’s Cut will be delivered to Xbox players. I would like to thank all the fans who have stayed connected with us as well as everyone in the Xbox community who have been patiently waiting. Kojima Productions will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The production of Death Stranding seems to have been about as unique and individual as Kojima’s career as a gaming auteur. Having been given the boot by Konami following the release of Metal Gear Solid V, Kojima founded his own game studio, doing so with the backing of a very enthusiastic Andrew House and Sony, who secured the company’s next game as an exclusive – this turned out to be Death Stranding in 2019 – and helped them get access to Guerrilla Games’ Decima engine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it seems there was a good bit of wiggle room in that publishing partnership. While Sony had exclusive console rights, Kojima was also able to sign with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">505 Games to publish the game on PC in mid-2020</a>. Come 2021, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/23/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-is-it-an-essential-upgrade-for-ps5/">PS5 enhanced Director’s Cut</a> launched and was then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/28/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-date-30-march-paid-upgrade-option-revealed/">similarly followed on for PC</a>, and they took a further opportunity to bring the game to Mac, iPad and iPhone in early 2024.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, it seems that the publishing deal was for five years with the IP rights reverting back to Kojima after that time.&nbsp;In porting the game across to Xbox, we’re now in a curious place where the excellent Decima engine is now on Xbox as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, what does this mean for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>? Well, likely a similar situation to the first game. Death Stranding 2 is being published by Sony, which means that there will at the very least be console exclusivity for a good few years after launch. It remains to be seen whether 505 will be involved again and help bring the game to PC and other platforms down the line.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-revealed-coming-out-in-2025/">Death Stranding 2 is expected to launch in 2025 for PS5</a>.</p>

			<p>Fatshark has officially announced that Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will be coming to PS5 on December 3. The game will only be available digitally, and pre-orders are open for those who want to purchase the title. Additionally, for those who pre-order the Imperial Edition, you'll be eligible to play the game six days early. To celebrate the news today released by Fatshark, there is a PS5 trailer to get those who use the console excited for the incoming Warhammer 40,000 title.</p>
<p>For those eyeing up the title release on PS5, you'll be able to purchase the Standard Edition of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide from the PlayStation Store for $39.99. If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you'll get a 10% discount on the Standard Edition and a 15% discount on the Imperial Edition of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Coming to PS5 December 3 | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_XqYUfiY7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since Warhammer 40,000: Darktide has been out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a> for a while, the PS5 version of the game will come with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-released-a-day-early/">all content</a> and improvements that have been made since the game first launched on PC and will also be enhanced for the PS5 Pro. This means that the game will be coming with DualSense Haptic Feedback and 4K60FPS on the PS5 Pro. The performance mode will see the game run in 60FPS on a 1440 resolution and the game run in 4K30 in quality mode for the original PS5.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide was originally released in November 2022 as a spiritual successor to the Vermintide series. Last year saw the game release on Xbox Series X|S during October. It's quite a surprise that the PlayStation is the last console to see the title released, but the game also went through a lot of hardships during development. The title was first announced in July 2020 during an Xbox Series X|S showcase event, with the game having a planned release in 2021. However, during this time, the COVID-19 pandemic had started, which caused a global shift in how work was tackled, as a lot of companies would now have to hire employees to work remotely or halt production altogether.</p>
<p>During this time, the game experienced several delays, and was then officially released on 30 November, 2022. It was then announced in August 2023 that the game would be released on Xbox before it actually released in October, bringing us to the current day of the game being released in December 2024 for PS5 and also being PS5 Pro enhanced.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is a hefty list of PS5 Pro enhanced games that will be available either when the console launches, or when the game is officially released, and the list is currently over 80+ games.</p>

            <p>Back in the mists of 2021, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effects-normandy-sr1is-in-no-mans-sky-now">No Man's Sky revealed its very own Normandy SR1 space frigate</a>. "The Normandy in No Man's Sky?" you cry. "Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a pilotable version in their own space sim.</p>
<p>"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!</p><!--more-->

<p>That's not all they're adding in the latest updates. No Man's Sky now supports cross-save, albeit in limited beta form to begin with. At last, you will be able to transfer all of your console saves to PC, where they belong. Here's some blurb - it sounds like implementing the feature has been atypically tricky.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man's Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.</p>
<p>It's very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn't even exist back then!</p>
<p>For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over 6 months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all No Man's Sky players can connect their different platform accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will then be admitted to the beta. Participants in the beta will be able to upload and download saves from any connected platform, via the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Find the full bulletin about the Normandy/cross-save update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">here</a>. Of course, all this invites the question of when we'll hear more about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. Bioware released an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-release-new-mass-effect-5-epsilon-trailer-while-hinting-about-mass-effect-3-connections">"Epsilon" teaser trailer</a> on N7 Day last year, but the word is they're having a quieter one this year, presumably to avoid stealing any thunder from the recently launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-game-director-talks-inspiration-the-sims-the-life-simulator-genre-appealing-to-the-west-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The life simulator genre is full of some of the most creative and passionate gamers in the world. For years, the space has been dominated by EA and The Sims with other companies trying to provide an alternative to what’s offered. Korean studio Krafton is the latest to attempt to enter the market with inZOI, a life simulation game “where the player can alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences.”</p>



<p>Recently, I was able to sit down with director and producer Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim to talk about the game’s development, the response to the character creator over the summer, competing with The Sims, and more. </p>



<p>The game is set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enter Early Access</a> on March 28, 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>. Over the summer, the studio released a demo for its character creator that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-character-creator-shows-players-are-ready-for-sims-competitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100,000 custom characters</a> created and shared worldwide.</p>



<p>You can read the full interview below. The quotes come via an on-site interpreter from the interview.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>I really want to start with talking about the character creator because that was a massive hit with thousands of people playing it, thousands of people showing their creations.&nbsp;What were your thoughts on seeing that type of response to not even playing the game, just seeing people create their characters for the game?</strong></p>



<p>The reason why we prepared this strategy of launching a character creation demo along this Gamescom period was that we hoped that people would like it.&nbsp;There were some demands from the community saying that they would at least like to get a taste of inZoi because it’s still far away as to getting the full hands-on experience.&nbsp;We wanted to try to provide as much as we can, but we were also worried at the same time because everything is still in development.</p>



<p>It’s not the polished, complete product.&nbsp;As developers, we always worry about not showing the best possible version of what we’re trying to create.&nbsp;Moreover, the thing that we really wanted to achieve was not people just creating the characters within that demo and just calling it a day, but we wanted people to share those creations with others.</p>



<p>I’m sure because you covered this demo, you’re aware of the Canvas aspect of the demo where you have to upload it, and then your creation gets seen by other users who are playing the demo alongside you all around the world.&nbsp;They get to download it and once again enjoy your creation in the same way.&nbsp;He was hoping that would be the final step that everyone would like to take, and thankfully that became the case.</p>



<p>We reached really high numbers of shared creations on Canvas, so we were really happy about that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>The space has been owned by The Sims for 20 years at this point.&nbsp;People are looking for something new, they thought they were going to get it with Life by You from Paradox.&nbsp;That ultimately, for whatever reason, fell apart, cancelled, and now people are spotting inZOI and they really think this could be the next big challenger to give them an alternative.</strong> <strong>Does that put any added pressure on you as a team?</strong></p>



<p>Well, it does add a lot of pressure because when the attention is kind of sparse, it’s a little easy to take the little chunk of the pie and say we did our part and there you go.&nbsp;But we do realize that the attention has been sharply directed towards us because of those cancellations of Life by You and other projects not coming to life quite yet.&nbsp;But the thing that he wants is not to really take over the genre in any way, but just to think that he wants to co-exist with the other games that are within this space.</p>



<p>So I think being as a player too, we just want to have many options to kind of dive into.&nbsp;So if we want to play a game like The Sims, we can do that.&nbsp;But if we want an experience to enjoy every now and then, we can do that too.</p>



<p>So from a player’s perspective, that’s kind of how it feels.&nbsp;From a developer standpoint, the life simulation genre, coming from an MMO and mostly the RPG genre, creating this vast world and thinking that life simulation is a small little space, how difficult could it be?&nbsp;So at the start, it was pretty easy strolling.</p>



<p>But as soon as it got to the depths and the nuances and all the intricacies of what life simulation genre ultimately turned out to be, it turned out to be a really, really difficult genre to continue developing.&nbsp;So we’ve always expressed many respects to previous developers who kind of worked on that same genre.</p>



<p>W<strong>hat’s the feeling on where things stand right now with the development of the game?&nbsp;Obviously, we’re still a way away from a full release and everybody getting their hands on, but if you were to put just a feeling today of where things stand, what would that be?</strong></p>



<p>He’s [Kim] really never satisfied.&nbsp;And the real reason why he explained that was because as a longtime player to Sins, he has this inner expectations of what this game is supposed to be.&nbsp;And truth be told, the excuse of we’re still developing, we’re not there yet, and we still haven’t released.</p>



<p>To him, that’s an excuse because all he sees is a game that’s very, very incomplete and very, very far away from what he ideally wants this game to be in terms of an experience standpoint.&nbsp;And because him talking about coexisting with the Sins in a way to be another fun option for live simulation players, he really wants to have this dedication to continue developing this game to be better and better, even after our eventual early access launch to never really be satisfied, but also to, in that same way, use that as a positive reinforcement to making the game better all the time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>If it’s going to coexist with the sims on the market, there’s got to be a big reason to give it a shot.&nbsp;Obviously, the visual fidelity of the game, the character models look fantastic, the visuals just look great.&nbsp;But what would be, what’s the gameplay aspect you’re really hoping will get players to give inZOI a shot?</strong></p>



<p>here are some beyond the often realistic moments that are provided by the sims.&nbsp;There are a lot of diving into the fantastical elements, where you’re talking about ghosts and you’re talking about all these different fantasy characters that you can be in the sims.&nbsp;But that’s where I think he believes that the inZOI does differ quite heavily from what the direction that the sims is trying to provide in terms of experience.</p>



<p>Because we’re trying to provide a little bit more of a realistic experience.&nbsp;Those kind of ordinary life moments that we kind of feel as we live our own lives, that those little moments where it has bigger meanings than what it initially seemed out to be.&nbsp;Those are kind of things that he wants to express so that when people get into the game and get into this world that we’ve provided, people will feel those very unique moments of life.</p>



<p>And be able to recreate that through a video game that we’re calling inZOI.&nbsp;To have a more of a second realistic experience, but through a video game media is what he’s hoping to accomplish.&nbsp;So that when people want the imaginary fantasy elements from the sims, but just kind of want to maybe chill down a little bit and calm down and maybe enjoy the kind of a replication of realistic life.</p>



<p>And then they can kind of relate back to inZOI at that moment.&nbsp;So that’s kind of the whole reason why him and the entire project is kind of pushing towards this descriptor of our game to be called a realistic life simulation more than anything else.&nbsp;I mean, just he wants to put out some examples as something that he really wants to work on is that, you know, relationships, especially romantic relationships, they’re not always easy.</p>



<p>And in video games, it kind of makes us feel like they’re easier than what they actually are in real life.&nbsp;So he wants to try to replicate that as accurately from his knowledge as possible to kind of let people experience that, you know, the reality of developing relationship is not always fun and roses.&nbsp;This is sometimes difficult, sometimes painful.</p>



<p>And there are some, you know, these mixed emotions that kind of go along with that.&nbsp;And he hopes that people will be able to experience that, you know, through a video game like inZOI.&nbsp;And another example is, you know, kind of relating to that, like, let’s say you get into a divorce, right?</p>



<p>It’s not saying, you know, you just put a paper and you’re just done with it and no emotions are exchanged.&nbsp;There’s a lot of emotions that are exchanged between that.&nbsp;And also, you know, realistic things like how do you split the finances of the husband and wife?</p>



<p>And sometimes, you know, it doesn’t feel fair as to how the results come out after a long series of arguments.&nbsp;Those kind of instances where, you know, just because it’s a video game, you think it would logically give you the result that you’re expecting.&nbsp;But, you know, having those unexpected moments where sometimes, you know, this is not the correct calculation, as one might say, but still that could, you know, it could trigger a type of emotion that is pretty unique to have in a video game is what he wants.</p>



<p>And he already mentioned visual, but he wants to kind of elaborate just as simply, just very basically on that.&nbsp;Because he believes there’s a need for people to be creators.&nbsp;But, you know, in our modern technology field world, you need a very high skill gap in terms of being able to create as much as you can imagine in your head.</p>



<p>But he hopes to provide more tools that are more intuitive, that are easier to use so that you can, you know, be a creator and recreate things that are in your mind, but just kind of visualize it in the game.&nbsp;And one of the example is, you know, being able to kind of sync your iPhone into the game and then you do a whole facial tracking where we have so many points where just follow every little movement of your face and that gets mirrored into your character’s face.&nbsp;And that he thought that that would be a good use for, you know, VTubers nowadays who are really into that space and just kind of create an inZOI character and just sync your iPhone.</p>



<p>And there you already have a full on VTuber experience that you can create really, really easily through the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>You talked about developing, like the difference between developing for Korean audiences versus a more global audience.&nbsp;Has there been any obstacles or what have been like any sort of obstacles that have gotten in the way to make sure that you’re building something for a much larger player base?</strong></p>



<p>He [Kim] definitely felt a lot of difficulties with that from the start because he understood that, you know, when some games, when created by certain regions, but aren’t able to reach other regions because of that, lack of cultural understanding and the things that people will perceive.</p>



<p>It’s already been a proven fact that if you don’t work on this extensively as someone who doesn’t know the cultures of the other audience that you’re trying to reach, it just doesn’t turn out to be a success.&nbsp;So he knew that from the start and very proactively, he tried to reach out to a lot of our offices beyond Korea.&nbsp;So we have offices in America, offices in Europe, and where we try to gather information and insights and feedback from when we show our development stages of the games.</p>



<p>What do you think about this?&nbsp;What does this look like?&nbsp;Is there anything awkward about this?</p>



<p>So always that back and forth Q&amp;As did happen because of that reason.&nbsp;And he felt like that was very, very helpful for him.&nbsp;And kind of extending to that, he also hired foreign employees into our project where initially it was just all Koreans, right? Mostly people who always worked here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So he felt the need to hire foreign individuals to have a little more deeper insight into very little details of the games because he felt like those were going to be what separates us in terms of games that do not try as hard to achieve that aspect of it.</p>



<p><strong>Why is the game named inZOI? Is there a reason behind the name?</strong></p>



<p>So the keyword from that, as you might expect, is the word zoi.&nbsp;And for him, while he was searching through so many different words and keywords to base this game name off of, that word zoi really stuck with him.&nbsp;So it’s originally a Greek word that means “life”.</p>



<p>But as you know, with being a journalist, so many words and terminologies change over time because of culture differences and evolution and how people want to express different things.&nbsp;But the unique thing about that word ZOE from a Greek perspective is that that word has stayed true to its meaning for over a thousand years.&nbsp;And that purity aspect and that really, I guess, very enduring aspect of what that word kind of represents was something that he really related to.</p>



<p>And as he was essentially creating a life simulation game, he didn’t want it to be just kind of an external simulation where it’s not really real, but it’s trying to be life.&nbsp;But he really wanted to create a game where it makes you feel like you can really live out life.&nbsp;That’s why he’s adding all those not so positive elements to the game to hopefully to provide a good balance that he believes that ultimately provides the most satisfaction of playing a game where it’s not all just, you know, happiness and good things happen.</p>



<p>But, you know, those mixtures of unfortunate and unexpected events, when they do happen, when you put it all together, it creates this really magical thing that he believes provides the most satisfaction.&nbsp;So to say it’s an in-ZOE is that you’re in a way you’re in the life.&nbsp;In the life, you’re really living and recreating and reliving life through this video game is what we also want to represent.</p>



<p>But also at the same time, as the entire work kind of depicts, he wants players to, in the end, just kind of enjoy life through this game.&nbsp;Because, you know, by experiencing all these different elements, different aspects of life and kind of experiencing them through the game, he feels like you can have a better appreciation of life, of the life that you’re actually living yourself.&nbsp;But you can do that as kind of a segue through the video game.</p>



<p>And hopefully that’s what he hopes to achieve through this game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>So is there anything that you’ve taken away from the feedback from the character creator, or maybe through talking to people, whether it was at Gamescom or elsewhere, about what maybe can change in order to get a hold of the North American market compared to other areas?</strong></p>



<p>So before he elaborates on what he thinks he should do for the game to kind of reach the market, he sees kind of the North American market as not just a large chunk of the pie in general, but because this is a live simulation game where historically, North American players have been playing the game for a long time.&nbsp;So North American players were very attached to this genre more than other regions.&nbsp;So he felt like because of that reason, it’s a very, very important market for inZOI as well.</p>



<p>But with that said, even through all this feedback that he’d gotten and all the responses that he got at games come offline and online through all the comments and feedback from influencers and the viewers of the influencers altogether, he still feels like he doesn’t want to jump to conclusions as to what that solution will be.&nbsp;And he doesn’t want to assume that he knows the answer to everything at the moment, because he feels like he’s always taking this, because I’m speaking for him, this humble stance of really not knowing and not being certain that you know everything, but to always use that attitude to continue to listen to players and continue to communicate as directly as we possibly can to really find out what is it that they want from the game.&nbsp;What should be improved so that it becomes more relatable, more familiar, and essentially more fun in the end in terms of that experience.</p>



<p>So it will be a continual progress because as he thought from the beginning of development that this was going to be a huge assignment for him to completely understand the cultural differences between Korean culture and the Western culture.&nbsp;It’s an assignment that he’s going to be still continuing to be working very vigorously on.</p>



<p>Just kind of one funny example of one of the first things that he realized as he was discussing the cultural differences between Korean and Western cultures that, you know, when you have a sofa, right?&nbsp;When you have a sofa and people typically sit on the sofa, right?&nbsp;That’s understood, right?</p>



<p>That’s probably why the thing was made.&nbsp;But it’s so common in Korea for people to sit on the floor, leaning their back on the leg of the sofa.&nbsp;It’s such a common thing in Korea that he didn’t think twice about, you know, because we have another map called Bliss Bay, where it’s supposed to be a replication of the United States.</p>



<p>And when he actually added that feature to a household where, you know, the people in Bliss Bay sit on the front of the sofa, leaning their back on the legs of the sofa rather than sitting on it.&nbsp;He didn’t realize at the time that that was such an awkward, you know, visually awkward situation from an American standpoint.&nbsp;So, you know, simple things like that, while he thought, you know, we can only assume that because it’s so common in Korea, everybody else around the world does it.</p>



<p>But that’s why he another reason that you can’t just assume that everything he knows is the answer.&nbsp;So he’s going to take that humble act to keep on communicating to find out what the answer is.</p>

Players can play from the comfort of their sofa on console, continue an Expedition on the move with Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their beefy PC rig, and view it in incredibly immersive Virtual Reality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save between a huge number of platforms including PC, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 and 2, and PCVR.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man’s Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for,” Hello Games continued. “Both those numbers are large for our tiny team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over six months. We are now ready to start rolling cross-save out to a small number of players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From today, No Man’s Sky all players can link their different accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will be enabled to then select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks all players will be invited to do so, Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to today’s launch of PS5 Pro and No Man’s Sky’s support for the $700 mid-gen upgrade, Hello Games said users can expect PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) to provide 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. No Man's Sky is also an early supporter of 8K resolution, running at 30 frames per second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out No Man’s Sky running on PS5 Pro in the video below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As well as a much sharper resolution at higher framerates, the increased power of the PS5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board,” Hello Games explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players on PS5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. Explore the most beautiful and detailed alien worlds No Man's Sky has to offer, for the first time on console.” All these improvements are also coming to PSVR2, Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Normandy from Mass Effect returns to No Man’s Sky as part of BioWare's N7 Day celebrations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was back in 2021 that the Normandy made its first appearance in one of the first expeditions we ever ran,” Hello Games said. “The limited-time expedition starts today, runs for two weeks and culminates in players being able to claim the Normandy for their fleet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the intervening years since that event, we have welcomed a huge number of Travellers, not least a whole new cohort of Switch players and an increasingly large number of Chinese fans. Many of these new players have envied those who proudly displayed their Normandy in their frigate collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mass Effect fans know that this legendary freighter only appears when it is most needed! Today, and for the next two weeks, as a love-letter from one science fiction game to another, we are giving everyone another chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Huge thanks to our friends at EA and Bioware for helping make this happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky"><u>No Man's Sky</u></a> launched in 2016 initially for PC and PS4 before coming out on Xbox One in 2018, and PS5 and Xbox Series X and S in 2020. A Nintendo Switch version followed in 2022. Over the years, Hello Games has issued a long list of major updates that have continued to boost player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, it's a busy time for Hello Games, which alongside updates for No Man’s Sky is working on its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Image credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think I am a pretty ordinary person," Miyamoto said. "If possible, I’d prefer not to work at all, but if I’m going to work, I want to do so as efficiently as possible. I’m always thinking about how to make what I’m working on a hit, because If I make a hit, this makes my next job easier. I talk about these creative dilemmas at the [new employee] seminar every year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto expanded a little by explaining what this seminar entails, as it reflects his own philosophy for game development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Among the game developers who have just joined Nintendo, many of them often play games themselves, and their thinking is that they want to create a fancier version of the last game that they played." he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, I explain to them that game design is not about this. It is about looking at the things around you and putting together the aspects that you think would be interesting in a video game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's these ideas that led Miyamoto to develop some of the most beloved video games of all time such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario 64, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is of course on the cusp of announcing its Switch successor, which Miyamoto will have been heavily involved in creating. Little is known about the console, but this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">Nintendo confirmed it is backwards compatible with Switch games</a>, and Nintendo Switch Online carries forward.

Discovery has admitted, contributing to a further $100 million writedown for the company’s games business in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition">Warner Bros. Games acquired MultiVersus developer Player First Games</a> in July just two months after the game relaunched on PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S following early access and open beta releases throughout 2022 and 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said at the time. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking in a recent financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav and Chief Financial Officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said MultiVersus' failure had added another $100 million to the $200 million writedown the company's games business had already suffered earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games' only new game release during the third quarter of 2024 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"... we recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now," Zaslav said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wiedenfels added more detail: "We took another $100 million plus impairment due to the underperforming releases, primarily MultiVersus this quarter, bringing total writedown year-to-date to over $300 million in our games business, a key factor in this year’s studio profit decline."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, at the time of this article’s publication MultiVersus had just 686 concurrent players, with a 24-hour peak of 1,741 concurrent players. MultiVersus’ all-time peak of 153,433 concurrent players was set over two years ago, before the game was pulled offline and overhauled. Microsoft and Sony do not make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this all means for MultiVersus remains to be seen, but earlier this year, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">Warner Bros. admitted the failure of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League contributed to a $200 million hit to revenue</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-reportedly-scaled-back-at-rocksteady-following-disastrous-launch">post-launch plans were reportedly scaled back,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">layoffs were reported</a>. Season 4 launches on November 12 and ends January 21, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games revenue declined 31% during the most recent financial quarter (July to September), primarily driven by the better performance of the prior year slate, mainly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, compared to the current year slate, Warner Bros. said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the current quarter (October to December), Warner Bros. expects games to be flat to moderately better year-on-year, as last year’s launch of Hogwarts Legacy on Switch in November will be offset by lower costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Warner Bros. said it’s now doubling down on four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines">a sequel is already in the works</a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman," Zaslav said. Warner Bros. recently published VR game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> exclusively on the Meta Quest 3, and has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While Fortnite has turned into a bigger platform for a host of games--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-is-a-new-survival-crafting-game-coming-to-fortnite-on-december-7/1100-6519636/" data-ref-id="1100-6519636">Fortnite Festival and Lego Fortnite, for example</a>--Take-Two isn't necessarily going all in on that strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's too early to say that, 'OK, our future is paid minigames inside bigger platform-type games.' But I think it's a reflection of the fact that our creative teams are open-minded and are willing to try new things and aren't being precious about the IP that they create," Zelnick said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Take-Two CEO had a lot to say on the earnings call, not just related to NBA 2K25.

                <p dir="ltr">Season 1 arrives in Call of Duty on November 14, and the big update will finally integrate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. A new Warzone trailer has released to show off some of the Season 1 content, including plenty of vehicular combat on the new Area 99 Resurgence map.</p><p dir="ltr">Fitting for the '90s setting of Black Ops 6, the Season 1 trailer opens with The Offspring's classic hit "Come Out and Play." The gameplay is featured on the upcoming Area 99 Resurgence map, which Treyarch has described as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cod-warzone-map-area-99-is-where-nuketown-was-born/1100-6526171/">the birthplace of Nuketown</a>. The action reveals the map will also feature helicopters, dirt bikes, and four-wheelers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8vuGF6g2TI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s8vuGF6g2TI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For hints of Season 1 content, several operator skins and weapon blueprints are teases. Sevati Dumas is featured with a new operator skin that gives her an edgy look, as she's glammed up with pink hair, chains, and tattoos. Maya from Zombies also has a new skin, plus there are several masked operator skins shown off, including a soldier in studded leather biker gear.</p><p dir="ltr">A C9 submachine blueprint is revealed, which features an illustrated image of an angry fox. The trailer also hints at a sniper rifle that looks much like the popular Barrett .50 Cal from the original Modern Warfare 2. It's uncertain if this will be one of the new DLC weapons in Season 1, or if this is a weapon blueprint that turns an existing sniper into a cosmetic variant of the weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 is set to integrate all of Black Ops 6's content into Warzone. This includes the game's weapon pool, operators, and Treyarch's new omnimovement mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6 and Warzone, here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/">everything announced for Season 1</a> so far, including new multiplayer maps and Zombies content.

            <p>Larian has shared some details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s PS5 Pro upgrade.</p>
<p>Those in possession of both a PlayStation 5 Pro and Baldur's Gate 3 will see the game's Quality mode can now run at native 4K (2160p), with 30fps. Its Performance mode, meanwhile, has been upscaled from 1440p to 2160p, with 60fps.</p>
<p>These adjustments, Larian said, will allow players to "achieve crisp console visuals without sacrificing smooth performance".</p>

<p>The developer added split screen gameplay on the PS5 Pro will now offer either 30fps or 60fps. The frame rate will depend on whether a player has opted for Quality or Performance mode.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, the developer has also issued a PS5 fix for that bug which prevented players from downloading or subscribing to mods when loading into another player's multiplayer game with mods enabled.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, PlayStation platform business group CEO Hideaki Nishino revealed Sony was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-was-already-working-on-ps5-pro-before-playstation-5-launch">working on its PS5 Pro console even before it released the base PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>And now, it is here. The digital-only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro arrived today</a>, costing £699.99/$699.99. It includes a 2TB SSD, a DualSense wireless controller and - as the PS5 did - a copy of Astro's Playroom pre-installed. As a general point, you will need to buy the vertical stand separately (£24.99). The separate disc drive is also compatible, and costs an additional £99.99. If you want to purchase everything, you are looking at a total of £825.</p>

			<p>Stellar Blade received a new update today that introduces support for PlayStation 5 Pro and two new graphic options that take advantage of the console's increased specs and new features to deliver an enhanced experience.</p>
<p>The new update introduces the PS5 Pro's exclusive Pro and Pro Max enhanced graphic options, which allow for enhanced image quality and better performance than on the base model. On X, the developer shared a quick comparison video showcasing how Pro Max mode improves image quality and performance over the base model's Priority Resolution mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🔶New update details!</p>
<p>🔸 Stellar Blade also supports enhanced graphics on PLAYSTATION 5 Pro!<br>
🔸 Pro and Pro Max, enhanced graphic options are available on PlayStation 5 Pro.<br>
🔸 HFR is available on Pro and Pro Max graphic options.</p>
<p>🔸Various other bug fixes.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StellarBlade?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StellarBlade</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PS5</a>… <a href="https://t.co/jc9sCLVuV5">pic.twitter.com/jc9sCLVuV5</a></p>
<p>— StellarBlade (@StellarBlade) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Stellar Blade is among the best games released on PlayStation 5 this year. Despite some minor issues, the game developed by Shift Up is an impressive action role-playing game that is worth experiencing by all fans of the genre, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-to-impose-100-hour-monthly-playtime-limit-in-2025.1029843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that streaming service GeForce Now will begin imposing monthly playtime limits on new subscribers to two of its three currently available tiers, starting from next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit update</a>, Nvidia says it's renaming its Priority subscription tier to Performance, and that new subscribers to both the Performance and Ultimate tiers will be limited to 100 hours per month of playtime beginning "at the start of next year".</p>

<p>If you're an existing Performance or Ultimate member on or before December 31st this year, then you won't start seeing the monthly limits kick in until January 2026, which Nvidia says is a gift "to thank the GeForce Now community for joining the cloud gaming revolution".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geforce-now-monthly-limits-tiers.jpg?itok=SXoZq7YD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geforce-now-monthly-limits-tiers.jpg?itok=ZYJCMz87 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GeForce Now is changing in some pretty big ways next year.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nvidia, the new limit "comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe", although the company doesn't provide any further info about exactly how long people mostly use the service for each month.</p>

<p>You'll be able to buy extra hours if you run over the limit, too; $2.99 will get you 15 more hours on the Performance tier, while you'll have to pay $5.99 for the same privilege if you're on the Ultimate tier, although naturally, the quality of your streaming is better on this tier.</p>

<p>In addition, up to 15 hours of unused playtime will roll over each month, so if you do find yourself going under the limit for one month, you'll be able to enjoy an equivalent amount of extra time the following month.</p>

<p>On the plus side, Performance members will be able to enjoy 1440p gaming instead of 1080p, and the tier is also getting access to ultrawide support, although 4K and 120fps remains reserved for Ultimate members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-limit-october-games.jpg?itok=O4VP4IoF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-limit-october-games.jpg?itok=z8KvzP6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games, including recent releases like&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, are available to stream via GeForce Now.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what GeForce Now is, it's a cloud gaming service that allows you to stream and play PC games on a range of devices via the cloud. It's similar to services like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-available-now-on-xbox-series-xs-and-xbox-one">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-announced-as-new-cloud-gaming-service-in-early-access">Amazon Luna</a>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for the service over on the official GeForce Now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> if you're interested.</p>

            <p>Got an email about this. Looks cool. Is free. “I’ll write about that,” I thought. “I’ll write about that for Rock Paper Shotgun, a place that semi-regularly posts articles about cool and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> games.” So here we are. If you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop, assuming the only reason I’d open an article in a superfluous and straightforward manner is because I’m about to deliver some sort of third sentence twist, you’re completely wrong! There’s no twist at all. I’m simply going to deliver some information about the game in a neutral tone. You can find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ved-purification">VED: Purificatio</a>n, a free prologue demo to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> VED, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190370/VED_Purification/?curator_clanid=45226842">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, here’s a non-neutral assessment: the voice acting is as rough as the cheap Asda cat litter I bought that was so close to gravel in consistency that I refused to subject my pet to it, so that’s bonus points to the art for carrying my interest. This one’s a turn-based RPG, but with cRPG elements like dialogue choices, multiple endings, and a series of intriguing ‘curses or blessings’, which sound somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>-like. There’s dice rolls and ability loadouts, and most importantly, the gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182420/VED/">Steam page</a> for the main game feature at least one very good giant mushroom bastard. Here’s how the game describes itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>In VED, you take on the role of Cyrus, a young hero who comes to the city of Micropolis in search of a new life. There he suddenly discovers the ability to teleport between two interconnected worlds full of mysterious flying islands, strange creatures, and dangerous monsters. Unfold an interactive story where each decision matters and help Cyrus discover the truth about this magical place, so that you can decide the fate of two worlds. To succeed in your quest, you will have to master the powerful magic of the Veds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just once, I would like a game to just come out and tell me in the marketing that “only about one third of the decisions you make matter”. Would you not just buy that game immediately, purely out of respect for its honesty? I would. I haven’t played VED of course, so maybe each decision does matter, and maybe “easy to learn but difficult to master” is an accurate description of the combat, too. Who knows! The full game’s out in a week anyway. That’s the 14th of November, and your prologue progress carries over to the big release, should you find yourself a dedicated VEDhead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When multiplayer fishing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> came out last month, it offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs</a>. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

<p>That's in-game money, of course, earned by selling your catch. Not actual human dollars. But it's still a comically large price tag when compared to the other titles in the game, which generally cost $75. To declare your heterosexuality is now the most expensive thing you can do in the game. Nevertheless, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625852883021083340/">complaint from a bitter user</a> on Steam demanded a "straight" title, and that is what they got. What's funnier is that the title comes in quotemarks. So you're not straight, you're "straight". </p>
<p>I'm straight. I also find this incredibly funny. As a glib response to a bad faith complaint, it's perfect. Meanwhile, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625853246786774999/">another player asked</a> if non-binary items of clothing would make an appearance. In that case, a non-binary title and an accompanying t-shirt were simply added to the game. </p>
<p>All these additions come as part of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3146520/view/4467101633890746444">big "housecleaning" patch</a> that fixes bugs and adds other features. Other titles now available  include "creature" and "cryptid". I'm currently sporting "critter". </p>
<p>Plenty of non-cosmetic changes have been made too. Fishing on ripples in the water now gives you a larger chance of catching better fish. There are multiple save files now, meaning you can rock more than one avatar. Some items can be stacked up to 99. The inventory menus have been reworked. One note in the changelog simply says: "Added the ???????? which is accessed through the ???? ?????? and ??? ????????" - colour me intrigued. There are also now 18+ lobbies to try to ensure chat is safer for young players. (Although all this means is that players have to accept a pop-up when joining 18+ servers. Not exactly perfect but better than nothing.)</p><p>"The launch product was rushed and a bit of a mess," said creator "lamedeveloper" in the update post, pointing out that the entire development time of the game totalled just 5 months. "I ended up not really being proud of the product I had put out. Hopefully, this patch addresses most of the major issues with the game (and I can finally sleep a bit)."</p>

<p>Nvidia is making some major changes to its GeForce Now game streaming service, including putting a limit on how much people can play games on the service.</p>



<p>In a new post on the service’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Reddit page</a>, Nvidia revealed that next year will see limits of 100 hours per month to play games using GeForce Now subscription service. </p>



<p>The company says its to “continue providing exceptional quality and speed” as well as “shorter queue times”. This limit will be placed on Performance and Ultimate subscribers. The Performance plan gives players 1440p streaming, ray tracing, and six-hour play seassions for $9.99 per month. Ultimate ups the resolution to 4K 120 or 1080p 240 with ray tracing, HDR, DLSS 3, and eight-hour sessions for $19.99 per month.</p>



<p>Free subscribers, which only offers one-hour sessions and has ads, won’t have a monthly limit.</p>



<p>“This ample limit comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe,” Nvidia said.</p>



<p>The company added that up to 15 hours of unused playtime will be rolled over to the next month. Think of it like the minutes rollover from old school cell phone plans.</p>



<p>At its max, players can have up to 115 hours of playtime available in a given month. Should you go over your threshold however, it’ll cost you. Nvidia says it will cost players $2.99 for 15 more hours per month on the Performance plan. Those on the Ultimate will get 15 hours at $5.99 for the month.</p>



<p>With the 100 limit starting in 2025, not everyone will be held to it right away. Nvidia says that those who are active paid members by December 31, 2024 won’t be affected by the changes until January 2026. That gives them an extra year of unlimited playtime.</p>



<p>Lastly, those with a Founders membership to will have unlimited playtime “for life”. Upgrading or changing their membership, however, will apply the new limits.</p>



<p>What do you think of the play time limits for Nvidia GeForce Now? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It’s always nice to see someone giving Escape From Tarkov a run for its money in the extraction shooter space, and the free-to-play Arena Breakout: Infinite appears to be holding its own. There were some controversies initially, like with its monetization system, but the first-person shooter garnered a following and has held firm. Now, they’re about to launch Arena Breakout: Infinite Season 1, complete with a new map, new weapons, unique gameplay elements, and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-arena-breakout-infinite-season-1-begin">When Does Arena Breakout Infinite Season 1 Begin?</h2>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the launch of season one</a> before returning to Arena Breakout: Infinite, or if you haven’t stopped playing the extraction shooter but desire more content, you should know you don’t have to wait long. It’s out on November 20, and it’s said to be the most significant update to the game since its launch.</p>

<p>While MoreFun—the studio behind Arena Breakout: Infinite—hasn’t unveiled everything coming in Season 1, they did show off some of the big hits we can expect, like:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Free Items</strong>

            <p>Nintendo's Legend of Zelda film adaptation will be released at some point in the next five years and two months.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't shared a specific year for Link and Zelda's hop to the big screen as yet, however the company has at least narrowed it down to 2020-something.</p>

<p>In this week's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo shared an update on its 'visual content', which means its movie projects.</p>
<p>"In the field of visual content, we are making direct investments and are deeply involved in the planning and development of multiple productions," it wrote, with an accompanying infographic showing that rather vague Zelda release window: 202X.</p>
<p>Here, it also noted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">upcoming Super Mario Bros. sequel will make its debut in April 2026</a>. Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Super Mario Bros. animated movie was a huge success for the company</a>, with Nintendo stating it was viewed in theaters by approximately 170 million people.</p>

<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie this time last year</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the movie</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>Film producer Avi Arad is also on board. Arad's previous video game to film projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">this year's Borderlands adaptation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms">Tom Holland-fronted Uncharted</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the company gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-not-ruling-out-future-acquisitions-but-still-favours-organic-expansion-to-maintain-creative-culture">further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions</a>, while also confirming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch successor will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered patch is now live for the PC version of the game, fixing select issues and bringing performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>Patch 1.1 focuses on introducing fixes that improve the experience, such as fixes for audio issues for pre-rendered cutscenes, which should now have the same volume as gameplay, a bug that causes disappearing or flickering shadows in Meridian when playing on ultrawide resolutions, HUD markers for objectives not rendering correctly with a custom FOV, Steam Input improvements and more. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2561580/view/4480612432780198115?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official patch notes</a> also mention various user interface, performance, and stability improvements, which, sadly, haven't been detailed in full, as well as the team working on future patches that will further improve the remaster.</p>
<p>Long considered a controversial remaster, given that the original is far from an old game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is a worthwhile upgrade of the PlayStation 4 release, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">greatly enhanced visuals and perfect performance</a> on both PlayStation 5 and PC. While the game doesn't look close in any way to its sequel, Forbidden West, the remaster's visual upgrades go a long way to competently close the gap between the two games.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26.1029804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developed by Dreamate and published by Fulqrum Publishing, New Arc Line is officially announced to be entering the Early Access period as of November 26, 2024. The game originally received a demo during <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-5-games-you-should-try-during-this-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a>, a period where a ton of demos are available, as well as games going on sale to showcase new and upcoming games. After receiving a lot of feedback during the demo period of New Arc Line, they have made the decision to opt into the Early Access period.</p>
<p>They've mentioned that they have opted to do this so that they can work closely with the fans to be able to make the full release of New Arc Line a smoother and more enjoyable experience for everyone involved. To celebrate the release of New Arc Line being in Early Access, a trailer has been released on YouTube to showcase some of the content that you can expect from the upcoming title. It's only 37 seconds long but shows off some of the main features of the game, including dice rolls, combat, and the expansive SteamPunk world that you'll get to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Arc Line | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anrIQ4K6QXQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As addressed in the announcement, the developers and publisher are aware that there will be players who are on edge about New Arc Line going into Early Access, especially as it's a story-driven game. However, in the announcement, it's been confirmed that the initial Early Access launch will "only contain about a quarter of the main storyline." Of course, as they continue development during the Early Access period, there are plans to add in more areas and quests to do, released across multiple content updates leading up to the full release. However, they plan to do it in a way that contributes more to the game's side quests and world-building content rather than giving away the main story too early on.</p>
<p>In addition, they will be using the Early Access period to focus on adding more classes, abilities, and companions that you can explore the world with, as well as making current mechanics in the game as balanced as possible so that when the full game is released, it releases with minimal issues.</p>
<p>If you're interested in picking up New Arc Line while it's in the Early Access period, the game is currently at a significantly reduced price of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$19.99 on Steam</a>, which has been confirmed that they will be increasing later on when the game is more developed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has received a surprise Xbox release today, and the gaming legend has also announced that he and his studio Kojima Productions have acquired the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>is now available on Xbox Series X|S (although not on Xbox One), as well as the Microsoft Store and, uh, Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Kojima Productions says that this release is part of its strategy to "focus on bringing [its] award-winning IP&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>to more platforms and audiences", and as part of that mission, the studio also "now has full ownership" of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>as an IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=jlin_5jD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=bIpoE2iv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>is now available on Xbox Series X|S, in all its weird glory.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the version of <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>that's&nbsp;available on Xbox Series X|S now is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-is-coming-soon-to-playstation-5">the Director's Cut</a>, which means it includes a new location, new delivery items to help you out with your treks, and extra combat moves, plus lots more.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the base&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>game, of course, which remains the same profoundly odd and yet strangely compelling "walking simulator" it was when it first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-release-date-announced-along-with-new-trailer">launched on PS4 back in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, Kojima Productions is hard at work on a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022">once again star Norman Reedus</a> as protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, along with other returning stars like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on">Léa Seydoux</a> and Troy Baker.</p>

<p>Said sequel is currently set to launch next year for PS5, although now that Kojima has gained control of the <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>IP, it may very well come to other platforms in due course as well.</p>




<p>Filming for <i>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed">completed back in May</a>, so it looks like progress on the game continues apace. Let's hope it doesn't get delayed.</p>

<p>While you wait for that, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA11260_00-DEATHSTRAND00001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and now <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding/9nkchzztl308" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> as well.

Starting today, a select number of users will have the ability to play around in their <em>NMS</em> universe across a collection of platforms with the new cross-save functionality. According to the announcement, adding cross-saving was a bit of an undertaking for the development team.</p><p>“It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves,” <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">the announcement reads</a>. “Adding&nbsp;cross-save&nbsp;for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them.”</p><p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> now supports cross-saves across PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Series S/X, Xbox Game Pass, PC, Steam Deck, PSVR 1 / 2, PCVR, GOG, and Nintendo Switch. Players can <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save">visit this site</a> to link their different platform accounts and read the cross-save FAQ. However, only a select few players will be able to play their saves across different platforms with Hello Games rolling out the functionality to more players in the coming days.</p><p>November 7th is known in the BioWare fandom as N7 Day (get it, <strong>N</strong>ovember <strong>7</strong>th) — a semi-official community holiday celebrating all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. In 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22446499/no-mans-sky-mass-effect-normandy-starship">Hello Games introduced <em>Mass Effect</em>’s famous starship</a>, the SSV Normandy SR-1 as a collectible ship. For this year’s N7 Day, the Normandy is back for players to claim for a limited time.</p><p>In addition to cross-saves and cool ships, to coincide with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the launch of the PS5 Pro</a>, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is also getting an enhanced version compatible with the souped up console. Updated features include 4K resolution at 60fps, support for 8K resolution at 30fps, and improved lighting. </p><p>All three updates are available now and are completely free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile’s minimum requirements will be increased to iOS 17/Android 13 or higher from November 14, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1854249671994012087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, Warzone Mobile’s minimum specifications require devices with iOS 17/Android 13 or higher on a device with a GPU capable of bindless texturing. If players wish to receive updates and access to the latest game version for Season 1 and beyond, they must meet those requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All is not lost for Warzone Mobile players who don’t meet the minimum requirements. The developers have provided 6 months for players to transition to a new device. Players with older iOS and Android versions can play “version 3.10 for a limited time (approximately six months),” provided they were already on ver 3.10 before November 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warzone Mobile developers have stated that the minimum requirements had to be updated for future updates and integrations with the Call of Duty franchise. They are currently working to bring new shared features such as Omnimovement and connected content coming with BO6/WZ S1. </p>



<p>IPhone X and below do not support iOS 17; you will need an iPhone XS or higher to play the latest version of Warzone Mobile. For other queries, check out their <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-minimum-specifications-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ section</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty Mobile has reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-mobile-one-billion-downloads-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion downloads worldwide</a>.

<p>Shift Up has just confirmed that Stellar Blade can take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s processing power. For those running the game on Sony’s latest iteration of the PlayStation 5, two new graphics presets can be found in the settings: Pro and Pro Max. Both of these prests introduce HFR, but Pro Max causes a noticeable frame rate drop.</p>

<h2 id="h-photo-mode-when">Photo Mode When?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media platforms</a>, Shift Up posted a comparison video showcasing the difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro Stellar Blade gameplay. It takes something of a trained eye to truly spot the difference, but it’s there – somewhere.</p>

<p>Of course, in the comments under these posts, fans were quick to demand an ETA for photo mode, which was announced recently by Shift Up and is on the way. It doesn’t have a date for when it’s going to be added to the game, but it’s one of the most highly anticipated features that fans are holding out for.</p>



<p>It should have been present when the game was released, but who am I to judge?</p>



<p>The team also revealed recently that the game’s first major DLC is on the way. In September, the team at Shift Up announced a Stellar Blade x Nier Automata crossover that will ‘bring post-apocalyptic universes colliding together’. </p>



<p>In April, when Stellar Blade was released, it topped the charts and shifted a million copies in just a few weeks, which isn’t bad for a new IP. It’s encouraging to see that Shift Up has plans to deliver more content, and this PR5 Pro Max upgrade is only the beginning.</p>

This has been a huge undertaking, and is one of most requested features.</p><p>Being able to jump seamlessly between platforms is really transformative. Players can play from the comfort of their sofa on console, continue an Expedition on the move with Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their beefy <a title="Platforms > PC [21,645 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> rig, and view it in incredibly immersive <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> now supports cross-play and cross-save between a huge number of platforms including PC, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,415 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> and PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,616 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a> and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,285 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, Steam Deck, <a title="Platforms > PS VR [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr">PlayStation VR</a> and <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [215 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, and PC VR.</p><p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.</p><p>It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then!</p><p>For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over 6 months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all <em>No Man’s Sky</em> players can connect their different platform accounts together <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. A subset of players will then be admitted to the beta. Participants in the beta will be able to upload and download saves from any connected platform, via the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p><p><strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></p><p><iframe title="No Man's Sky PlayStation 5 Pro Footage (8k)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ff9hZavmEU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PlayStation 5 Pro releases today and is an incredible feat of engineering. We were so excited to get our hands on it from early days of development. We couldn’t wait to see what was possible in <em>No Man’s Sky</em> with so much power at our disposal!</p><p>We’re excited to be able to share an enhanced version of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> for PlayStation 5 Pro with players at launch. Bringing even more detail and higher image quality than ever possible on console before.</p><p><a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) allows for incredible upscaling to provide crisp 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> will also be an early supporter of 8K resolution, with the universe looking incredible in 8K at 30fps.</p><p>As well as a much sharper resolution at higher framerates, the increased power of the PlayStation 5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board. Players on PlayStation 5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. Explore the most beautiful and detailed alien worlds <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has to offer, for the first time on console.</p><p>Not only this, but all of these improvements also come to PlayStation VR2! With our most stunning virtual reality imagery offering an even more immersive experience for Travellers amongst the stars.</p><p>The small team at Hello Games like nothing more than to play around with new technology. From supporting our players on first generation hardware, right back to Switch and PlayStation 4, to the highest end PCs, next generation consoles, and now support for cutting edge PlayStation 5 Pro is available at launch as another free update.</p><p><strong>The Normandy Returns</strong></p><p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Mass Effect Normandy Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9tWSdd1hD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Everyone here at Hello Games is a huge sci-fi nerd. One of our absolute favorite series is the incredible <em>Mass Effect</em> games. To join in <em>Mass Effect</em>‘s annual N7 celebrations, we are pleased to welcome the legendary SSV Normandy SR1 back into <em>No Man’s Sky</em>!</p><p>It was back in 2021 that the Normandy made its first appearance in one of the first expeditions we ever ran. The limited-time expedition starts today, runs for two weeks and culminates in players being able to claim the Normandy for their fleet.</p><p>In the intervening years since that event, we have welcomed a huge number of Travellers, not least a whole new cohort of Switch players and an increasingly large number of Chinese fans. Many of these new players have envied those who proudly displayed their Normandy in their frigate collection.</p><p><em>Mass Effect</em> fans know that this legendary frigate only appears when it is most needed! Today, and for the next two weeks, as a love-letter from one science fiction game to another, we are giving everyone another chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p><p>Huge thanks to our friends at <a title="Companies > Electronic Arts [1,756 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a> and <a title="Companies > BioWare [369 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/bioware">BioWare</a> for helping make this happen.</p><p>It has been a momentous year for <em>No Man’s Sky</em> in a number of ways. We’re so grateful to be able to continue this journey with you.</p><p><strong>5.25 Patch Notes</strong></p><ul><li>Cross-Save is now enabled for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, allowing players to transfer save games between all platforms.
