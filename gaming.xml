            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insensitive-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has found itself in yet more trouble, this time over a collector's figurine depicting protagonists Yasuke and Naoe alongside a one-legged Torii gate.</p>
<p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by IGN</a>, collectible company PureArts <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1846193318742434183" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said yesterday</a>&nbsp;that it is "reworking the design" of its Qlectors Yasuke &amp; Naoe figurine, which it says had an "insensitive design" that caused "concerns" from which it has subsequently learned.</p>
<p>The figurine in question was <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1836873014085914794" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally revealed back in September</a>&nbsp;and depicted the two protagonists of <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</i>next to (or atop, in Naoe's case) a Torii gate with one pillar instead of the standard two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/purearts-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-offensive.jpg?itok=Zb30fbjO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/purearts-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-offensive.jpg?itok=Zb0JXuXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some took exception to this PureArts figurine of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>protagonists Yasuke and Naoe.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with Torii gates, they can be found near Japanese religious shrines, and they traditionally represent the boundary between the human and divine realms.</p>
<p>The one-legged Torii gate, however, has specific significance; as IGN points out, perhaps the most famous one-legged Torii gate in the world <a href="https://www.discover-nagasaki.com/en/sightseeing/117" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can be found at Nagasaki's Sanno shrine</a>, and it stands as a memorial to the devastation caused by the atomic bomb being dropped on the city in 1945.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that Ubisoft or PureArts intended to cause any offense by depicting a one-legged Torii gate in the figurine, but this is just the latest blunder in a series of misfortunes that have surrounded&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date">its announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the game was revealed, some began to take exception to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy">depiction of protagonist Yasuke</a> (a real-life historical figure) as a samurai, a point about which those taking offense say there is some contention.</p>

<p>This isn't even the first time an ancillary piece of media or art relating to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has caused controversy.</p>
<p>Back in July, Ubisoft found itself in trouble when a piece of art in the game's Collector's Edition artbook was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology">found to use the flag of a Sekigahara re-enactment group</a> without its permission.</p>
<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>was also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">delayed to February next year</a>&nbsp;as part of what appears to be a company-wide strategy rethink at Ubisoft, triggered by the underperformance of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>.</p>
<p>This is all against the backdrop of some of Ubisoft's investors&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">urgently suggesting a change in management</a>, with bosses the Guillemots and Tencent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report">reportedly considering taking the company private</a> in response.</p>

            <p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> publisher Ubisoft put out a 3-days-weekly return to office mandate for their entire staff worldwide - a decision that French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/">said was</a> "made without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers’ representatives". In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/15/ubisoft-staff-in-france-strike-over-home-working_6729463_4.html">Le Monde</a>.</p>
<p>"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."</p>

<p>"After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions," the union wrote. "Our employer knows this perfectly well. The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues’ jobs, the disorganisation of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain."</p><p>The tactic that the STJV refer to here, sometimes called ‘soft layoffs’, is the argument that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html">RTO mandates </a>are a deliberate ploy on the part of an employer to restructure a workforce without firing workers outright - an approach that disproportionately affects clinically vulnerable people and others who can't work in the office without reasonable adjustments. Back in July, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> developer Cloud Imperium were fined for discrimination after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">dismissing an autistic senior programmer</a>, following his requests to work from home being denied.</p>
<p>"Unions said they had received no response to the grievances aired in February," write Le Monde. "The September message was ‘the straw that broke the camel's back'". Clement Montigny of the STJV union told Agence France-Presse (AFP) the move to in-person working broke promises made to staff and "calls into question the way they organise their lives."</p>
<p>The STJV’s demands include a formal agreement on remote work ("not an arbitrary decision taken several months in advance"), an increase in all salaries "to compensate for the drop in our living standards,” and “actually listening to employees opinion. Management seems indeed to confuse monologue with dialogue."</p>
<p>Speaking to AFB and Le Monde at the strikes, a designer at Ubisoft described the atmosphere as "gloomy", and said staff were disillusioned and feeling as though they weren’t being listened to.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a Bloomberg report suggested that Ubisoft owners Tencent and the Guillemot family <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">were considering a buyout</a>. Regarding affairs mildly stabtastic, Ubisoft announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">coming to Steam day one</a>, following delays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only is it disappointing to miss out on a cool cinematic, but wasting your Ki and leaving yourself open to attacks just plain sucks. This guide is going to explain why this occurs and how you can prevent it from happening so much.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e2381293996c4f2c43c84b2e146a4ce8" data-recommend-id="image://e2381293996c4f2c43c84b2e146a4ce8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tiny Android 18 in the distance, with Goku coming in on the right side with a flying kick." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A tiny Android 18 in the distance, with Goku coming in on the right side with a flying kick." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e2381293996c4f2c43c84b2e146a4ce8" data-recommend-id="image://e2381293996c4f2c43c84b2e146a4ce8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tiny Android 18 in the distance, with Goku coming in on the right side with a flying kick." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There are a couple of reasons why your rush supers might not be landing, and <strong>the most common explanation is that the tracking isn’t accurate one hundred percent of the time</strong>. I’ve used some supers that land very consistently, and others that can feel like a gamble during a match. Flying at high speeds with a wonky camera certainly doesn’t help either.<br></p><p>An additional reason that compounds the issue is your opponent responding with an appropriate move. It’s easy for these attacks to connect in training mode against a lifeless CPU, but a real opponent who knows how to quickly recover might be able to dodge or even block it in time. That’s why we’re going to go over the best scenarios for these kinds of supers, so you don’t have to keep seeing your favorite version of Goku fly toward the camera at Mach 10.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-recommend-id="image://eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza doubles over after taking a Heavy Finish from Gogeta." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Frieza doubles over after taking a Heavy Finish from Gogeta." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-recommend-id="image://eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza doubles over after taking a Heavy Finish from Gogeta." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>The best way to land these attacks is to deliver one after a heavy finish.</strong> You’ll know it’s performed correctly if your opponent bends forward while holding their stomachs. While these commonly have combo extensions for more damage, they’re also a great moment to show off with a flashy super.<br></p><p>A majority of characters have one or two Rush Chain combos that can result in a heavy finish, but some don’t have any at all. The inputs aren’t universal across characters either, so I recommend taking your fighters into training and then checking the Rush Chain Actions page. It isn’t explicitly stated, but this page is unique to every character.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-recommend-id="image://beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gogeta watches as Frieza launches into the air after a launcher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gogeta watches as Frieza launches into the air after a launcher." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-recommend-id="image://beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gogeta watches as Frieza launches into the air after a launcher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Another common method is to input the super after using a launcher or Vanishing Attack. Many Rush Supers start fast, meaning you can follow and catch up to the opponent as they’re still being knocked back. The big caveat here is that it can be ruined if they recover fast enough. Be wise about which launchers, as well as which supers, you use.<br></p><p>Taking the above into consideration, another idea is to launch them towards the ground and use a super as they make contact. These attacks can hit a grounded opponent, albeit at reduced damage.

<p>There’s seemingly never a shortage of lengthy role-playing games that demand tens or hundreds of hours of your free time to complete, and BioWare is perhaps the reigning king of offering such massive titles. You can spend significant time exploring, completing side quests, and unearthing companion stories in its games. We’re all about to lose ourselves to the studio’s newest title. Here’s everything we know about Dragon Age: The Veilguard!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard">What is Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is an epic RPG from developer BioWare, the renowned studio behind Dragon Age: Origins and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The Veilguard sees players return to Thedas, a land full of magnificent vistas and dangerous dungeons, as a corrupt god aims to take over and dominate its people.</p>



<p>You play as Rook, an all-new hero in the franchise, with choices that alter how you play and how the story unfolds, along with a party of seven unique companions. Your task, as Rook, is to unite The Veilguard, restoring the ancient order to fight demons and, worse, the aforementioned corrupt gods.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date">Do We Know the Dragon Age: The Veilguard Release Date?</h2>



<p>It’s been a long time coming, especially since many of us have eagerly anticipated another RPG from developer BioWare for years now, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard officially releases on <strong>October 31, 2024</strong>. There is no advanced access period, so if you pre-order the game or buy it on<strong> </strong>day one, you’ll receive access like everyone else.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-system-requirements">What Are the Dragon Age: The Veilguard System Requirements?</h2>

<p>Besides the massive storage requirements, the overall PC system requirements for Dragon Age: The Veilguard don’t appear overwhelmingly tricky to run. Do you think your gaming rig can handle the upcoming RPG from BioWare?</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>

<h2 id="h-does-dragon-age-the-veilguard-have-character-creation">Does Dragon Age: The Veilguard Have Character Creation?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Yes! Dragon Age: The Veilguard features a full-fledged character creation suite, allowing players to alter their race, faction, class, and appearance heavily at the start of the game. There’s some controversy surrounding the Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creation mechanics, with a loud minority calling it “woke” for including certain customization options. But hey, you don’t need to use those options!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-factions">What Are the Dragon Age: The Veilguard Factions?</h2>



<p>The RPG features six factions, which you’ll work with throughout the game to influence the story. They include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Antivan Crows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grey Wardens</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lords of Fortune</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mourn Watch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shadow Dragons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veil Jumpers</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard-a-direct-sequel-to-dragon-age-inquisition">Is Dragon Age: The Veilguard a Direct Sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition?</h2>



<p>Yes! Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a direct sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition. The RPG heavily focuses on Solas, a party member from the latter, who becomes the primary antagonist in The Veilguard. You’ll fight across Thedas to stop Solas from gaining any more power and altering the course of history.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-returning-characters-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Are There Any Returning Characters in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>Alongside Solas, we’ll also see the return of Varric Tethras, Lace Harding, Leliana, and Morrigan, and rumors are pointing toward Dorian returning for, at the very least, a quick cameo.</p>



<p>Despite the number of returning characters, you don’t need to play any previous games to enjoy The Veilguard, though it may help you acclimate to the lore and story!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-main-character-voiced-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Is The Main Character Voiced in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>The main protagonist in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is fully voiced and will speak in cutscenes throughout the game. You can choose one of four voices during character creation: two male and two female.</p>



<p>While I, like many of you, would prefer a silent protagonist for greater immersion, allowing us to choose a voice is a small concession.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-hands-on-preview-all-out-magical-war/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The original&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fairy-tail-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairy Tail,</a> released back in 2020, ended up being one of the best JRPGs based on a manga and anime series ever made. Japanese studio Gust, known for being the developer of the Atelier series, managed to masterfully capture the spirit of the franchise, creating a game that can be enjoyed by both fans of Hiro Mashima's work and complete newcomers, despite some small shortcomings that do not detract from the experience in any major way. Four years later, Gust will bring players back to Earth-land with Fairy Tail 2, which is setting out to outdo its predecessor in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>Following my short hands-on session during this year's Gamescom, where I also had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-producer-hiroshi-kataoka-discussing-the-series-new-combat-system-additional-content/">speak with producer Hiroshi Kitaoka</a>, I was recently able to try out the first five or so hours of Fairy Tail 2. This allowed me to get a better idea of the game's overall progression flow and, most importantly, the new battle system, which I feel will be one of the highlights of the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241007174217_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As previously confirmed, Fairy Tail 2 will adapt the Alvarez Empire Arc, where Natsu and the entire Fairy Tail guild take on emperor Spriggan Zeref Dragneel and the powerful members of the Spriggan 12. Right from the Prologue, the game wastes no time throwing players into the thick of the action, providing a first tutorial battle that teaches players the basics while introducing some of the major players of the new story arc. Those with no knowledge of the manga may find themselves a little confused, but the game does a very good job providing all the background information needed to understand the story, the world, and the characters themselves, with the Check Terminology feature, which allows the player to quickly learn more about terms highlighted during dialogue sequences.</p>
<p>Still, unsurprisingly, those with knowledge of the story arc Fairy Tail 2 is adapting will have a much better time right from the get-go, as there's a lot the game throws at the player during the first couple of hours. The characters that appear in the first few chapters are already well-established as well, so a little research in the in-game Database is expected. This feature provides information on characters and story events that happened before the Alvarez Empire arc, which definitely helps, although reading the manga or watching the anime remains a way better option to learn more about the world and characters created by Hiro Mashima.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241007175221_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though the first few hours of Fairy Tail 2 proceed mostly on rails, they give the chance to explore a few locations and fight quite a few battles. Exploration is mostly in line with what other modern JRPGs offer, featuring some medium-sized fields filled with items and enemies, which can be attacked beforehand to start a battle with an advantage, and little else, although things could be different in later chapters.</p>
<p>Combat, on the other hand, really stands out from traditional JRPGs. Doing away with the straightforward turn-based system used in the first entry in the series, Fairy Tail 2 uses a system that mixes together real-time and turn-based features. During the battle, players can only control a single character, and the two other party members will fight on their own, unleashing skills as needed. A circular bar indicates when the controlled character can act, and once they can, it is possible to use regular attacks to gain SP that can be used to unleash skills with different properties and area of effects. Skills can combo together or even be used repeatedly to increase power for increased SP. Once all SP has been depleted, the turn will end.</p>
<p>Adding more complexity to this combat system are the Break mechanics. Every enemy in Fairy Tail 2 has a Break gauge that is depleted with every attack. By depleting one bar, it is possible to command any of the characters controlled by the AI to unleash a skill that can also buff the party. Depleting the Break gauge completely permits the party members to unleash Duo Raids, combination skills that deal a lot of damage and have more diverse properties than regular skills, such as healing and debuffing. All this, in conjunction with the ability to guard at any time to reduce incoming damage, switch characters on the fly, and different elemental properties, promise to make combat in Fairy Tail 2 extremely dynamic and fun. The system also has some decent depth to it, as there are ways to extend attacks per single turn, so I'm really looking forward to delving deeper into it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241010142221_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Fairy Tail 2 may be, on the surface, a game for fans of the manga and anime series, but the excellent work Gust seems to have done to make the experience welcoming to newcomers and its combat system will offer a lot even to those who have little knowledge of the original material. To learn if the game will have what it takes to stay toe-to-toe with more established franchises, we won't have to wait much longer, as Fairy Tail 2 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch on<a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-december/"> December 11th, 2024.</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/astro-bot-new-speedrun-level-and-special-bots-out-tomorrow/?sf275076782=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PlayStation Blog post</a>, Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet says that the first speedrun level, Building Speed, will arrive tomorrow, October 17th. It'll come alongside an online leaderboard to allow you to compare your skills with the rest of the&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>community.</p>
<p>Building Speed will equip you with bulldog dash boost powerup Barkster, alongside whom you'll need to "blast your way through a sky-high city", dodging obstacles like cranes and "a flying car wash" on your way to the goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-speedrun-stage-new-bots-building-speed.jpg?itok=ihYjDKBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-speedrun-stage-new-bots-building-speed.jpg?itok=7mKypcas 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting a brand new speedrun stage tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>From this point on, you'll be getting a new speedrun level in&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>every week, so you'll have something to keep you busy if you're looking for an excuse to keep playing Team Asobi's delightful platformer.</p>
<p>Next week's level is called Let it Slide, followed by Spring-loaded Run on Halloween, Helium Heights on November 7th, and Rising Heat on November 14th. It's not clear if the weekly speedrun levels will continue after that.</p>
<p>Naturally, this update also brings ten new bots for you to rescue, some of whom we already know about; last month's State of Play gave us a look at the Helldivers from Arrowhead's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2"><i>Helldivers 2</i></a>, as well as Eve from Shift Up's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million">hugely popular</a> hack-and-slash action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>.</p>
<p>There will, however, also be other bots to rescue, and Team Asobi is being relatively cagey regarding who those bots will be, so you'll have to play the new level to find out. Exciting times!</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, it's a 3D platformer created by Team Asobi that celebrates PlayStation's legacy.</p>
<p>Protagonist and lil' robo-mascot Astro platforms his way across a series of classic-style 3D platformer stages, rescuing a host of bots based on famous PlayStation properties like&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>along the way.</p>

<p>For a couple of months, a full buyout of Guild Esports was being touted, with many believing it would serve as a last-ditch effort to rescue the brand that has undergone financial issues in recent years. Now, that acquisition has been completed, with US-based firm, DCB Sports LLC, securing Guild Esports in full for a one-off cash payment of just $130,000.</p>



<p>DCB now owns 100% of Guild’s assets – but that also includes outstanding liabilities and debts.</p>



<p>What does this mean for Guild Esports?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-times-are-changing">Times Are Changing</h2>



<p>Per a report, DCB Sports will assume ownership of Guild and set up a new brand identity dubbed ‘Guild Esports and Gaming Ltd’. The $130,000 that DCB paid to secure the brand will be soaked up by the remnants of Guild Esports PLC. It was subsequently revealed that the original company will be renamed to ‘Cassel Capital PLC’ to avoid confusion post-transaction.</p>



<p>As news of the acquisition broke, Guild’s CEO, Jasmine Skee, announced her decision to resign from the company, vacating the position she’d held for almost two years.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.investegate.co.uk/announcement/rns/guild-esports--gild/completion-of-the-asset-acquisition-by-dcb-sports/8488426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a full release</a> published by Guild Esports PLC, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Guild’s Chief Executive, Jasmine Skee, has taken the decision to resign from the Company and step down from the Board of Directors with immediate effect to pursue new opportunities. The Board sincerely thanks Ms Skee for her significant contributions and strategic leadership of the Company under difficult conditions, and in particular, her efforts in completing the Transaction. Following Ms Skee’s resignation, the board will comprise Derek Lew and Brian Stockbridge, the Company’s non-executive directors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To date, Guild Esports has invested time and effort into various competitive ecosystems, such as Apex Legends, FIFA, PUBG, Fortnite, VALORANT, FGC games, Rocket League, EA Sports FC, and more.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Official 35 Minute Developer Deep Dive</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I recently played a little more than three hours of Stalker 2 that covered the beginning of the game and its opening few missions. My experience in the Zone could sometimes get frustrating, especially after trying to take down the same group of bandits four or five times, only to get overwhelmed and shot to death or blown up by one guy's extremely well-placed grenade. But once I started to get the hang of keeping myself alive by moving cautiously, exploring, and identifying threats at a distance, I found that Stalker 2 felt harrowing and invigorating in equal measure. It requires players to be on their guard and rewards them with strange, exciting experiences in the Zone.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 starts by immediately introducing you to the weirdnesses of the Zone. After both the historical Chornobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 and a fictional one in 2006, the Exclusion Zone is filled with strange, almost supernatural goings-on. Whirlwinds will toss people into the air and then implode their bodies; there are spherical gravitational anomalies that look like near-invisible bubbles that suck you into them; sometimes, jets of flame or bursts of electricity erupt from the ground if you wander too close.</p><p dir="ltr">Anomalies range from dangerous to deadly, but they can also be incredibly valuable. If you can make your way into the center of some anomalies, carefully picking a path based on the loud beeping of a detector that tells you just how close to danger you are, you can find an artifact--a strange object with unexplainable properties that you can equip on your character. That's what Stalkers--scavengers who make their livelihood in the Zone--are after.</p><p dir="ltr">After a betrayal during your trip into the Zone, you wind up becoming a Stalker too, mostly out of necessity as you try to find the person who turned on you and get back a special artifact they stole. Much like in the original Stalker, you're hunting a single person down and interacting with other people who live their life in the Zone. That means heading to Stalker settlements and taking on jobs to trade for information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385008" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385008"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 throws you in the deep end almost immediately. After the tutorial--where you're left for dead--another Stalker rescues you and introduces you to the mechanic of chucking metal bolts at anomalies to trigger them, which sometimes gives you the opportunity to run through them while they reset, and otherwise can let you probe their edges to see their size and distance. He points you in the direction of a town where Stalkers hang out, and along the way, you can pick up side missions and mix it up with random adversaries.</p><p dir="ltr">One of those side missions involved finding a Stalker trapped in a destroyed post office, engaged in a gun battle with some of the lawless bandits who also inhabit the Zone. Kill them, and he'll offer you the job of heading up the street to the bandits' stronghold to help his pal, this one being held because of gambling debts incurred by the guy in the post office. Here's where I died several times, because fighting human enemies can be extremely tough.</p><p>Combat feels a lot like in the original Stalker, where you're relying on weapons that aren't especially well-maintained or accurate. You can sneak up on the enemies in blasted-out buildings up the road from the post office, a few of whom are patrolling around and having conversations, to get the drop on them, but actually shooting them can be tough. A headshot is generally lethal against any human enemy, but body shots are way less predictable, and getting accurate aim under pressure was tough in any case. Part of it is definitely due to elements of Stalker 2 that are meant to make the game difficult and to make every fight feel intense and dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a jankiness to fighting overall, though, that can get a little irritating. It's not uncommon to be peeking out of cover, blasting away at your foes, only to have another guy walk right up behind you and shoot you in the back of the head, with no way of knowing he was there. And as mentioned, it can be tough to land accurate shots; at times I felt like I was dumping a whole magazine of bullets into one guy to little effect, while others went down immediately after one well-placed shot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385010"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Reloading the same small firefight four or five times was a little bit galling, and it may be that in situations like this, you'll find yourself playing a fight over and over, getting to know exactly where each enemy is, and then using your knowledge to finally overcome the situation. On the other hand, though, getting walloped a few times in what was essentially my first battle impressed a key piece of information on me about Stalker 2: Fighting is extremely dangerous, and you should avoid it wherever possible.</p><p>The unreliability of combat feels intentional--the developers want you to be careful about taking on people you find out in the world, and staying on guard to avoid bumbling into firefights. It also had me thinking twice about future side quests. Did I really want to walk into some meat grinder of a bandit camp just for a few coupons? Was the Stalker who gave me the job setting me up? Those elements put a different spin on Stalker 2's open world that works well for making the place feel dangerous at all times.</p><p dir="ltr">Even cooler were my chances just to explore the Zone and encounter strange things. Walking to any given place means watching for and avoiding anomalies and mutants, as well as humans. I found two Stalkers running from twisted pigs called Fleshes at a farm, and watched as one barricaded himself inside the farmhouse while the other was killed by the creatures. Killing them all showed that combat can be as clunky against mutants as it is against humans. As I circle-strafed the pigs, they leapt at me over and over again, while I dumped a bunch of bullets into each one. Moments like this, again, gave Stalker 2 a more awkward feel than most modern games tend to have. There's a degree to which Stalker 2 seems like it's right out of 2008, which gives it both a unique feel in keeping with its setting and ideas, and sometimes makes it cumbersome to actually play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385011" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385011"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I saved the survivor, who thanked me before letting me go on my way. Later, I noticed another group of those same mutated pigs out in a field, with an anomaly floating nearby. This time, I drew their attention with a few gunshots and then stood with the anomaly between me and them, letting them charge right into it and implode in midair. It was as satisfying a solution as it was efficient, and played into the idea that paying attention and using your knowledge of the Zone might be more interesting for gameplay experiences than relying on more run-of-the-mill video game elements like shooting. The combat feeling a little clunky and creaky, just like your fragility as a character, encourages that approach.</p><p dir="ltr">One side mission took me to a particularly cool location: a field of deadly anomalous poppy flowers. Like in The Wizard of Oz, the poppies make anyone who strays into the field uncontrollably sleepy, but if you fall asleep here, you never wake up. What's more, you hear strange whispers and echoes of the dead who've been lost in the field. Running around, searching for a lost religious icon belonging to someone who used to live in the area before the accident, I had to keep chugging energy drinks to stay awake. The screen would darken as I started to drift off, signifying heavy eyelids. At the same time, a wisp of petals--some kind of anomaly, seemingly alive--would whip through the field, bringing with it a stronger, deadlier dose of drowsiness. I finally found the icon and got the hell out of there after the screen went dark for so long I was sure I'd succumbed to an endless slumber among the flowers.</p><p dir="ltr">The time spent in the settlement and advancing Stalker 2's main story presented a different kind of tension. In the first town I ventured into, I found locals in conflict with the Wardens, a military group working within the Zone, who were hunting a Stalker they believed had murdered some of their men. To get information about your betrayer, you can choose to work either with some of the locals, who want to protect the accused, or with the Wardens, taking on jobs for either one. If you talk to the Wardens, they'll send you to a location where they think the murderer is hiding out, given to them by a local informant. It was pretty obvious to me the informant had lied, hoping the Wardens would bumble into a trap, especially as he gave me a stern warning to be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">I chose to work with the other group and discovered the man was actually hiding in a windmill full of boobytraps--located in the complete opposite direction--where I helped him escape by venturing into a cave, killing an invisible mutant, and navigating a deadly anomaly in order to get him an artifact he needed. Though the preview ended before I learned about the fallout of my actions, it was clear the occupying Wardens weren't going anywhere, and wouldn't be happy if they never found their suspect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385012"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Navigating anomalies, navigating the open world and its mysteries, and navigating the politics of different competing factions all have me excited for Stalker 2. Its atmosphere of deadly, mysterious strangeness makes wandering its open world both alluring and frightening. Stalker 2 perfectly balances the desire to discover what's hidden out there, like a field full of whispering poppies, with the unnerving knowledge that the Zone is also full of things that can and likely will kill you. Though it can sometimes feel like a throwback to older games, especially in elements like its combat, it's that feeling that also helps make Stalker 2 both frightening and compelling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-league-of-legends-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced a wave of layoffs that will impact the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>development team, although co-founder Marc Merrill says the team will "eventually be even larger than it is today".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Merrill says the "tough decision" to lay off "some roles" among the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>team was made in order to make "sure we have the right expertise so that&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond".</p>
<p>Merrill doesn't specify how many team members are being laid off, nor does he say which departments will be most affected by the layoffs, but he does say that those being laid off will be supported by "a minimum of six months' pay, annual bonus, job placement assistance, health coverage, and more".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-game.jpg?itok=IumIleKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-game.jpg?itok=CV5nIfOt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>team is being hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Merrill goes on to say that "team effectiveness is more important than team size", but eventually, the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>team will grow in size "as we develop the next phase of&nbsp;<em>League</em>".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243939843821748" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup message</a>, he says that team size and budget "aren't the right way to measure whether a team will be successful", and that "having the right team, right priorities, and a sustainable approach" is more important than simply having a large team.</p>
<p>I'm sure that won't come as much consolation to the folks who are being laid off today, and the comments about the team eventually being bigger are a little strange in light of said layoffs, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-teamfight.jpg?itok=OxnXrJxS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-teamfight.jpg?itok=-T4ukt39 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The future of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>is still bright, Marc Merrill reckons.</figcaption></figure><p>These aren't the first Riot Games layoffs this year. Back in January, Riot announced it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease">laying off over 500 employees</a> and shutting down its Riot Forge division, which was responsible for publishing the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ruined-king-league-of-legends-story">Ruined King</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>
<p>Despite these layoffs, there's still plenty in the works for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and Riot Games as a whole. A new&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>fighting game spinoff,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is"><em>2XKO</em></a>, is currently in the works, and&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>itself is still getting new champions, including&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">Ambessa</a>, who's on the way sometime soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-8-million.1010847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced another major sales milestone for its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake, and the studio has also posted a new piece of artwork to celebrate the milestone.</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1846479698232324198" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Capcom confirms that the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has sold eight million copies since being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-confirmed">released last year</a>. That seems to suggest that sales are coming along nicely; sales were at <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240313.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seven million back in March</a>, so that's another million copies in the intervening months.</p>
<p>To celebrate the game's newest sales achievement, Capcom also posted art depicting Leon S. Kennedy, Ashley Graham, and Hunnigan all enjoying a day out together, which is a pretty heartwarming way to mark the occasion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-artwork.jpg?itok=b8oMu-7d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-artwork.jpg?itok=Aigp8Efn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has sold pretty well so far.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake was released towards the end of March last year, and it took the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days">just two days</a> to rack up three million sales.</p>
<p>Further <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-4-million-mercenaries-mode-now-available">milestones</a> would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-reach-5-million-capcom-announces">swiftly follow</a> in the weeks to come, cementing the remake's place as one of Capcom's best-selling&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million">hasn't quite caught up to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>yet</a>).</p>
<p>The remake is effectively a ground-up reimagining of the 2005 original, although it tells the same story, in which Leon Kennedy must travel to an unnamed Spanish village in order to rescue President Graham's daughter Ashley from a cult of parasite-worshipping fanatics.</p>
<p>Several major changes have been made in the remake, though, including alterations to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s core gameplay, narrative elements, and exploration, as well as the removal of some of the original's more contentious moments (looking at you, "ballistics").</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2050650/Resident_Evil_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/resident-evil-4-remake/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/resident-evil-4/9n7jcppcpn37" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. You can also take a look at our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review">review of the game here</a> if you want to know how Capcom's modernization of the 2005 classic shakes out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/plants-vs-zombies-3-going-offline-for-major-overhaul-following-soft-launch-feedback.1010832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-3-going-offline-for-major-overhaul-following-soft-launch-feedback<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Plants vs Zombies 3 will go offline and get a "major overhaul" following feedback from the app's "soft launch", which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-returns-to-mobile-with-new-sequel-out-this-year">began back in January</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The undead tower defense threequel is now no longer available to download from the iPhone App Store and Google Play, and in-game purchases have been switched off. 
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news/soft-launch-announcement-15-oct">statement</a> released today by developer PopCap gives existing players a month's notice of servers going dark for an indefinite period, beginning 15th November, from which point on the game will be unplayable. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey Neighborville residents!" the statement reads. "We've been grateful for your enthusiasm and feedback during our soft launch. 
</p>
<p>
"It's clear that we're onto something great and following the recent releases of Choose Your Seeds and the manual activation of Grapes of Wrath, we want to go even further to make the game truly special.
</p>
<p>
"That's why we're taking the game offline for a major overhaul, and we can't wait to share what's taking root!"
</p>
<p>
It's been nine months since Plants vs Zombies 3 rolled out via a "soft launch", and received a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/199hdmu/plants_vs_zombies_3_is_atrocious/">decidedly mixed response</a>. At the time, Popcap <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19aqd00/pvz3_soft_launch_an_update/">admitted</a> there were "some gameplay elements that aren't connecting so much with some people".
</p>
<p>
Over the course of this year, Popcap has continued to tweak the game with new features, and the sentiment to today's news among Plants vs Zombies fans seems hopeful, if not entirely positive.
</p>
<p>
"PvZ 3 is slowly getting better so maybe there's still some hope?" one fan said, posting in response to Popcap via the franchise's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1g4cqcs/an_announcement_about_pvz3s_soft_launch/">reddit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"It's kinda sad to see the only thing keeping the PvZ franchise alive disappear for a while, but I think it's for the best," said another. "I'd rather eventually have a game that I'll play instead of a game that exists but I don't bother playing."

<p>"We have read so many great reviews and received so many positive comments, and it’s been amazing," reads a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/astro-bot-new-speedrun-level-and-special-bots-out-tomorrow/?sf275076788=1">PlayStation Blog</a> post from Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet. "However, if there was one piece of feedback that came through loud and clear, it was that you wanted more. So rather than put our little robotic feet up just yet, we have been busily beavering away, and we have some new surprises ready for you."</p> <div>

								<p>Decades before we got married and started a family, my partner and I connected over a little Boxer pup named Charlie. We tossed a ball around, scrubbed him down when he got dirty, and took him for daily walks. It was a bonding experience — mediated entirely through the original Nintendo DS’s touchscreen. The tactile experience turned an otherwise simple game like <em>Nintendogs,</em> where the goal is to take care of virtual pets, into something that created a deep emotional connection. And years before smartphones were in everyone’s pockets, it helped show a generation of gamers just what’s possible with a touchscreen.</p>

								<p>Now, we mostly take them for granted, but prior to the arrival of the first DS in 2004, the idea of a touchscreen was, for many people (myself included), something out of science fiction. The screens I was used to being around — televisions, computer monitors, MP3 players — definitely were <em>not</em> for touching. And commercial devices like Apple’s Newton, with its handwriting tech, were financially out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>But the DS was something different. As the successor to the Game Boy, it was more of a toy than a piece of high-end tech. It took the basics of a traditional gaming handheld and doubled the screens, stacking two displays on top of each other and sticking a hinge in the middle so that you could fold it shut like a book. The most important part was the bottom screen, which could respond to touch via a fingertip or the included stylus.</p>

								<p>The oddball design of the DS made it approachable. Despite the touchscreen, it was <em>just </em>familiar enough thanks to an array of physical controls, and it had two cartridge slots so you could still bring along your old Game Boy Advance carts. One look and it was clear this gray, clamshell brick was meant for gaming. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">But it was also pretty freakin’ weird</a>.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>In typical Nintendo fashion, the company didn’t just introduce a new control method — it also went ahead and showed you its possibilities. Some of the bestselling DS games are ones that wouldn’t have been possible without that touchscreen. <em>Nintendogs</em> captivated players because of how natural it felt to rub your little pup’s head with a finger or play catch by virtually flinging a frisbee as you did your best to take care of a small group of dogs. Meanwhile, the <em>Brain Age</em> series — a collection of puzzles designed to work out your mind — showed how intuitive handwriting recognition could be for games like sudoku. Hell, <em>Brain Age</em> had millions of people doing <em>math problems for fun</em>. The company also snuck touch elements into its biggest franchises, so you could fight in a new way in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> or tap through even more bizarre minigames in <em>WarioWare</em>.</p>

								<p>Even better, because the DS was such a hit — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">the Switch may be a massive success</a>, but the original DS remains Nintendo’s bestselling piece of hardware — plenty of other developers jumped in as well. The early days of the handheld were bursting with creativity. Here’s a sampling:</p>

								<ul><li><em>Trauma Center</em>, an anime drama about doing surgery via swiping and slicing on the touchscreen, as your finger essentially becomes a scalpel</li><li><em>Professor Layton</em>, a detective-themed series of logic puzzle books, where the stylus subs in for a pencil</li><li><em>Electroplankton</em>, a musical toy where you manipulate nature — like bouncing tadpoles off of leaves or spinning strange circular fish — to create beautiful sounds</li><li><em>Scribblenauts</em>, where you can solve puzzles by writing “anything” and the game interprets your handwriting</li><li><em>Etrian Odyssey</em>, a dungeon crawler / cartography sim where you draw your own map, which takes up the entire bottom screen</li><li><em>Elite Beat Agents</em> (and its Japanese counterpart, <em>Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan</em>), where the touchscreen becomes a <em>Guitar Hero</em>-style musical instrument, forcing you to tap along to the beat</li><li><em>Cooking Mama</em>, where you chop, slice, and plate meals entirely via touch</li></ul>

								<p>The Nintendo DS eased people into the concept of touchscreens because it was also basically a Game Boy. All these touch-friendly games sat alongside titles that barely used touch or ignored it altogether, like Koji Igarashi’s excellent <em>Castlevania</em> run, or role-playing games like <em>Dragon Quest</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>. This allowed Nintendo to slowly introduce the idea of interacting with a screen via touch to millions of people, long before the idea became an integral part of modern life. And you can draw a pretty straight line from its launch to the golden days of early iPhone games like <em>Rolando</em>, <em>Tiny Wings</em>, <em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em>, and <em>World of Goo</em>, which were similarly full of invention and playfulness. In fact, several hit DS titles, like <em>Cooking Mama </em>and <em>Scribblenauts</em>, eventually made their way to mobile. The transition was almost seamless. Even Nintendo eventually made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/15/13961146/super-mario-run-review-nintendo-mobile-app-iphone-ipad">a mobile <em>Super Mario</em> game you play by tapping</a>.</p>

								<p>Two decades later, a touchscreen is an assumed part of almost any gaming device. It’s become so pervasive that it would be weird if modern hardware like the Switch or PlayStation Portal <em>didn’t</em> have touchscreens. What was once novel to me has since become the norm; when I passed down an old DS to my oldest kid, she wasn’t shocked or amazed that she could pet a virtual pup. It’s what she was used to. But that also made her the ideal person to adopt Charlie, who has been waiting inside of that cartridge for the last 20 years.</p>

November 15, 2024 is the final day to play. After that, the servers go offline and Plants vs. Zombies 3 will be inaccessible in all territories.</p><p>Any earned or purchased coin balances as of November 15, 2024 will be saved as long as you've connected your account through Google Play, Apple ID, or your EA Account. Boosts, game progress (including levels and unlocked units), and narrative will all be reset.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia is a 2024 free-to-play tower defense mobile game developed by EA-owned PopCap Games and published by EA on iPhone and Android in January this year. That followed a soft launch in select regions in 2020, a re-work and subsequent re-launch in April 2022, then another soft-launch in October 2022. A worldwide launch was then planned for later in 2024, but clearly PopCap is still working to get to the root of the game’s issues.</p><p>EA said it’s now “excited to re-tool” the game and “bring you an even better PvZ3 experience soon.”</p><p>“We’ve been grateful for your enthusiasm and feedback during our soft launch,” EA said. “We’ve always had love for our plants, and yes, even our zombies, and it has been a joy bringing life to Dave, his niece, Patrice, Nate, and many more in PvZ3. It’s clear that we’re onto something great and following the recent releases of Choose Your Seeds and the manual activation of Grapes of Wrath, we want to go even further to make the game truly special.</p><p>“That’s why we’re taking the game offline for a major overhaul, and we can’t wait to share what’s taking root!”</p><p>The Plants vs. Zombies franchise has suffered a difficult time in recent years, with various spin-offs failing to replicate the phenomenal popularity of the first two games. Fans often call on EA to release a third game in the third-person shooter spin-off series Garden Warfare, which has been dormant since the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/plants-vs-zombies-battle-for-neighborville">Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville</a> in 2019.</p><p>A canceled single-player Plants vs. Zombies game had been in the works within EA from about 2015 to 2017. Read all about what happened to that in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-a-plants-vs-zombies-game-died-so-a-star-wars-game-could-live-and-then-also-die">a special IGN investigation</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-3-title-update-3-makes-some-much-needed-balance-changes-nerfs-overpowered-trivelas-and-5-at-the-back-formation-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>EA Sports has released a significant balance update for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">FC 25</a> addressing some of the key issues with the game.</p><p>Since FC 25 launched last month, players have complained about a number of gameplay issues that have made competitive play frustrating, including overpowered Trivelas (shots taken with the outside of the foot) and a much-maligned five at the back formation that was incredibly difficult to break down.</p><p>Title Update 3, which is rolling out now across all platforms, addresses those concerns with sweeping balance changes to many aspects of gameplay.</p><p>The accuracy of Trivelas, for example, is “greatly reduced,” and the width of the defensive line for five defender formations is “greatly increased,” which will hopefully open up space. Meanwhile, first-time lobbed through passes are nerfed, as are driven passes.</p><p>There’s a general boost to attacking play, too, with attacking runs for AI players in certain roles given a shot in the arm among other tweaks. This will hopefully make attacking more effective in-game. Those annoying offsides should hopefully calm down, too, with improved AI player recognition of offside situations.</p><p>Elsewhere, there are fixes for various bugs and improved referee decision making when calling for fouls and penalty kicks. FC 25’s refs had become the focus of ridicule for failing to give obvious penalties in-game.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25s-first-live-tuning-update-patches-out-exploit-that-was-ruining-competitive-play">EA Sports issued <u>FC 25</u>'s first live tuning update</a>, which patched out an exploit that was ruining competitive play. Live tuning lets EA Sports roll out some changes without requiring a full title update like today’s. The developer said it can make tuning changes “faster and with more frequency while working on the balance of the game.”</p><p>Wondering what's changed in FC 25? Here's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/EA_FC_25_Changes:_Everything_New"><u>list of everything new</u></a> - we've also got the <a

For Black Ops 6, however, Activision has changed its approach so that Warzone is a separate download on PC, which has resulted in the more manageable 102 GB SSD storage requirement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PC Preload Launch Times</h2><p>Activision confirmed those who have preordered Black Ops 6 digitally on PC can preload the game before its October 25 launch date, which means they’ll be able to play the moment it goes live.</p><p>Preloading itself kicks off for everyone at 9am PT on October 21.

It launches regionally for Microsoft PC players (PC Microsoft Store) on October 24 between 4am PT and 11pm PT, which means midnight wherever you are (it’s the same for PlayStation and Xbox).

                <p>After a nearly 10-year hiatus between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is finally going to arrive at the end of the month. Unfortunately for gamers who want to avoid spoilers, The Veilguard's achievements list has leaked a few weeks early. Anyone who wants to preserve all possible surprises should steer clear of them entirely.</p><p>The Veilguard's achievements have shown up on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1g3lq6t/dav_spoilers_dragon_age_the_veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> thread and in other places online. While we won't be sharing any spoilers in this post, the story-progression achievements appear to be biggest offenders when it comes to ruining any shocks ahead. There are also the prerequisite collectible achievements as well as some that are specific to members of the player's party. </p><p>It's not unlike a film's soundtrack getting released early with spoilers in the track titles, as exemplified by the 1999 release of John Williams' score for Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. The Veilguard is a more personal experience for players, but some of the turning points in the story are going to happen for everyone. It's probably going to be more fun if players aren't looking too far ahead for any twists that await.</p><p>There are certain things that BioWare does want players to know ahead of time, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-times-and-preloading-information-revealed/1100-6527170/" data-ref-id="1100-6527170">launch times for The Veilguard</a>, preloading info, and the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fear-not-dragon-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-0-spiders/1100-6527078/" data-ref-id="1100-6527078">spiders have been excluded</a> from this game. But there will be plenty of other monsters and creatures to fight as players return to Thedas.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After rumors surfaced of a potential shutdown for Ubisoft's free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xdefiant/" data-ref-id="5000-534971">XDefiant</a>, the game's executive producer, Mark Rubin, says the leak is not true and that Year 2 content is still being planned.</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent rumor of XDefiant's suggested turmoil comes from known leaker <a href="https://x.com/just4leaks2/status/1845932877164286102" rel="nofollow ">Shaun Weber</a>, who posted a tweet claiming that the game is "already dead." Weber elaborated by saying, "Ubisoft research team is actively asking their tester to have another in-house test session and give/repeat their feedback. Multiple sources said that it's possible that the game will end its support after Season 4 if they can't get enough players."</p><p dir="ltr">XDefiant's Mark Rubin has responded to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" rel="nofollow ">refute the claims by tweeting</a>, "To be crystal clear there are NO plans to shut down after Season 4.
