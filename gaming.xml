<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161449/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>While it presents itself as a chilled-out ode to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">Legend of Zelda</a>–style adventuring and the Game Boy aesthetic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a> is more than meets the eye.</p>
<p>It opens with an ominous dream in which your protagonist is told, “If it can’t be seen, it does not exist.” From there, the game drops you into a very familiar scenario.</p>
<p>You wake up in your house, greet your mother, and step out into a small village that will feel instantly recognisable to anyone who has played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> or any given Zelda title. It is so familiar, in fact, that you would be forgiven for rolling your eyes and dismissing Wonderland Kazakiri’s creation as just another homage to Nintendo classics.</p>
<p>That assumption does not last long. Your first dungeon (actually more of a basement) presents a progress block with a static, isometric corridor and a stubborn snail in the way. Instead of fighting it, you are instructed to flip the camera and make the snail stop existing altogether. A tap of the shoulder button and the whole world rotates on its axis, offering an entirely new viewpoint.</p>

<p>Cassette Boy is a game about perspective. The developers call it a "Schrödinger System". Traversal, combat, and puzzles all hinge on your ability to rotate the environment and cause objects, enemies, or hazards to cease to exist.</p>
<p>In that sense, it is like The Legend of Zelda, if Lizalfos were constantly at risk of their quantum superposition collapsing.</p>
<p>There’s another homage to note here. The dimensional shifting, paired with chilled-out chiptune beats, recalls Phil Fish’s classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fez">FEZ</a>. That game offered an intoxicating world to explore with very little concern for traditional narrative structure. Cassette Boy leans more toward the generic side when it comes to its adventure.</p>
<p>Setting out from the hub town, our hero collects weapons and power-ups, explores caves and dungeons, and hunts down fragments of the moon to reassemble it. There is nothing particularly exciting about the story being told here, and it rarely surprises.</p>
<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161442/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The real hook lies in the often ingenious puzzle mechanics. Every enemy and environmental hazard is vulnerable to being obscured by camera rotation. Early on, this simply means erasing obstacles from your path. As the game progresses, however, you are required to make increasingly sharp logic leaps to move forward.</p>
<p>Switches stop functioning when they disappear. Deadly spike traps become harmless when obscured from view. Some devices in a room will only trigger after the camera has been rotated a specific number of times.</p>
<p>This can be deeply disorienting, especially during boss battles that are built entirely around this mechanic, but it is also where Cassette Boy is at its most clever and confident. After its initial tutorial quest and boss battle, the game stops holding your hand. Much like the titles that inspired it, you’re free to poke around the edges of a relatively open world.</p>

<p>Progression is neither linear nor truly open, and it’s easy to get lost wondering where to go next, especially at the start, when you’re still acclimating to the shifting perspective. Luckily, any frustration is offset by the calming nature of green.</p>
<p>The game’s other creative flourish is the viridescent splendour of its Game Boy-like visual style. The initially harsh glow of the colour scheme gives way to a flood of childhood memories. It looks surprisingly sharp on a big screen, easier on the eye than you might expect. Rotating the camera from flat to blocky is fluid; it’s consistently satisfying to see those ancient handheld visuals shift into another dimension. Undocked is much more comfortable, though, if only because it feels like this style should always be depicted on a smaller display.</p>
<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161444/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a shame that the adventure itself isn't as compelling as the visuals and puzzling. Even with some snappy NPC dialogue, this is a journey you’ve taken countless times before.</p>
<p>While the roster of enemies is pleasingly odd at times, fighting them is pretty dull. Sword slashes and charged range shots are the order of the day for monsters that can't be sent into the void with a flip of the camera. There is a neat quirk with the ability set in which staggered tutorial prompts let you know of abilities you already had. This felt reminiscent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tunic">Tunic</a>, a game that also wore its influences on its sleeve.</p>
<p>For all its shortcomings and liberal borrowing from better titles, though, it’s worth considering that, as a budget release asking a fraction of what others charge for similar — and often less innovative — experiences, Cassette Boy is still worth picking up.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A familiar adventure that pulls from the likes of Zelda and Pokémon for its setting and story, Cassette Boy is nevertheless a smart puzzler with a great visual style. The dimension-shifting mechanic never gets old, putting a fresh and literal spin on traditional isometric questing.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While there hasn't been a new main entry in the series in a long time - not counting the 2018's MMO - the Fallout series is more popular than ever thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Amazon Prime TV Show</strong></a>. The adaptation effectively rejuvenated the franchise, attracting millions of new players to its post-apocalyptic world and prompting them to explore older titles, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong>.</p>



<p>The series' resurgence has also breathed new life into an old debate among the community: the "purist" first two entries versus the first-person RPGs developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Bethesda Game Studios</strong>. According to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Chris Avellone</strong>, the lead developer of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> - which many feel is the true successor to the original top-down games - the series' current direction has a simple reason: Bethesda doesn't fully understand its roots. Nor does it care.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009457239694954576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009457239694954576%7Ctwgr%5Ebe45c50dada723054da89576b40cc48a3f92b2b1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Ffallout%2Fi-dont-think-bethesda-hates-fallout-says-new-vegas-lead-they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care%2F"><strong>Replying to a fan's question regarding whether Bethesda "hates" the original series on X</strong></a>, Avellone was remarkably clear: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"I don’t think Bethesda hates Fallout, they just don’t fully understand its roots and arguably, don’t care - they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm."</em></p>



<p>This lack of deeper connection is what Avellone believes fuels the series' current design philosophy. <em>"This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout – and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me,"</em> Avellone pointed out.</p>



<p>Although these statements sound harsh, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</strong> </em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong> veteran clarified that he doesn't hate Bethesda, highlighting some of their strengths. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"There are things they do well (open world exploration), and there are things they do badly (telling linear stories in open world games and their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill). But every developer has their pros and cons,"</em> Avellone concluded.</p>



<p>As someone who loves the first two entries and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout </strong></em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong>, but could never really get into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4</em></strong>, I can only agree with Avellone's sentiment. While the Bethesda entries are undeniably solid open-world RPGs, they often feel like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</em> games only on the surface, missing those small elements that made the original games and the Obsidian title truly memorable.</p>



<p>Standing as one of the best modern entries in the series, a remastered <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> would be an extremely welcome release to tide fans over until the release of the inevitable fifth entry, which may not see the light of day for a long time, with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/"><strong>Bethesda still hard at work on </strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong></a>.

			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> signed a 10-year deal with <strong>Nintendo</strong></a> that promised to bring <strong>Call of Duty</strong> to Team Red's console in order to help get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard across the finish line, technically speaking, seeing the shooter franchise arrive on the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> (or more likely, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) has been a sure thing.</p>



<p>We're four years into that deal, and still no Call of Duty on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, but a recent datamine spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-on-nintendo-switch-datamine">Eurogamer</a> seems to indicate that the shooter's arrival on the platform is "<em>imminent</em>."</p>



<p>Dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/2010381277011284375">Realityuk</a>, who has previously shared accurate datamined files related to Call of Duty updates, spotted a mention of Nintendo in the launcher code the last time they delved into Call of Duty HQ, and believes it is an indication that we'll see the official announcement the next time Nintendo hosts a major event. </p>



<p>This datamine comes just three weeks after a report pointing to Call of Duty arriving on Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/">sometime in 2026, potentially launching "<em>in a few months</em>."</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Back in 2022, when Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, was first talking about the deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo's console,<a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-bringing-call-of-duty-to-switch-will-require-time/"> he admitted that it</a> "<em></em><em>would likely take a little bit of time</em>" to make the port happen. </p>



<p>Now that it has been "<em>a little bit of time</em>" since that deal was inked, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is not just a poorly-kept secret but the latest console on the market, it seems like we are coming very close to seeing the world's most popular shooter franchise arrive on the hybrid console.</p>



<p>Regardless, at least it's not a question of 'if' but just a question of 'when.' Hopefully, we'll hear more official news soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hytale </em>developer Hypixel Studios has announced that pre-purchases of the upcoming voxel-based sandbox RPG have already covered two years of the game's development, so it looks like the future is bright for the once-ill-fated project.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">message on X</a>, Hypixel's Simon Collins-Laflamme says the studio has "officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases", so even if nobody else were to buy <em>Hytale </em>now, it would be supported for at least that long.</p><p>Additionally, Collins-Laflamme says he's committed to supporting and working on <em>Hytale </em>for ten years as a "personal commitment", closing by saying his studio and the game are "looking very strong for the future".</p><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Hytale </em>is covered for at least the next two years.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In case you need a reminder, <em>Hytale </em>is a sandbox RPG that began life as a specialized <em>Minecraft </em>server run by Collins-Laflamme and his fellow Hypixel staffers before being spun off into its own (rather ambitious!) project in 2018.</p><p>In 2020, Riot Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cce18a43-847f-48af-84f2-b986b2f91e4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">purchased Hypixel</a> and the rights to <em>Hytale</em>, but in June last year, the <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Valorant </em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d7a83480-b8b4-4d84-9282-580c367fefa6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced that it was shutting Hypixel down</a> and canceling <em>Hytale</em>'s development.</p><p>Initially, that seemed like the end of the story, but in November, Collins-Laflamme and some of the original Hypixel staffers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="067e1363-c5fc-4311-97f7-059f8a0d8810" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced that they had revived the studio</a> and were back working on <em>Hytale </em>again.</p><p>Following that, <em>Hytale </em>received an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a5ca1af-847d-401f-92a0-bf49ffc1da92" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Early Access release date of January 13th</a>, so it's less than a day until you can check it out for yourself and see what the game's epic struggle has wrought.</p>
<p>Given how many people have already pre-purchased <em>Hytale</em>, I'd imagine things can only get better for Hypixel from here on out, especially if the Early Access release is well-received (although the studio has attempted to <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">set expectations</a> on this front accordingly).</p><p>If you'd like to join in the fun, you can pre-purchase <em>Hytale </em><a href="https://hytale.com/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right here</a> (or just wait until tomorrow, when it officially launches in Early Access). Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>As we sit in the comfortable denial that lets us believe it’s games like <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Battlefield 6 </em>that are the most popular out there, earning the most attention and the most play time from the most players, pesky reality maintains its own truth, in which truly gargantuan numbers of people are playing Roblox and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> fan-games you’ve likely never heard of. <em>Fish It!</em>, a&nbsp;Roblox game, <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/121864768012064/">saw nearly 28 million players yesterday</a>, with 1.4 million playing at the same time. At the same time, <em>Fortnite</em>‘s creator-made&nbsp;<em>Steal the Brainrot</em>, itself a version of a wildly popular Roblox game, saw a record 1.09 million concurrent players. And as of last week’s changes to <em>Fortnite</em> which allow creators to implement microtransactions, it also introduced both super-expensive items and gambling!</p> <p>In a game called&nbsp;<em>Steal a Brainrot</em>, it’s perhaps hard to expect anything less. The original Roblox game<!--StartFragment --><span>—which you’ll note has a slightly different title than its <em>Fortnite </em>imitator<!--StartFragment -->—<!--EndFragment --></span>was based on the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/italian-brainrot-ai-italian-animals">Italian brainrot meme</a> that was big in 2025. In the game, players could either buy or steal weird-looking animals, which generated in-game money through ownership.&nbsp; At one point it saw a record-breaking 25 million concurrent users—more than half the number of players <em>every game on Steam</em> has ever seen at once. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">it’s ghastly</a>—ask anyone with a kid who played it and you’ll hear tales of their distraught misery after their most expensive Brainrots were stolen. This, of course, is by design.</p>

 <p>The game manifested in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>as <em>Steal the Brainrot</em> in July of last year and immediately became one of the most popular player-created games, doing a lot to raise awareness that <em>Fortnite</em> even offered such options for creators. But until this weekend, it could only offer a money-less simulacrum. Within 24 hours of a change to the game’s regulations allowing microtransactions in user-created games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-fortnite-enables-third-party-microtransactions-steal-the-brainrots-developer-is-slammed-by-fans-for-immediately-adding-45-premium-bundles-and-gambling-style-mechanics">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, <em>Steal the Brainrot</em> was charging 4,900 V-Bucks (around $35) for the “Lucky Rot” bundle, a lootbox option that only <em>might&nbsp;</em>contain a rare brainrot animal-thing.</p>

   <p>Epic’s approach to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> and the ways in which players are able to create their own game modes is very much modeled on the eye-watering popularity of Roblox. But until very recently, Epic wasn’t allowing its audience to monetize those creations, giving Roblox a hefty edge among those hoping to catch the incredibly brief flashes of lightning in a bottle. Last Friday, that changed, and in that recognizable Epic style, the option was launched with a far better cut of the profits for developers than is typically offered elsewhere. (The Epic Games Store takes 12 percent of a game’s sales, compared to Steam and others’ 30 percent.)</p>

 <p>Known as “islands” on&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, those player-created games have been given access to developer tools for adding microtransactions <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers">since November of last year</a>, with the switch-on date set for January 9, 2026. Deliberately aimed at scooping Roblox, 100 percent of the value of V-Bucks spent in a given game will go directly to creators until January 31, 2027, dropping to a still solid 50 percent after that. (Confusingly, this isn’t representative of actual spend due to platform fees—<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-overview-in-fortnite?lang=en-US#monetizationandpayouts">the full breakdown is here</a>, but it essentially works out to 74 percent of money spent for the first year, then 37 percent afterward, largely due to the 30 percent cut taken by console owners.)</p>

 <p>Alongside&nbsp;<em>Steal the Brainrot</em>‘s new lootboxes is a straight-up gambling wheel. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/fortnite-gambling-feature-outrage-483800-20260112"><em>Gaming Bible</em></a> notes, many are calling this out as unambiguously being a slot machine. You spend 100 V-Bucks (roughly a dollar) and you get to spin the wheel, with prizes including in-game items or currency. And given <em>STB</em> is obviously primarily aimed at children, this is…it’s not great, is it?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite, a children's game, now features slot machines that cost real money to play. <a href="https://t.co/Qa7DkEZ8CO">pic.twitter.com/Qa7DkEZ8CO</a></p> <p>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2010562630763610589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s definitely reductive to describe&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> as a whole as “a children’s game” as some have been doing. While it certainly is popular with a younger demographic, it still has a sizeable adult audience too. But when it comes to stealing brainrots, let’s be real: it’s overwhelmingly pre-teens being encouraged to play the odds, shelling out cash for a spin of the wheel or a box that&nbsp;<em>might&nbsp;</em>have something of use in it.</p>

<p>A Pokémon&nbsp;and LEGO pairing was inevitable. The two media mammoths have finally come together to deliver a range of stunning LEGO sets, bringing out the best of brick-building and beloved ‘Mon. This guide has details on every Pokémon set, how much each one costs, and how to order them.</p>



<p>March 18 was a historic day as it was the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO x Pokémon partnership.</a> The era of Pokémon x Mega Bloks is sadly over, but as one legacy ends, a new one begins. LEGO has long been at the forefront of the premium, brick-building pastime.</p>



<p>The first-ever LEGO Pokémon Sets took a while to emerge from Viridian Forest, but they’re in the wild.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-lego-pokemon-set">Every LEGO Pokémon Set</h2>



<h3 id="h-eevee">Eevee</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eevee is set #72151 and requires you to battle with 587 pierces to complete. This is likely only the beginning of the Eevee line, with the Eeveelutions surely to follow. For now, enjoy one of the cutest and most adorable Pokémon ever created.</p>







<h3 id="h-pikachu-and-poke-ball">Pikachu and Poké Ball</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>Could you really have the first-ever LEGO Pokémon sets and not include at least one Pikachu model? This set is number #72152, has 2,050 pieces, and ensures the face of the franchise is featured in this fresh chapter.</p>



<h3 id="h-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now for the fun part: Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise. It was back in 2025 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-prices-have-possibly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon prices leaked and included a $649.99</a> item. The rumors were true, and the monstrous starter evolution set (#72153) has 6,838 pieces! </p>



<h3 id="h-kanto-region-badge-collection">Kanto Region Badge Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>#40892 is the Kanto Region Badge Collection, and is one of two items that can’t be purchased. Its 312 pieces are reserved for customers who purchase the LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set—a heavy price for greatness.</p>



<h3 id="h-mini-pokemon-center">Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>The fifth and final set in the first LEGO Pokémon collection is the Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center—otherwise known as #40911. Again, just like the Kanto Region Badge Collection set, you can’t buy this beauty outright. More on this below.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-pre-order-lego-pokemon-sets">How To Pre-Order LEGO Pokémon Sets</h2>



<p><strong>To pre-order LEGO Pokémon Sets, you need to either go directly to the official LEGO online store in your region or find an applicable outlet that stocks LEGO Pokémon Sets.</strong></p>



<p>The official LEGO website is the handy hub for all LEGO Pokémon sets. A dedicated <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Pokémon</a> section has all the sets you can buy, and information on the special mini-sets. Do note that everything will usually be full price here, but you can score LEGO Insiders Points with every purchase—used to get discounts on future sets, gain access to unique sets, and earn rewards.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can pop into nearby physical stores to see if you can pre-order any of the LEGO Pokémon Sets to pick up in person, and there’s the option to pre-order using a different online outlet.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-do-lego-pokemon-sets-cost-price-amp-how-to-get-explained">How Much Do LEGO Pokémon Sets Cost? Price &amp; How To Get, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The first LEGO Pokémon sets range from $59.99 to a whopping $649.99 for the most expensive</strong> <strong>set.</strong></p>



<p>A major and obvious downside was always going to happen with official LEGO Pokémon sets: High costs that get much bigger the more advanced the set gets.</p>



<p>To make this easy, here’s a handy table showing the Pokémon sets with all necessary details.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">LEGO Pokémon Set Name</th><th data-align="center">How To Get</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eevee</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 / £54.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu and Poké Ball</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 / £179.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$579.99 / £9.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kanto Region Badge Collection</td><td data-align="center">Special gift with purchases of the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set.</td><td data-align="center">Not available to purchase.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center</td><td data-align="center">Can be bought for 2,500 LEGO Insiders Points.</td><td data-align="center">Not available to purchase.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/code-violet-reviews-metacritic-opencritic-dino-crisis-2000658906</link>
            <guid>1403491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every year needs its marquee bad game, and just two weeks into 2026, it looks like the new yeare might already have a contender. </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>is a survival horror game from TeamKill Media, the team who made the apparently also awful </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/quantum-error/"><i><span>Quantum Error</span></i></a><span> from 2023. Both games are currently sitting at a 40 on review aggregate site Metacritic, and given that </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>only has a handful of reviews thus far, there’s still time for the dinosaur-shooting </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>knockoff to tumble down farther in the ranks.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> mixes the claustrophobic corridors and over-the-shoulder shooting of games like </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span> with the dinosaur-infested setting of </span><i><span>Dino Crisis</span></i><span>. Or it tries to, at least. From the sound of it, the game doesn’t pull any of this off anywhere near as well as the games it’s clearly trying to emulate, and its simplistic shooting never quite manages to make its dinosaur foes feel terrifying enough to overpower you.</span></p>

 <p><span>“In a straight up skirmish with these scaly foes, a well-timed dash back can really befuddle the raptors, shattering their simple gameplan of running at you, taking a big swing, pausing, and doing it again,” Jarrett Jawn writes at </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>. “There’s limited space before you hit a wall or a door that might have automatically closed behind you, though, so you can only backdash so much before making yourself a much easier snack to catch. The camera will collide with these barriers far sooner than [protagonist] Violet will, rendering any encounter that doesn’t take place in the dead center of the room a completely unintelligible mess for as long as it takes you to get the camera refocused.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Several reviewers state that everything about </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s combat seems undercooked in a way that makes it hard to even interpret visually or through audio cues. </span><i><span>PushSquare </span></i><span>reviewer John Cal McCormick, meanwhile, described the shooting as “limp” and its guns “weightless.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Shotguns should boom, but firing one in </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> feels like when you bite the end of the paper off a McDonald’s straw and blow through it so the wrapping flies off,” McCormick writes.&nbsp; </span><span><br> </span><span>“Less of a boom, and more of a wildly unsatisfying thwip. Hit boxes seem erratic, and visual feedback is largely non-existent. It’s often unclear if you’re actually hitting your target or not until the dinosaur you’re shooting at unconvincingly keels over.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Outside of the actual pointing and shooting, several reviewers noted the odd tonal dissonance between the game’s survival horror setting and the way it frames its protagonist Violet, with her&nbsp; fanservice-driven wardrobe and </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s insistence on giving players an unimpeded view quickly growing tiresome, corny, and at odds with the moment at hand.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Although the character model is highly detailed, it is done so in a sexualised manner, which is further enhanced through the array of revealing costumes that you can dress her in at save points,” </span><a href="https://cogconnected.com/review/code-violet-review/"><i><span>COGConnected</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> Jaz Sagoo writes.</span></p> <p><span>“In a pivotal moment in the story, Violet bawls at the death of a comrade,” McCormick says. “The comrade was killed by a space dinosaur, incidentally. And as the tears stream down her face, and the voice actor puts their all into each wail, the camera pans back to reveal Violet is dressed like a sexy cowgirl complete with arse-less chaps.”</span></p>

 <p><span>If you scroll down to the comments on most of these reviews, you’ll find that a lot of folks aren’t terribly surprised by this, given </span><i><span>Quantum Error </span></i><span>was also a certified stinker. There are also plenty of people saying what they really want is for Capcom to bring back </span><i><span>Dino Crisis </span></i><span>so we can get a real dinosaur horror game instead of these knock-offs. But from the sound of it, you’re better off waiting for Capcom to pull the franchise out of cold storage than playing </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <p>A lot of you are gaming hard, it seems. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> has been on a steady growth trajectory for years now, with the Covid pandemic alone adding five million unique users only in 2020. On 1th January, Valve's platform crossed the 42 million barrier, setting a new record.</p>
<p>As reported and explained by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/">Wccftech</a>, the PC distribution platform has now more than doubled its concurrent user average since 2020, with new record peaks of activity becoming more and more common in recent years. The previous activity record was 41.6 million users in October 2025.</p>
<p>The full analysis solidifies the feeling that Steam (and PC gaming as a whole) has blown up in popularity in the post-pandemic era: "A quick data analysis reveals distinct growth phases during this period. Before the pandemic, the Steam platform was growing slowly, at a rate of +4.5 percent per year. The lockdown year obviously exploded the platform (as well as all other gaming platforms) with +31.5 percent in a single year, followed by a stabilisation phase and the current phase, which are both between 13.9 percent and 12.6 percent annual growth rate."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">Last month also was Steam's highest-grossing yet</a>, partly thanks to recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-expeditions-one-in-ten">Arc Raiders</a> and viral indie sensations like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Peak</a>, on top of everything else. The quality of the more recent Steam sales has also been on the upswing, often countering the deep deals found on other storefronts.</p><p>Another reason behind this growth is the rising popularity of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a>, Valve's portable PC that's cracked open PC gaming for plenty of folks who wanted the benefits of Steam and other platforms without the technical hassles which typically come with gaming computers. Even with its technical limitations, it’s become the go-to "console" for plenty of more casual players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/">Epic Games Store has also seen plenty of growth</a> over six years, but as we expected, most users only show up for the free games given out each week, refusing to spend money on a platform that isn’t nearly as fleshed out as Valve’s beyond the games themselves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>After a ten year run, My Hero Academia’s superhero high school drama has come to an end. The manga wrapped up its story in 2024, the anime adaptation aired its eighth and final season at the end of 2025, and now in 2026 it’s time for the video game series to smash through to its conclusion with My Hero Academia: All’s Justice.</p>
<p><iframe title="MY HERO ACADEMIA: All’s Justice | WE ARE HERE Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tA3j0dUkU0I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main draw for All’s Justice is to get to play through and experience this final story arc of My Hero Academia. There’s a fair bit of required knowledge because of this, like “Who’re these All For One and One For All fellows?” and “Wait, there’s a frog girl and a pervy boy with sticky balls for hair?” There’s also a real feeling that, if you’ve not kept up with the story so far, you’ll want to go back and catch up, whether you do so via the previous two games –&nbsp;One’s Justice and One’s Justice 2 –&nbsp;or work your way through the source materials.</p>


<p>Still, given that it’s the final showdown, you should know roughly what to expect, as it builds up to one climactic battle between Midoriya and All For One. Along the way, there’ll be other big narrative beats for other key characters and heroes, and no doubt a few noble sacrifices. It’s one of these battles that we got to experience, with the bull-headed Bakugo taking on All For One. It’s a titanic battle, set amidst a ruined chunk of the city, and mixing together animated scenes with the super-powered combat at the core of this game. Given that it’s Bakugo fighting, this chunk of the story is suitably filled with explosions.</p>


<p>The combat system remains familiar from the previous two games in the series, and this genre in general. You nip around a 3D battle arena looking to get into position to unleash a string of close-quarters hits, make the most of your particular character’s Quirk abilities, including their cinematic Plus Ultra attack, and keep a watchful eye for when you need to guard, counter or dodge incoming attacks. There’s the typical cat and mouse of trying to close the gap to enemies, with the AI sometimes keeping a quite frustrating amount of distance when you’ve got a generally close combat character, like Bakugo with his explosive fists.</p>
<p>What’s new for this game is the Rising meter. This builds up as you fight, and once filled lets you trigger a souped up version of your fighter, boosting their attack power, movement speed and recovery speed. It gives you a good boost, coming with a little cinematic and a change in stance or form. For Bakugo, his shoulder blasters come up, for Izuku he engages his armoured fists into a more powerful mode, for Fumikage, his Dark Shadow grows and takes centre stage to absolutely batter enemies.</p>

<p>This really comes to the fore in the full 3v3 battling, where you get to choose three characters and switch back and forth between them, adapting character abilities and play styles as you go. There’s a tactical element to choosing when and where to use Rising, just as much as there is for using a Plus Ultra attack, or saving that up to use multiple charges in a multi-character Plus Ultra Combo.</p>
<p>Through the game are two control modes, with the “Normal Control” mode the default which is recommended for beginners where a single button is all that’s needed while your character dynamically unleashes combos, Quirks and Plus Ultra moves. I personally found the “Manual Control” mode gave me much better results, as I had more control over what my character was doing.</p>
<p>Away from the story mode, the game is wrapped up in an open world area virtual space which you can explore in a number of ways. The Team Up Mission mode presents a whole host of scenarios for you to take a team of three into. Confronting the Formidable, for example, takes a battle from the story and rewrites it as a training scenario for Midoriya created by teacher Eraser Head. It does go a bit sideways, though, when the AI characters that have been created go rogue…</p>

<p>The main problem I found with this was that there felt like there was a chunk of filler in this scenario. It’s a handful of fairly tame battles, some lame chase scenes where you’re running down an alley filled with barrels and metal bars, and then random encounters when going between mission points in the open world. I have to hope that other Team Up Missions are more engaging, but there was a bit of fun to be had in the scenario.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Hero’s Diary mode (which is unlocked by completing the Team Up Mission mode) cuts out the chaff and features original mini-stories for a bunch of the supporting characters from Class 1-A. Each character memory has three segments, which are either a cutscene, battle or some kind of exploration or other task. Minoru Mineta has to try to race through checkpoints by mastering the parkour possibilities of his hair balls, Mina Ashido just wants to find cats in a playground, Eijiro Kirishima has a boisterous battle to prove he’s the toughest character of them all.</p>
<p>As My Hero Academia: All’s Justice looks to wrap up this series narrative in explosive fashion, the fresh additions of Rising and Plus Ultra Combo are going to bring an added layer to the 3V3 combat. I’m a little less convinced about how essential the additional modes and open world are going to be, but they are there as asides to the core pillars of this finale, giving more characters their time in the spotlight.</p>

            <guid>1403467</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Tom Clancy's The Division</strong> initially launched on PC, PS4, and Xbox One on March 8, 2016, meaning that March 8, 2026, will mark the 10-year anniversary of the series launch. It's not entirely clear how <strong>Ubisoft</strong> intends to celebrate the occasion yet, but a poster spotted at the esports event, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6JP/status/1996490814843740451">FPS Day,</a> in Japan seems to have one indication of how, as event attendees shared pictures of a <strong><em>"The Division: Definitive Edition"</em></strong> poster online.</p>



<p>Shared to X (formerly Twitter) by multiple users, a large poster for The Division: Definitive Edition that seems to be legitimate was shared ahead of a 10th anniversary panel taking place at the event.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A 'Definitive Edition' of the first Division game has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, though we do know that there are several projects within the series in the works. At last week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> executive producer <strong>Julian Gerighty</strong> shared some new information and gameplay on The Division 2: Survivors and The Division Resurgence, two upcoming titles that were first announced at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>.</p>



<p>He also spared <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">a few words for <strong>The Division 3</strong>,</a> saying, "<em></em><em>It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear what the 'Definitive Edition' of the initial game will look like, particularly because Ubisoft has already been adding new features to The Division to help celebrate the game's 10-year anniversary, like a <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505">60 FPS update for current-gen consoles that was released almost a month ago</a> at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>A video shared by the <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/2010628433223545297">official Ubisoft Japan X (formerly Twitter) account</a> also details how the company will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first Division game with a special in-game event in The Division 2, but there's no mention of a 'Definitive Edition' for the first The Division game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this 'Definitive Edition' is a new version of the first Division game set to release for current-gen platforms, then we may only be hours away from the official confirmation at the aforementioned 10th anniversary panel. Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on what's happening, but did not receive a reply ahead of publishing. We'll update this article if/when we hear back.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-pill-is-now-the-most-affordable-way-to-get-an-apple-portable-bluetooth-speaker-after-a-new-year-price-cut-2000658301</link>
            <guid>1403458</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can instantly lift the mood and the vibe of any space. Those shopping for a solid Bluetooth speaker today – we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Beats Pill speaker by 33%, offering it now for just $100.</a> That’s after a nice $50 savings, and the offer applies to all color options. These include the stunning Champagne, the classic Black, and the bold Red.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Compromises on Sound</h2>
<p>Beats Pill – well, looks like a large pill, but in a good, minimal way. The speaker includes a removable lanyard and soft-grip silicone backing for easier portability. It can be slipped into any bag or simply carried using the lanyard when you’re heading out.</p>
<p>Sound quality is nothing short of impressive. Beats Pill features a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that displaces 90% more air volume for deeper bass, plus a redesigned tweeter which offers crisp highs and rich mid-range tones. The result? Balanced, yet punchy sound for all your favorite tracks. Whether you’re starting your day with a motivational podcast or want your music to match your workout energy, expect an immersive sound experience. Conversations come through clearly, while tunes hit with satisfying bass that moves you.</p>
<p>Even better, the woofer’s material and structure are designed to minimize low-end distortion, even when you have pumped the sound all the way up. Feeling like having your own private Coldplay concert in your lounge? Push the volume to maximum to get in the feels. Additionally, the Beats Pill supports not only Bluetooth connectivity but also USB-C connections to other devices. The latter offers high-resolution lossless audio, which preserves the detail and depth of audio, letting you enjoy the music exactly the way its creator intended. You can even pair two of these speakers together for an even larger sound setup in Amplify mode or Stereo mode. Just ask a friend to bring theirs, connect the two, and get the party started.</p>



<p>Note that despite Beats being owned by Apple, this speaker plays nicely with both Android and Apple devices. You can connect it to your smartphone, laptop, computer, TV, and more without a problem. Best of all, the included microphone lets you take calls and activate voice assistants like Alexa and Google right through the speaker. Once you’re done, your track picks up right where you left off.</p>
<p>Durability comes from the speaker’s IP67 dust and water resistance, which makes it easy to take it anywhere – beach, poolside, bathroom, great outdoors – with you. Battery life is just as impressive. A single charge gets you around 24 hours of playback, making the Beats Pill more than capable of keeping the party going all night and into the next day. It can even serve as a handy power bank when needed, as you can use it to charge your phone or other devices via USB-C cable.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking to enjoy their favorite tracks to the fullest on the go.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/"> It typically retails for $150, which isn’t bad considering all the features the Beats Pill packs, but you can treat yourself to one for just $100 today.</a> The discount is expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’ve known for a little under a year now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713"><span>Lego and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>were collaborating</span></a><span> on sets featuring Pikachu and friends, and now we finally know what they are, how much they cost, and my god, how do y’all afford this as a regular hobby? They look incredible, though.</span></p> <p><span>The first five </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Lego sets include models for <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152">Pikachu</a>, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/eevee-72151">Eevee</a>, a Pokémon Center, all eight Kanto gym badges, and a huge set featuring <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153">Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise</a>, and will launch on February 27, aka Pokémon Day, commemorating the series’ 30th anniversary.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658897" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658897"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658897">© The Pokémon Company / Lego</figcaption></figure> <p>For anyone who collects official Lego sets, these prices might not deliver much sticker shock. I’m super tempted by the one of Pikachu jumping out of a Poké Ball, but oof dah, $200 is a lot. The Eevee one is the most affordable here, running $59.99, and it’s also the most straightforward model. It’s just Eevee being a little brick guy. However, the Kanto starter trio is a staggering $649.99, which isn’t too surprising when you consider how elaborate it is. It has 6838 pieces, each of which helps build Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise in their natural habitats. The standout is Charizard, who is the centerpiece of the set as it flies off what looks like a volcano. The whole thing’s pretty neat, but is it “more expensive than a PlayStation 5” neat? You decide.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, you won’t find the Pokémon Center and Kanto Badge sets on store shelves. The badges are only available if you buy the starter trio set from February 27 to March 8, and the Pokémon Center is a Lego Insiders reward, available to you if you have 2600 points through your membership.</p>

  <p>Aiming this product line squarely at adults with nostalgia for the brand, The Pokémon Company also released a live-action promo telling folks that Legos are for older Pokémon fans who have bills to pay and lower back pain. I guess kids are also unlikely to have the $650 lying around to pick up the most elaborate of these sets.</p>

<p>The Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise LEGO set is the biggest of them all, featuring the final evolutions of all the Kanto region starter Pokémon.

The only way to get your hands on the LEGO Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection set is by receiving it as a gift with purchase when buying the LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set. The offer is only available between February 27 and March 8, 2026. </p>

<h3 id="h-mini-pokemon-center">Mini Pokémon Center</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the Mini Pokémon Center, the best place to give all your Pokémon a good rest after a strenuous battle. It is a mini-replica of the Pokémon Center that also features a place to rest small Poké Balls. Similar to the Kanto Region Badge Collection, the LEGO Pokémon Mini Pokémon Center can’t be purchased conventionally; it is reserved for LEGO Insiders members and can be bought for 2,500 Insider Points while stocks last.</p>

<p>Again, Eevee's model features a hidden Easter egg, which Lego says highlights the Pokémon's "many evolutions".</p>

<figure data-uuid="27deebf30322b"><a title="Persona 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27deebf30322b/persona-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/persona_5">Persona 5</a> originally released in Japan in September 2016, which means it's been nearly a <em>decade</em> since the latest mainline entry first hit shelves. Fans are exceptionally eager to see what <strong>'Persona 6'</strong> might look like, and according to a brief tease from the franchise's <a href="https://asia.sega.com/p30th/en/">30th anniversary website</a>, we might not be waiting too much longer to get our first glimpse.</p>
<p>As covered by our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/persona-anniversary-site-mentions-next-chapter-for-the-series">Push Square</a>, the Google link to the 30th Anniversary website includes a short snippet of information that reads: "Come celebrate the journey as we usher in the next chapter for the series."</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that this could be referring to the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> which, at the time of writing, has not yet been confirmed for the Switch 2. That seems a little odd though, right? To us, "the next chapter" is more likely a reference to the inevitable brand-new game which, unless something drastic happens, is likely to be called Persona 6.</p>
<p>But still, we're not going to get <em>too</em> excited for the time being. It's a really small piece of information and we think it would be a remarkable coincidence if a Google description was our first official indication of Persona 6.</p>
<p>Atlus will no doubt have much more to say as we work our way through 2026, so we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Icarus </em>creator Dean Hall has revealed that his game, which was released four years ago, received a huge sales boost from the recent Steam Winter Sale, and for that matter, so did its DLC.</p><p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">X</a>, Hall revealed earlier today that <em>Icarus </em>clocked up just shy of a million base game sales during the Steam sale, and that RocketWerkz also managed to sell just under a quarter of a million "DLC units".</p><p>As a quick reminder, <em>Icarus </em>was on offer at a pretty hefty discount during the sale; while the game would usually set you back $35 (as, indeed, it would if you picked it up now), buying it during the Steam winter sale would have cost you just $3.50.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Icarus </em>racked up a pretty healthy sales total during the Steam winter sale.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are several DLC packs available for <em>Icarus</em>, including three major expansions and a number of smaller additions to the game. Hall doesn't break down which of the packs were most popular during the sale, unfortunately.</p><p>Still, given the fact that <em>Icarus </em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-release-date-takes-flight-this-december" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3f90dad-acfd-4ecf-81f3-78c72b65f1bb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">entering its fifth year</a>, getting a million-sale boost, however deep the discount may be, is a pretty impressive feat. There's clearly still an appetite for Hall's particular brand of session-based survival.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's a survival game that shares some of its DNA with extraction shooters. You can either choose to take on timed missions to complete objectives under pressure or simply explore <em>Icarus</em>' hostile terraformed environment at your own pace.</p><p><em>Icarus</em>' popularity has almost certainly been aided by the pedigree of its creator; Dean Hall is also one of the people responsible for perennially popular zombie survival game <em>DayZ</em>, so his name lends gravitas and credence to this title as well.</p>
<p>Right now, <em>Icarus </em>is only available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>, but it's coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this year as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>A poster advertising a definitive edition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy’s The Division</a> appears to have been spotted by folks attending a Ubisoft-run eSports event in Japan. At least, that's assuming this isn't some elaborate ruse designed to draw in spies from other game studios, while only Jack Ryan can see what's truly going on.</p>

<p>Snaps of the poster from attendees of <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5JKjM9XlbV6Lyd2xNYzkIf/apac-cup-at-fps-day-details">FPS Day</a> - an event in Tokyo currently hosting grand final of Rainbow Six 6 Siege's APAC cup - began to pop up over the weekend.

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-poster-for-the-division-definitive-edition-has-reportedly-appeared-at-a-ubisoft-event-in-japan/">VGC</a>, the event's set to host 10th anniversary panel for The Division today. I've reached out to Ubisoft in case the company fancy providing definitive proof of this definitive edition prior to any definitive announcements they might have planned.</p>
<p>Since The Division's release in 2016, it's been followed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-2-review">a sequel</a>, with The Division 3 having been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced back in 2023</a> but had gone pretty quiet until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-gearing-up-to-be-a-monster-says-series-executive-producer/1100-6537293/">fairly recently</a>.</p>
<p>Brendy (RPS in peace) expressed an appreciation for The Division in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-pc-review">near decade old review</a>, despite the shooter having plenty of hangups and annoyances which could get on your wick:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reading this, you might think I have mixed feelings. Really, I have mostly-good feelings. I have all the same problems with The Division as I had with its closest bedmate, Destiny. The transparency of its bit-by-bit progression system, the gating of areas by level, the sponginess of its enemies, its reliance on scrubbing the map clean of icons, all designed to make you grind first and think later. And yet I enjoy it a lot more than the latter.</p>
<p>I think this is all down to the setting and the fine detail of the streets. In Destiny, you get Peter Dinklage nattering on about "the light" and "the darkness" and any other fantasy sci-fi cliché you can pull out of your cryo tube. In The Division you get enemies with motives, a world with a reason for being the way it is, and bosses with some semblance of character. I'm not saying there are no clichés (a virus has run amok). It's just that they are of a much higher quality.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll have to see if this a case of loose lips sinking the secretness of a Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine-level repackaging of a near ten year old shooter, or some sort of goof.</p>

            <guid>1403398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A quick word-association exercise will usually produce the word “Bose” when the question is “luxury headphones.” In terms of performance and especially active noise cancellation, that’s absolutely true. But in terms of price, even Bose’s newest models are more accessible than you might think, and never more accessible than right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">thanks to this $50-off Amazon deal on the QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones</a>.</p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="1017">The QC Ultra 2s dropped just this past October at $450, but lately Amazon and other retailers have quietly slashed the price deep into deal hunter territory. That means this $400 Amazon deal represents savings on months-old Bose headphones that would make even the most hardened tech shopper blink and the most devoted audiophile reach for their wallet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="690" data-end="1017">Serious Sound, Serious Deal</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Here’s the wild part: Despite its premium positioning and outstanding , this deal pushes the QC Ultra 2s <em data-start="1101" data-end="1108">below</em> the cost of some older Bose QuietComfort models (yeah, the ones that aren’t even “Ultra”). So if you were on the fence about spending bigger on flagship-level noise cancellation, this Amazon deal makes the argument a whole lot easier.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose took their stellar original QuietComfort Ultra headphones and made several significant upgrades to create the QuietComfort Ultra 2s. This latest model delivers Bose’s very best adaptive noise cancellation performance, with AI-based background noise suppression and Wind Block tech for listening in windy conditions. Bose added two new sound modes – Immersion and Cinema — along with support for wired lossless listening via audio or USB-C cables. The Cinema mode is a high-performing spatial setting which balances the overall audio in favor of dialogue, ideal for streaming and podcasts.</p>


<h2 data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Truly Premium</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Even the physical look of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 headphones is a step up from the originals, with more premium materials, polished metal yokes, and an overall sleeker and more modern look. The over-ear comfort level of the Ultra 2s is a step up from the already-pleasing original Ultras, and the battery life has been upgraded from 24 hours to 30. But it’s the active noise cancellation that Bose really leans into, and if you’re still recovering from holiday travel that involved overcrowded planes or trains stuffed with noisy commuters, you know the real value of a pair of world-class noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones pair easily with any Bluetooth device — Apple, Google, Android, and any properly equipped smart TV, for starters — and the Bluetooth Core 5.4 connection is strong and steady. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">This somewhat unexpected Amazon sale bringing the QC Ultra 2 headphones down to $400 so soon after their release is the best way for you to experience true Bose sound without breaking the bank.</a></p>
