            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-strong-debut-in-the-united-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut week's physical sales data from the United Kingdom</a>, we now have more estimates suggesting that Ghost of Yōtei was very successful for developer Sucker Punch Productions and publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>



<p>Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has shared</a> that the game has already surpassed 1.6 million units sold to customers to date (over two million units if we consider copies already sold to retailers). This is just slightly slower than its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 2.4 million units in the first three days and became the fastest-selling Sony-published new intellectual property released for the PlayStation 4</a>.</p>



<p>As previously noted, though, Ghost of Tsushima launched on July 17, 2020, when most of the world still had stay-at-home restrictions that effectively turned into a considerable incentive to play games. During that time, the gaming industry reached new revenue heights due to the abnormally high amount of time people were able to dedicate to games.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the game debuted at the very end of the PS4's lifecycle, when the console had sold 110 million units globally, whereas the PS5 has just reached 80 million units sold as of this August. In this perspective, Ghost of Yōtei is performing admirably, even more so when you consider other factors, such as the fact that the budget was reportedly the same as the previous installment (around $60 million) and that it is currently outperforming all major PS5 releases, including Assassin's Creed Shadows, since Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, over 93% of those who played Ghost of Tsushima returned for the new game. They certainly didn't go wrong, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I explained in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>



<p>The latest Alinea Analytics newsletter also reveals that Battlefield 6 is poised to launch to great numbers tomorrow, with 1.8 million pre-orders on Steam alone and 3.5 million wishlists on Valve's platform. While you wait to play the game yourself, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go read Wccftech's review written by David Carcasole</a>.</p>

Buying a microSD Express card gives you more storage, though at a higher cost than most people likely want to pay. However, <strong>Lexar’s 512GB and 1TB microSD Express cards</strong> are currently selling at the lowest prices we’ve seen yet.</p><p>The 512GB model is $88.47 ($31 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSD-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0512G-BNNNU/dp/B0DYBW1MNC/ref=sr_1_4?crid=33EQD1TTA66MB&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.k1QsShijZU0-0nNMo-n2hLQ_J6pTr9Jpyf3IlLGlAZlpcy0aX4a6ak7w2zE2isABp58PsOJNeazBF1CJQvvkvgFX1dyFYWBxcxLi6Cii4dacv1B5sTUO4M0fvhA2mVVFAtd58ShjVODJX8juvg-JcXqZJ7DXsmNysy_GIowJhfWWN553kGvI-d-qEtKri_HdnmuslOHiVzXH8cd_eExRUKXkKwtPei_FCWPDjnvYLZY.T6y59F5XDrKNdsUJ6R8sxCwl7pEpSb4cEAcRscsVL1k&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=lexar%2Bmicrosd%2Bcard&amp;qid=1760024724&amp;sprefix=lexar%2Bmicrosd%2Bcard%2Caps%2C211&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, or double the extra storage to 1TB for $157.96 ($62 off), also at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSD-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.

In general, these are the best prices we’ve seen yet on this pricey storage.</p><p>The number of games you can install to a microSD Express card depends on the size of the card you buy, of course, as well as on the games in your library. For example, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fdonkey-kong-bananza-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> requires just 8.9GB, while <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fcyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Editio</em></a><em>n </em>eats up 60.6GB. Regardless, having extra space for digital games will likely be necessary at some point, even if it’s not right now.</p><p>Here’s another reason why you should consider buying one, especially while they’re cheaper: several publishers are opting for Nintendo’s Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641853/nintendo-describes-switch-2-game-key-cards">Game-Key cards</a>, which look like cartridges, but are effectively keys that unlock a download and authenticate your system to play it. So, even if you’re buying a physical cartridge of a new game, you may need to rely on the extra storage space afforded by a microSD Express card to let you play it.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797782/lexar-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A sequel to A Minecraft Movie is officially in the works, complete with a June 2027 release.</p>



<p>The worldwide sensation Minecraft has kept players occupied with its world-building fun since 2011. Millions of fans have purchased the game, and it has become a household name since. This year, Warner Bros. released a movie adaptation of the game, called A Minecraft Movie. Needless to say, it is currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a>. Now, after months of speculation, it seems we’ll be returning to the mines real soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-sequel-releasing-on-june-27th-2027-director-returning">A Minecraft Movie Sequel Releasing on June 27th, 2027, Director Returning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie/status/1976341544266498142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> post, it was announced that A Minecraft Movie sequel is officially in the works. It’s unknown what the sequel will be named. Furthermore, the original director, Jared Hess, will return to do the second one. With a poster showing two shiny pickaxes, we also have a release date: June 27th, 2027. The date does place it with to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-simpsons-movie-coming-after-almost-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Movie 2</a>, so it’s sure to be a big day for the box office.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s unknown if any of the original cast will return for the sequel. Even more so, we don’t know about the plot, as it’s being kept under wraps for now. Despite that, the movie is sure to be just as popular, especially since it knows what worked. Countless memes like “Chicken Jockey” and “I am Steve” flooded the internet even before its release and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even caused uproars</a> in theaters. Warner Bros. is aware of it and honed in on it for marketing, which likely caused its box-office soar. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares out and if it’ll keep the charm many fans enjoyed.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/rubiks-cube-reimagined-as-a-multi-game-multi-screened-gadget-for-299/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rubik%E2%80%99s-cube-gets-a-299-update-complete-with-ips-screens-and-its-own-apps.1321243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The Rubik’s Cube has been reinvented with more games and many more screens for much more money.</p>
<p>What has long been cherished as a simple toy yet complex puzzle requiring nothing but a healthy amount of twisting, turning, and patience has been rebooted for the 21st century. Naturally, that calls for a few dashes of technology.</p>
<p>Differing from the original Rubik’s Cube, which has six faces that each contain a 3×3 grid, the Rubik’s WOWCube, made available for preorder today, as spotted by<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797601/spin-master-rubiks-cube-wowcube-puzzle-app-store-mobile-games"> The Verge</a>, has six faces with 2×2 grids.</p>


<p>Rather than a solid-colored sticker, each of the toy's 24 squares is a 240×240 IPS display. The cube itself is composed of eight "cubicle modules," as Cubios, the company behind the toy, calls them. Each module includes three of those IPS screens and a dedicated SoC. As a Cubios <a href="https://wowcube.com/support/">support page</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our patented magnetic connectors allow the modules to maintain perfect electrical contact and seamless data flow between them, no matter how the cube is rotated. This ensures that data can be transferred between autonomous modules on the fly, enabling data sharing and distributing low voltage power across the WOWCube …</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of the 24 displays can be set to show a solid color for solving a simpler, but still captivating, Rubik’s puzzle. Alternatively, the screens can be twisted and turned to play dozens of different games, including <em>Block Buster</em>,<em> Space Invaders</em>, and <em>Jewel Hunter.</em></p>

<p>Also part of the toy is a gyroscope, 6-axis accelerometer, and eight speakers. Cubios claims the integrated battery can last for up to seven hours before needing a recharge.</p>
<p>In order to add games or other apps to the WOWCube, you must download the WOWCube Connect iOS or Android app, pair the toy with your phone over Bluetooth, and then use the mobile app to download games onto the WOWCube.</p>
<p>Currently, the WOWCube’s online app store <a href="https://wowcube.com/store/category/all-games">lists 47 games</a>; some cost money to download, and some aren’t available yet. The WOWCube runs its own operating system, dubbed CubiOS, and Cubios (the company) offers a <a href="https://wowcube.com/devkit/">free DevKit</a>.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-float-feat-jim-adkins-by-jay-som">Patrick Recommends: "Float (feat: Jim Adkins)" by Jay Som</h3><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8zILRiE5wk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jay Som - Float [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]"></iframe></figure><p>If video games were my primary interest in elementary school and middle school, music was my primary interest in high school. Some of that was writing about video games transitioning from a curiosity to a legitimate career trajectory, but I also happened to grow up at such a cool fucking time for technology. Napster, the iPod, CD-Rs—<em>all</em> of that was happening while I was in high school. Oh, and street teams. It was the era of the street time, the time when you were sent a box full of tapes and tiny posters you were supposed to put on people's windshields in the parking lot. I promise it was sick as hell.</p><p>My high school era cemented so much of the music that I still listen to now. I do listen to new music, but it often goes in one ear and out the other. Not much sticks. When I don't know what to listen to, I'll randomly pick a band I like (i.e. Flaming Lips) and ask Apple Music to make a radio station out of it. The result is something very pleasant while answering emails or writing an article like this, but it rarely results in me going "holy shit, who <em>is</em> this artist?"</p><p>So when something <em>does</em> stick, it feels notable. I only discovered Jay Som's single for an upcoming album in a message board thread, because I looked at the "feat: Jim Adkins" part and went "huh, why is that familiar." Oh, right: Jimmy Eat World. I was eating up anything Weezer-adjacent around high school, too, and while many of those bands are lost to time, Jimmy Eat World was one of the really good ones. The Middle remains one of my favorite albums. </p><p>Float would be an excellent track without Jim on it. It's a <em>transendent</em> track with Jim's vocals on it. Plus, the music video is such a throwback, too. High school and early college was the time of house parties. Do people still do house parties, where you'd wander around the entirety of a house half drunk and have a million different conversations that you won't remember the next day? That stuff ruled.</p><p>Also, I highly recommend playing this very, very loud in a car.</p><p>FLOAT DON'T FLYYYYYY FLOAT DON'T FLYYYYYY</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-stick-apple-tv">Rob Recommends: <em>Stick</em>, Apple TV+  </h3><figure><figcaption><span>You should also watch Shrinking on Apple TV!</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love sports movies but one of my favorite movies is <em>Tin Cup, </em>a Kevin Costner romantic comedy where he’s a burned-out never-was golfer who falls in love with his golf nemesis’ girlfriend. I turns out I might be a sucker for ”washed-up middle-aged golfer” stories because I’ve really enjoyed <em>Stick</em>, an Owen Wilson dramedy on Apple where he plays a man who crashed-out of the pro tour due to personal tragedy and who crashed out of the rest of his adult life due to his inability to process or handle any of the ensuing fallout. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> is winding down its 18th season this week, with its 19th set to begin on October 14. The season doubles as both a return of the hero shooter’s previous Halloween events, and a chance to shake things up with new modes, tweaks, and some rarer rewards than seasons past. While breaking down all that’s coming in season 19, Blizzard also teased something coming in season 20: hero 45.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard’s full developer update breaks down several changes and additions happening in season 19. The Halloween event this year is called Haunted Masquerade, and it lets you put on masks based on different heroes that grant you different perks. Some of these buffs are simple, such as Tracer’s mask granting you increased movement speed and Junkrat’s making your enemies explode when they die. Other hidden perks are found when you pair some masks with specific heroes. If you’re playing as Brigitte, for example, wearing the Reinhardt mask will make your shield as large as his. It also looks like a Mei mask might add a Blizzard effect to Juno’s Ultimate, allowing you to freeze enemies in a straight path. So it looks like a lot of interesting, unexpected combos await.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the Stadium side of things, Torbjörn, Sojourn, and Hazard are being added to the build-centric mode, and some of their upgrades look pretty nasty. Torb can create multiple upgradable turrets to place around the field, Sojourn can get a Soldier: 76-style auto-aim when she ults, and Hazard can now shoot bursts from the spikes on his back. Those are just a few examples of how their play styles will no doubt change as you upgrade and tweak your build throughout Stadium’s long matches. Ana has been in the mode for a while, but she is also getting a rework to change up some of her loadouts. All characters are also getting consumable gadgets that they can use throughout the match that will grant you temporary buffs. One example shown in the video is an item that makes your hero grow in size with increased damage and defense.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Mythic Skins, the customizable prestige skins released each season, have been a bit hit-or-miss since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lifeweaver-overwatch-2-pansexual-season-4-support-hero-1850294521"><span>Lifeweaver’s</span></a><span> Divine Druid Mythic skin is really fucking gorgeous. Blizzard is retooling the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prisms-battle-pass-mercy-1851414356"><span>Mythic upgrade levels</span></a><span> so you’ll unlock more significant alterations more quickly, but that’s not the only major change happening this season. In season 19, Blizzard will release two mythic skins, rather than just one. The second one will be for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-skin-contest-china-junkrat-furry-diaper-2000630263"><span>Junkrat</span></a><span> and will be available in the mid-season patch. We didn’t see it, but Blizzard says it’s called “Cyberfuel.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Closing out the presentation, Blizzard revealed it is finally putting all of the external lore media, such as comics and animated shorts, in the game itself. So now those of you who only really interact with </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> through the game itself will be able to read and watch these in your launcher. Everything we can glimpse in this new section of the main menu during the presentation is recent material from </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, so it’s unclear just how far back in the lore we’ll be going here. Will this be a one-stop shop for works dating back to the original game? We’ll see next week. After talking about the past, Blizzard also teased the future with hero 45. The sword-wielding damage hero will be getting a trial session at some point during season 19, but all we saw of her was a silhouette and a brief shot of her legs as she shouts, “Ready yourselves for war!”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This mystery swordswoman was briefly teased in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><span>latest motion comic</span></a><span> starring Ramattra and Zenyatta, where she was seen standing in front of an explosion with her giant sword. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t have enough melee-centric heroes, so hopefully she spices things up when she joins the roster in season 20.</span></p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest edition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnitemares-2025-all-skins-weapons-and-new-map/2900-7125/" data-ref-id="2900-7125">Fortnitemares</a> includes horror icons like Jason, Ghostface, the Scooby Gang, and Doja Cat. The only nonfictional character on that list has already made some waves across social media--or at least the Fortnite X account that was supposedly being run by her.</p><p>Doja Cat was scheduled to take over the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite X account</a> on Wednesday before the release of the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnitemares-2025-a-terrifying-new-cast-of-horror-icons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnitemares announcement</a>, but she says it wasn’t actually her after the account posted a message about "rose toys" that some assume was referencing sex toys.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-cheapest-way-to-buy-the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-biggest-holiday-games.1321195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Switch game vouchers. Discounted eShop gift cards. Those are the keys to getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-release-date-motorcycle-open-world-2000625308"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> for the cheapest possible price at launch. You think Nintendo does Black Friday deals for new games? In this economy?! Nope!!!</p> <p>You’re probably already familiar <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-game-voucher-discount-save-deal-cheap-1851684045">with this discount method</a>. You wait until Newegg or some other virtual currency reseller <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004">has a deal</a> on Nintendo eShop gift cards. Usually it’s $5 off of $50. You can then add that currency to your digital wallet and use it to buy Switch game vouchers which act as free coupons to redeem full-price games. You get a pair for $100 and use them to buy two $60 games. In this case, that’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, out October 16,&nbsp;and <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, out December 4. You save $30. It’s effectively buy one, get one 50 percent off.</p>

 <p>But you’re thinking, “Wait, I have a Switch 2 now. I want the Switch 2 versions of those games.” The same deal applies. You just have to pay for the $10 Switch 2 upgrades separately. You end up shelling out $110 instead of $140 (the Switch 2 versions are normally $70). It’s still $30 off the combined total but more of a buy one, get one 40 percent off deal. So it goes with Nintendo.</p>

 <p>The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969">announced earlier this year</a> that it’s killing off game vouchers going forward, but fans still have until January 30, 2026 to purchase them and use them on current Switch games. After that date, Nintendo will stop selling the game vouchers, but you’ll have an additional 12 months to redeem any existing ones before they expire. Maybe Nintendo will introduce a revised version of the program for Switch 2 once we’ve fully transitioned over.</p> <p>In the meantime, it’s your best bet for a more affordable double-feature this holiday, at least if you don’t mind owning the games digitally. Which I know some of your do. At least neither of their physical versions are game key cards, even if they do fall victim to the ugly new Switch 2 box art labels.</p>

<p>One of VR’s biggest music games is launching an all-new entry, Synth Riders: Overdrive, on the Nintendo Switch later this year.</p>



<p>The music action genre is one not explored as much as it should be. Games like Rhythm Heaven, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-aaron-greenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and the upcoming Unbeatable bring the beats and fun, but the genre still unexplored. However, the VR space, led by Beat Saber, has been a beacon of groovy gameplay and entertainment. One such game was 2019’s Synth Riders, which has launched on multiple VR platforms like Oculus Rift and PSVR. The game mixes Tron-like cyberpunk visuals with music-based gameplay featuring today’s biggest songs. Its success with fans and critics left its mark on them and, now, the acclaimed series is returning, this time for the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-synth-riders-overdrive-brings-the-beats-to-nintendo-switch">Synth Riders: Overdrive Brings The Beats To Nintendo Switch </h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Announced today with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfeXfq44AiM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new trailer</a>, developer Kluge Interactive revealed that Synth Riders: Overdrive, a new game in the series, is coming to the Nintendo Switch. Made from the ground up, the title brings the music-filled gameplay to newer audiences, along with the addition of multiplayer and story mode. With three difficulty modes, you can play through dozens of pop songs from artists like Charli XCX, Jack Harlow, Starcadian, and more. In a statement from Kluge, founder and CEO Arturo Perez said the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As experts in music rhythm games who’ve created a successful VR immersive experience, we’re excited to bring our expertise and passion for music to Nintendo Switch gamers with Synth Riders: Overdrive,” states Perez. “The Switch’s portability and local multiplayer capabilities make it the perfect platform for friends and families to experience this fast-paced musical adventure together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Synth Riders: Overdrive plans to release before the end of 2025, with DLC already in the works featuring Gorillaz and Monster Cat. More information can be found on <a href="http://synthriders.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s official website</a>, as well as on social media.</p>

It comes with a buildable stand, a regular and a gold Batman minifigure, plus a gold coin celebrating 20 years of Batman LEGO sets.</p></div><p id="batman-v-superman-batmobile"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Batman v Superman Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h2></p><div catalogid="b7aa58a6-51ca-4d7b-900d-fcddcb0f0df5" id="229381"><div id="229381" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From the universally beloved 2016 movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice">Batman v Superman</a> comes this sleek, gray, angular take on the Batmobile.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eco-focused-nonprofit-releases-standard-to-make-games-%E2%80%98the-most-sustainable-form-of-entertainment%E2%80%99.1321180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, The Sustainable Games Alliance, a nonprofit made up of games industry professionals and environmental researchers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sustainable-games-alliance_today-were-proud-to-announce-the-launch-activity-7381260693489999872-pgQP/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> a framework that any developer or studio can apply to make their games more sustainable. The <a href="https://sustainablegamesalliance.org/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sustainable Games Standard</a>, as it’s known, is the product of a year of work and collaboration with game companies and scientists. The goal? To make games “the most sustainable form of entertainment.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a lofty one for sure, especially considering that at this point the games industry has proven <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-companies-vow-action-on-climate-change-but-1838420425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inconsistent</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/climate-goals-targets-video-game-companies-carbon-1849810896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at best</a> when it comes to environmental matters. But the goal is to make the standard as accessible as possible so that a significantly greater number of companies can get on the same page. This, according to the Sustainable Games Alliance, will allow companies to “track emissions accurately within the game lifecycle, identify cost-saving, impact-reducing opportunities, comply with new global regulations, optimize energy use and battery life, reduce hardware load while improving performance, enhance player experience while lowering environmental impact.”</p><p>The standard, research lead <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/10/07/afterclimate-video-games-climate-change-ubisoft-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Abraham</a> told Aftermath, necessitated some creative thinking to meet the unique needs of game developers.</p><p>“In terms of methodology, each one is a little bit different,” said Abraham. “I started with whatever already existed, talked to a lot of our member companies and some other contributing ones. We knew we needed a quick and dirty method for as many as possible, so where there's the option to make a ‘spend based’ calculation, we've put one in there. Those are good for fast and easy numbers, but they don't give you any control over the emissions, because the only way to reduce them is ‘spend less money,’ which you might not want to do if you're marketing your new game.”</p><p>This meant that in some cases, Abraham – alongside games industry experts – had to devise new methods entirely.</p><p>“Like the [section 3.11] use of sold products (mobile) component, which says ‘OK, phones have batteries, what if we measure the battery level at the start and the end of a game session, that will tell us how much power the game has used,’” said Abraham. “Because the use of energy at the battery doesn't actually directly generate emissions, we also have to trace it back to the source, which is grid electricity emissions. To get power from the grid there has to be a charger that converts AC to DC, and when you do that you get power losses, so you also need to account for that by adding some extra on top for charger losses.”</p><p>The Sustainable Games Alliance says that 30+ companies are already among its ranks – with standouts including Remedy, Starbreeze, and Colossal Order – and Abraham believes that more will inevitably jump on board now that the standard is out in the wild.</p><p>“It's so easy to join the SGA," said Abraham. "Companies literally only need to send an email and say ‘We want to join,’ and the board considers and approves their application. … We've been talking to several big games companies for a very long time, and a lot of them are on board with the goals of the SGA and the standard; they have just needed a big public reason to join. It's also a hard time to get any spending approved in the games industry, so we get it. It just takes time. I'm confident that we're demonstrating the value of what we're doing.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah"><h3>Chess Dungeon Crawler, Yeah</h3></a><p>Below the Crown combines roguelike hallmarks with chess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be “the first of its kind” to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/sustainable-games-alliance-standard-sustainable-environment-climate]]></content:encoded>

<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stylish Street Skating Adventure -</strong> Skate through nine layers of the Underworld. Journey through streets and surreal landscapes full of waxed ledges, unholy gaps and tortured demons.</p>
<p><strong>Succumb to the Beauty of the Board -</strong> Sell your soul for decks, wheels and trucks to keep your skating fresh. Over 70+ skate tricks to progress and improve. Complete skate trials to level up and get new gear.</p>

Here’s another one that could be a “like it now, love it later” buy, looking ahead to when the warm weather returns: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speaker, with IPX7 waterproofing to go along with its great sound, just had its price cut in half to just $40.</a></p>
<p>The Soundcore Motion 100’s waterproofing, compact size, and handy built-in loop for carrying or hanging make it a perfect shower speaker for when the pool and beach parties aren’t an option, and when the great outdoor are calling you back, it’s ideal for looping onto bike handlebars, hanging from a backpack or a canopy with a carabiner, or just carrying since it only weighs 1.3 pounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Little Speaker, Big Sound</h2>
<p>A speaker this small shouldn’t sound this big or this good, but that’s the Soundcore Motion 100’s calling card. It brings quality, detailed sound at up to 40kHz, with the option to hit the BassUp button to get that deep chest-thumping bass going. It’s app-controlled, with a detailed 9-band EQ control that gives you the power of in-depth customization.</p>
<p>That sound is driven by dual full-range drivers, with a bold 20W output with or without the extra bass. The total effect vastly outpunches the modest size of the speaker — barely over 7 inches long by 2.5 inches wide by 2 inches tall. As a shower speaker or compact yet powerful home speaker living on a shelf, it more than does the job. As a source of quality music on the go, it’s among the best.</p>



<h2>Why Stop at Just One?</h2>
<p>The Motion 100 can also be paired with another Motion 100 to create a surround-sound experience. When one Motion 100 is just $30, why stop there? A quality portable surround sound system for $60 is more than a little tempting. You won’t wear them out, either, since they have a robust 12-hour life on a single USB-C charge.</p>
<p>When a 4.6-star-rated portable Bluetooth speaker is available at Amazon for $60, and it’s IPX7 waterproof so it can be a shower speaker, poolside speaker, and everything in between, it’s worth serious consideration. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">When that very same speaker gets an unexpected 50% price cut and becomes a $40 speaker, it becomes a truly great deal</a>. We’re still leaning toward buying two of the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speakers to get that surround sound going, but there is going to be at least one in our Amazon shopping cart imminently.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it’s adding two classic Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games to the Xbox Game Pass library. </p>



<p>Starting today, October 9, both Heroes of Might and Magic II: Gold and Heroes of Might and Magic III: Complete are available for all members on the platform. The games will be available on PC for PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>“I can think of no better way to teach a new generation the meaning of key words like throng, necromancy, and logistics,” Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2kNoEMd70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Watters said</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to the games being added to the service, it was also revealed that Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being pushed to 2026</a>. To fill in the gap between now and the launch, however, developers Unfrozen have released a demo on PC via Steam.</p>

                <p>The new patch notes are in for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/news/">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-update-buffs-vault-hunters/1100-6535180/" data-ref-id="1100-6535180">and like several other updates</a>, this new round of tweaks to the game is focused on empowering players--specifically, their arsenal of weapons. Gearbox says that it's focusing on smaller gear adjustments, starting with several Legendary-class weapons. These hard-to-find weapons haven't felt as good to use in combat despite having unique perks, so their overall power is getting dialed up substantially.</p><p>One prime example here is the Hellwalker, a Jacobs fire-and-forget shotgun that was introduced in Borderlands 3 and is almost a carbon copy of the Super-Shotgun used by the Doom Slayer in Id's Doom games. This will now do 30% extra base damage, so if you have a Jakobs mod equipped and the right skills activated, it should shred through rank-and-file enemies with ease. Queen's Rest, a pistol manufactured by Torgue, will also start firing rounds faster, as this has been increased by 50%, while the chance for its unique perk to spawn a homing sticky projectile has been increased from 30% to 50%.</p>

      </div>
<p>Other notable changes include damage and fire-rate increases to Ruby's Grasp, the drone deployed from Bully will do 50% more damage, and Convergence base damage has been increased by 25%. If you don't have one of these Legendary-class weapons yet, they can be farmed from bosses found throughout Kairos, or you might want to check Mauricie's Black Market vending machine to see if he has it in stock.</p><p>Maurice offers unique Legendary gear for any player who accesses his machine, so if RNG is on your side, you might be able to purchase one of these upgraded guns with a very desirable roll of stats. You can also take a chance with the Golden Treasure Chests, as these often hand out Legendaries when you open them. To stock up on Golden Keys, check our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">Borderlands 4 Shift Code guide</a> for updates.</p><p>Gearbox has also made a few other changes, like ensuring that the legendary Tediore shotgun Anarchy properly rewards stacks of Mutualism after auto-reloading or killing enemies, and Vex's Bleed skill will now count as status effect damage. You can see the full patch notes below, and next week, Gearbox will upload a patch that focuses on fine-tuning Class Mods, Repkits, Shields, and Firmware. Borderlands 4 has also struggled with performance issues since launch, but Gearbox says next week's update will address these issues and add some highly requested quality-of-life changes.</p><h2>Borderlands 4 Update Notes</h2><h4>Weekly Activities</h4><ul><li><b>Weekly Big Encore Boss</b> switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those who take it on.</li><li>The<b> Weekly Wildcard Mission</b> changed.

<hr>
<p>The hardware side of things is much as you might expect, though there's been a slight uptick in PS5 sales — hey, all those copies of Ghost of Yotei have to be played somewhere. The Switch 2 remains out front with 44,439 sales this week, followed by the standard PS5 and the Switch OLED.</p>
<p>Combining the three Switch 1 SKUs pulls in a total of 24,109 units sold this week, while the three PS5 models rack up 27,344. A win for Sony!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Discord Hack Sounds Really, Really Bad]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I got a strange <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-sdk-nitro-ads-ipo-profitable-splitgate-2-1851770484">email from Discord</a> last Friday at the very end of the work day informing me of “a recent security incident on September 20 involving your personal data.” It said personal info related to my account had been compromised, but not full credit card info or my personal address. The email made it seem like only a small number of people were impacted and simply told me to “stay alert” about any suspicious emails I might get. Suspicious? On the internet? In 2025? Good luck! Nearly a week late it’s becoming clear that this “limited access” hack of a “third-party customer service system used by Discord” is a much bigger deal than it originally seemed.</p> <p>“A small number of government‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport) from users who had appealed an age determination” were included in the leak, Discord informed users like me last week. According to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-discord-hack-is-every-users-worst-nightmare/">new report by <em>404 Media</em></a>, the hackers responsible gloated in a Telegram group that they actually had 1.5TB of users’ personal data. Discord admitted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797051/discord-government-ids-leaked-data-breach?ref=404media.co"><em>The Verge</em></a> last night that it actually believes up to 70,000 users may have had their government IDs breached. There’s already a <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/2397306/discord-sued-after-user-info-leaked-in-breach-of-vendor">class-action lawsuit</a> being filed in California.</p>

 <p>One of the big culprits in this entire mess is legislation like the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act which requires users to prove to platforms that they’re 18 years or older using selfies and government IDs. In the era of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals">a $1 trillion generative AI deal-industrial complex</a>, that feels like potentially putting your entire identity up for grabs on the internet. “Online ID checks may seem like a common-sense solution, but that facade hides a much darker truth: lawmakers are pressuring companies to implement surveillance and censorship tactics and it’s putting all of us in danger,” <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2025-03-06-new-letter-90-civil-rights-and-privacy-organizations-condemn-id-checking-bills-citing-effectiveness-censorship-and-privacy-concerns/">anti-surveillance campaigner</a> Sarah Philips told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in an email.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chat, we are cooked</p> <p>Discord is being extorted by the people who compromised their Zendesk instance</p> <p>They've got 1.5TB of age verification related photos. 2,185,151 photos</p> <p>tl;dr 2.1m Discord users drivers license and/or passport might be leaked.

The samples reportedly include screengrabs of thumbnails of users’ identification selfies as well as a help desk ticket that seemingly belongs to alleged <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson</a>.</p>

 <p>How did the hackers get this data to begin with? A spokesperson for ZenDesk, the third-party customer service company supporting Discord, told 404 Media its systems were “not compromised.” Infosec account vx-underground <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1976238815665856646?ref=404media.co">was told</a> the breach came via an outsourced support agent.</p>

 <p>“All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts,” Discord spokesperson Nu Wexler told <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week. “We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.”</p> <p>Discord did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims it’s being extorted or the vulnerability that led to the hack.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-demo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-pushed-to-2026-demo-released.1321120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After originally being scheduled for a release in Q2 2025, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access has been pushed to 2026. A specific window for the year wasn’t announced.</p>



<p>As part of Ubisoft’s celebration of the Might &amp; Magic franchise’s 30th anniversary, it was also revealed that the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era demo is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam.</a></p>



<p>First announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom 2024</a>, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the eighth installment of the long-running turn-based strategy game. It’s the first title in the series since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII.</p>



<p>The game features six factions at launch—Temple, Necropolis, Sylvan, Dungeon, Hive, and Schism—as well as several modes, including campaign, random single maps, custom maps, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer with modes like classic, single-hero, and arena. </p>



<p>Online multiplayer, for the first time in series history, will even feature general matchmaking that allows you to quickly jump into a game with other players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the game was first set to launch in Q2 2025, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed in June</a> to “later in 2025”. At the time, Unfrozen said it was done to “ensure we give Olden Era the care it deserves”.</p>



<p><strong>“From the beginning, our goal has been to create something truly special, and that takes time, care, and iteration,”</strong> they said. <strong>“However, as an indie studio, we need a bit more time to get everything ready for the big Early Access release.”</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-blops-7-sbmm-muiltiplayer-matchmaking-2000633695</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) enters the news yet again as <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s devs have fully committed to an about-face on the highly debated practice of matching folks with relative skill levels in online matches with randos. Not only will matches have more variety of skill level across players, but perhaps most excitingly, randomly matched lobbies that vibe well can stick together across multiple games, much like how things used to work in the good old days of <i>Halo 3</i> and other shooters that let people party up and play together in game after game more seamlessly.</p> <p>The news broke <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">via a blog post</a> following the game’s beta (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1976285808446537995">h/t <i>CharlieIntel</i></a><i>)</i>, and it’s music to the ears of many. In theory, grouping up people of similar skill levels in random matches sounds good. In practice, opponents of this approach argue that it leads to sweatier, more competitive matches. Its overuse effectively eliminates a more relaxed playstyle in which every match isn’t just a zero-sum game for aspiring esports competitors to rule the leaderboards.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SBMM war is over… never thought we'd see it <a href="https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv">https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1976296080267719063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>SBMM isn’t being totally thrown out. The dev blog states that there’ll be “minimal skill consideration” for default <i>BLOPS 7</i> games. So hopefully that means we won’t see too many players with a pro-level skillset demolishing folks just looking to unwind after work with a few rounds of <i>COD</i>.</p> <p>I’m skeptical that this pivot will see the debate over SBMM go away. Still, it’s a great opportunity for <i>BLOPS7</i> to serve as a case study for how devs can design matchmaking features that optimize having fun without shutting out the more competitive players amongst us.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The days of the touchscreen laptop living in the premium price slot may be over for good, if this Amazon post-Prime Day deal is any indicator. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">The original $2,999 price tag on this 14-inch HP touchscreen Intel laptop might verge on ridiculous, but the 87%-off deal that drops that number down to just $390 is also ridiculous, but in a good way</a>.</p>
<p>The huge leaps forward made by tablets and their keyboard attachments may have taken eyes off of the touchscreen laptop, but this HP model is proof that a solid everyday laptop with a touchscreen isn’t just a novelty. Students, creatives, and everyday users who just can’t deal with a trackpad will love how easy the touchscreen makes using this laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4672/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid Foundation</h2>
<p>The guts of this HP touchscreen laptop are right at that sweet spot between “more than you’ll ever need or use” and “so puny that I can’t do anything without lagging.” The Intel Celeron N4500 processor (up to 2.8GHz burst frequency) and Intel UHD graphics chip won’t win in a footrace against premium laptops, but they won’t slow you down at all when you get deep into your daily multitasking. They’re backed by 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, so there’s plenty of room for your files, projects, and apps.</p>
<p>Then there’s the touchscreen and all of the possibilities it presents. Pair it with an inexpensive stylus — there are literally dozens of them at Amazon — and you can annotate presentation slides or other documents, or even jot down quick notes or sketches for yourself on the fly. The touchscreen also lets you tap, scroll, and pinch to zoom in like a tablet. Soon you’ll be swiping through pages and menus and browser tabs faster than you ever could with a trackpad or mouse.</p>



<h2>Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>This deal comes with one year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal, which includes all of the premium Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, and also cloud storage and the security of Microsoft Defender. The HP True Vision 720p HD webcam with dual-array mics and HD Audio speakers make this touchscreen laptop a natural for Zoom meetings and other video calls, and two SuperSpeed USB-A ports, an HDMI 1.4b port, and a SD card reader are great expansion options.</p>
<p>We’d be pulling your leg if we told you this was a solid $2,999 laptop. But while it falls short of that impossibly high mark, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">it most definitely overdelivers on the new $390 price tag it’s rocking right now during this post-Prime Day 87%-off deal at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-greed-over-gaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-%E2%80%98greed-over-gaming%E2%80%99.1321081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox founder has recently discussed the Game Pass price hikes, describing them as a betrayal of fans and “greed over gaming”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, at the beginning of October 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Game Pass Ultimate’s price would be raised by 50% and that its tier features would change. The players have definitely not taken this move well, given that Xbox console prices <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-revenue-growth-microsoft-is-raising-xbox-console-prices-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were increased just last month</a>. Now, the Xbox founder has shared their views on the Game Pass price hikes. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-price-hikes-are-shattering-the-brand-and-alienating-loyal-fans">Game Pass Price Hikes Are “Shattering the Brand and Alienating Loyal Fans”</h2>



<p>Xbox founder Laura Fryer recently released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGh1-W-nYQA&amp;t=282s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> (via <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WCCFtech</a>) discussing the recent Game Pass price hikes. Fryer immediately called out the leadership, stating that she doesn’t know whether they understand “what makes Xbox great”. Fryer isn’t sure if the leadership is aware of what the community wants, as they keep “doubling down on decisions” that make it seem they are in a bubble where the “feedback doesn’t reach them anymore.”</p>



<p>Fryer adds, “That yes man culture that took over in 2008 has only gotten worse, and this is the result, a crazy price increase for their fans after announcing that Game Pass had made $5 billion.” She talks about how Xbox has failed to keep content costs stable and the leadership has forgotten “how to make games at scale”, which has led to many layoffs and cancellations. </p>



<p>The Xbox founder talks about how Xbox has thrown away one of its last advantages by increasing Game Pass prices, which had been “the best deal in gaming”. The price hike “feels like a betrayal, like greed over gaming”. </p>

<p>In other news, Microsoft recently addressed rumors surrounding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-addresses-rumors-surrounding-xbox-console-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of the Xbox consoles</a>.

"Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Days later, Epic Games issued a carefully-worded follow-up where it said it had subsequently "worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result? "To avoid any confusion," the developer continued, "we're modifying the Emote choreography in next week's update." To some, the statement seemed unclear as to whether the emote was a reference to the show's own Nazi references. If so, why was it returning? If not, why was it being changed? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, today's big Fortnite patch (which also adds the game's Halloween event Fortnitemares, as well as a first nod to its highly-anticipated The Simpsons mini-season) has now made the switch, with the Peaceful Hips emote now updated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">See the original dance emote and the updated one both below for comparison:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DC Peacemaker 'Peaceful Hips' Emote will be disabled </p><p>"As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote.

After a little sideways shimmy, each arm is then bent upwards one at a time — the movement seen by some as reminiscent of swastika. After that, there's a momentary touch of the thighs before the arms are placed behind the head and the routine ends with a generous double crotch thrust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new emote replaces that middle section with a fresh movement — with clenched fists, an arm movement up and then down — that then neatly leads in to the remainder of the choreography.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy 24 hours for Fortnite, which last night had to deal with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-halloween-plans-get-off-to-messy-start-following-social-media-snafu-involving-doja-cat-and-a-sex-toy">rap star Doja Cat breaking kayfabe to criticise the posting of a sex toy reference on the game's social media account that was designed to look like it had been written by her</a>.

                <p>If fast progression is what you're looking for in Battlefield 6, then the PlayStation 5 version might be the one to get when the shooter launches tomorrow.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1976302633410494652" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, the PS5 version of Battlefield 6 has an XP Modifier that will add 5% of XP in every match in which you're partied up with at least two PlayStation Plus subscribers. A PlayStation Plus membership is required to play online multiplayer in Battlefield 6 (and any paid game).</p><p>A screenshot shared by CharlieIntel on X shows other XP Modifiers, including a 5% boost for simply owning the game and another for just being in a party with other players.</p><p>It appears that these modifiers can stack, meaning that PS5 players who party up with at least two other people playing on PS5 would net a significant 15% XP bonus.
