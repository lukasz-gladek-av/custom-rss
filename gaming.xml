As of the end of 2024, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">sold over 150 million units</a> in the eight years since its release. That’s an impressive number, and yet…that’s <em>still </em>not enough to make it the company’s best selling piece of hardware – a distinction that belongs to the humble Nintendo DS – but it’s getting close.</p><p>The company released its earnings report earlier this week and the numbers don’t look great. Though hardware sales are down a whopping 30 percentage points compared to 2023, Nintendo has, predictably, taken an optimistic stance. After all, this console is eight years old <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">with the Switch 2</a> tantalizingly close to launch. And in light of all that, it still sold almost 10 million units. But that impressive 150 million unit total is still a bit short of the massive 154 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its 12-year lifetime. Bolstered by recent games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and with new games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> on the horizon, it’s likely that the Switch will finally overtake the DS this year, making it Nintendo’s best selling console ever.</p><p>After that, there’s one more boss for the console to beat before it can be called the best-selling console of all time – the 160 million units of the PlayStation 2. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game is set to arrive on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/atari-vcs-2600-console-crypto-nft-financial-report-1849920146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/atari-vcs-2600-console-crypto-nft-financial-report-1849920146">Atari’s weird PC-in-a-box console.</a></span> </p><p>Now, if you just watch this trailer, you might assume this is just a new <em>Breakout</em> game that looks cool and move on. And that’s probably what Atari is hoping most people do. However, this particular version of <em>Breakout</em> has a weird history that goes back to 2019 and the doomed Amico. </p><p>Remember the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-tommy-tallarico-delay-debts-layoffs-1849037546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-tommy-tallarico-delay-debts-layoffs-1849037546">Amico</a></span>? Probably not. Here’s a very short explanation: In 2018 video game composer and jerk Tommy Tallarico announced plans to create a new Intellivision-branded console focused on affordable games and family fun. A number of games (mostly ports of mobile and web titles) were planned to launch alongside the Amico, including a new version of <em>Breakout </em>developed by Choice Provisions. Of all the Amico games, this new <em>Breakout </em>was the one most people were excited about. </p><p>Here’s the reveal trailer for Amico’s Breakout game: </p><p>And then years of mismanagement, delays, covid-19, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-is-selling-nft-games-for-a-console-that-a-1847836174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-is-selling-nft-games-for-a-console-that-a-1847836174">NFT nonsense</a></span> and more occurred, and here we are in 2025 and the Amico is still not on shelves. If you want to learn more about the car crash that is the Amico, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271">click here</a></span>. </p><p> Anyway, in 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atari bought the Intellivision brand and its games</a></span>, but not the Amico console. For a while now, people have wondered what happened to that cool looking <em>Breakout </em>game. Was it doomed to never see the light of day? Nope! Atari realized it had a possible banger on its hands and is finally getting around to releasing the game on actual platforms people own and use. </p><p>That brings us to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041770/Breakout_Beyond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041770/Breakout_Beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Breakout Beyond</em></a></span>, the “new” game announced today for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. (No release date was provided.) It’s nice to see this thing escaping the Amico to get a chance to launch and be played. Hopefully <em>Breakout Beyond </em>is worth the wait. At least now nobody needs to buy an Amico, assuming the doomed console actually comes out one day. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>MLB The Show 25 will be out this March, and as the first game in years to not release on day one for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-launches-in-march-but-wont-be-on-game-pass-this-year/1100-6529072/" data-ref-id="1100-6529072">Game Pass</a>, Sony's San Diego Studio had to make the case for you to spend your money at launch. New features coming to the game this year might just do that, with the sometimes-stagnant Road to the Show mode getting a big upgrade and Diamond Dynasty ditching a system players took issue with.</p><p>Rather than complete a simple combine exercise before getting drafted by an MLB team, this year's Road to the Show mode will let you begin your career as a high-school player before making the jump to college and the pros.</p><p>Authentic amateur-level audio has been included specifically for this, such as the loud "ping" of aluminum bats and the distinct crash of a player hitting a chain-link fence. Elsewhere, "hundreds" of new gameplay animations have been added, along with a new G.O.A.T. difficulty setting and an "ambush hitting" system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G33itOzDkM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0G33itOzDkM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Road to the Show's progression system has also been overhauled, which Sony says gives you "more control over your player's development, including crafting Perks to your liking." With any luck, it should help your players from falling too neatly into one of a few different archetypes, as they could in years past.</p><p>Diamond Dynasty has also gotten some big changes. The Sets and Seasons system, which limited the players you could take into an online ranked match, have been removed. A new tabletop-like Diamond Quest mode and the multiplayer Weekend Classic have also been added, giving you another way to earn rewards.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, MLB The Show 25 sees the return of Storylines with The Negro Leagues Season 3. Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president Bob Kendrick is back to showcase some of the greatest baseball players of all time in an educational mode that always features some unique game situations.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 releases on March 18 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Switch.

The first is pretty reasonable: They wanted someone who could <em>play</em> the part more than just <em>look</em> the part.</p><p>“We value performance over anything else,” Druckmann said. “We need someone to really capture the essence of those characters... We don’t value as much, ‘Do they look exactly like the character with their eyebrows or their nose or their body?’ Whatever it is. It’s not nowhere on the priority list, but it’s below a bunch of other things that we consider.”</p><p>But the second reason is where I raise an eyebrow. Druckmann goes on to explain that because the show isn’t recreating the mechanics of playing <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, they didn’t see the need to differentiate Abby’s physicality from Bella Ramsey’s Ellie.</p><p>“We would’ve struggled to find someone as good as Kaitlyn to play this role,” Druckmann explains. “In the game, you have to play both characters [Ellie and Abby] and we need them to play differently. We needed Ellie to feel smaller and kind of maneuver around, and Abby was meant to play more like Joel in that she’s almost like a brute in the way she can physically manhandle certain things. That doesn’t play as big of a role in this version of the story because there’s not as much violent action moment to moment. It’s more about the drama. I’m not saying there’s no action here. It’s just, again, different priorities and how you approach it.”</p><figure id="" data-id="cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-recommend-id="image://cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1893" data-height="1065" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks down at something off-screen covered in blood and other wounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby looks down at something off-screen covered in blood and other wounds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-recommend-id="image://cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1893" data-height="1065" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks down at something off-screen covered in blood and other wounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yeah, Abby having a different kit played into her brute strength, but I think boiling down her muscular build to something entirely mechanical is a bit reductive. We see Abby through a few different points in her life in<em> The Last of Us Part II</em>, and her physical transformation echoes her emotional one. She starts working out as a reaction to her father’s murder, and by the time she is ready to avenge him, she’s physically unrecognizable from the small child she was when he passed. It’s as much a sign of her emotional arc as it is a mechanical tool for Naughty Dog’s developers to implement. She’s obsessive, and exercise is as much an outlet to channel her anger as it is a means of survival. I’m curious to see how the show finds some other way to communicate that part of her if Dever isn’t going to bulk up.</p><p><em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season premieres in April and will include at least a few new characters, in addition to the ones from the game. <em>Schitt’s Creek </em>actor Catherine O’Hara plays one new role, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/catherine-ohara-the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-1851749776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/catherine-ohara-the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-1851749776">apparently bringing some levity to an otherwise dark story</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We don’t know what the future holds for the studio, but we can celebrate its past by looking back at some of the best moments from its various series. Spoilers for all four games follow.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> begins with one of six playable opening chapters, the one you play based on the race and class of character you choose, providing a unique background for your character before they head out into the main story.</p><p>The Hero of Ferelden can be part of human nobility facing a tragic series of losses, a castless dwarf struggling to make it in the city of Orzamar, or a mage evicted from the magic school they’ve known their entire life, and those starkly different origin points are only half of the options. These origins define how your hero will be viewed in the dozens of hours that follow, and also function as a starting point for how a new player will view the franchise. I started as a Mage when I first played <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>in 2009, and have always felt like a veteran of the Circle at heart. Future <em>Dragon Age </em>games would implement this concept of different player backgrounds with <em>Inquisition </em>and <em>The Veilguard</em>, but none would do it as thoroughly—<em>Origins </em>was the only time I got to see that history play out in real-time.</p></div><div><p>No character in <em>Origins </em>is as impactful as Morrigan, the enigmatic Witch of the Wilds. The apostate carries a sense of superiority toward the rest of the party, as well as the trials and tribulations of Thedas. When you meet her in the early hours of <em>Origins</em>, you still don’t know much about the world, but her commanding presence elevated by Claudia Black’s excellent voice performance tells you that she is unlike anyone or anything you’ve met so far. Morrigan is one of the few characters in <em>Dragon Age </em>who watches nearly every important moment in Thedas’ history unfold, so seeing her here, both enigmatic but still so young and naive, is chilling to look back on.</p></div><div><p>After you’ve picked your background and lived out whatever trauma is associated with it, <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>puts you at the center of a battle with a darkspawn horde. Your job is to signal for reinforcements to help defeat an army of bloodthirsty monsters, but before the battle starts, the vibes seem off. The golden retriever King Cailain is jazzed about the incoming battle, though his father-in-law Loghain Mac Tir seems less enthusiastic. The tension between the two is tangible, but who are you to get involved in royal family affairs? However, when you signal for reinforcements, Loghain instead commands his forces to retreat, leaving everyone, including you and his own son-in-law, for dead at the hands of the Blight. Most of the preceding origin stories are full of some kind of betrayal. You might think you would get some respite from it at some point, but <em>Origins </em>doubles down, reminding you that you know nothing of this world and the lengths people will go to get what they want.</p></div><div><p><em>Origins </em>is not an entirely grimdark fantasy drama—some of the best character interactions come from your party members hanging out with your dog companion. Though Mabari dogs are trained to be vicious combatants, your canine companion is a sweetheart. Many interactions between the party and dog give him a hard time for being a mangy mutt, only for him to be revealed as a sensitive soul who just wants to play. Examine your preconceived notions, <em>Origins </em>crew. The sharp fangs mask that the Mabari is actually a good boy.</p></div><div><p>There are several points in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series in which a party member can turn on you, but none have ever been quite as shocking as when the religious bard Leliana, and otherwise kind-hearted Wynne, turn on you if you taint the Urn of Sacred Ashes. This is a crime against one of the most prominent doctrines in all of Thedas, and bringing two of the most devout members of the party to watch is bound to cause drama, but <em>Origins </em>takes it a step further by having both of your teammates take up arms against you.</p><p>It doesn’t matter how far you’ve progressed through their personal stories, or even if you’re involved in a romance with Leliana; faith trumps all other emotions here, and you will have to strike down your allies. You’ll face plenty more betrayals during the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but Leliana and Wynne’s heel turn is still one of the most sudden and violent. </p></div><div><p>Much like killing Leliana, <em>Origins </em>has a few choices whose ramifications were so earth-shattering that BioWare later had to write themselves out of the box they’d created so they could re-use characters that could be dead. One of those was the option to kill Flemeth, Morrigan’s even more enigmatic mother who allegedly wanted to steal her daughter’s body as a vessel to live longer, though the reality is a bit more nuanced than that. When Morrigan finds out about this plan, she begs you to slay the old woman in her hut in the woods. You can choose to do so or strike a deal with her to spare her in exchange for her grimoire of old spells, but choosing to slay her means fighting her in a powerful dragon form. It’s a tough fight, but doing so leaves you not with a rewarding cutscene and major story revelation, but instead an unsettling and anticlimactic quiet. You’re left with more mysteries than you had when you arrived, and the unshakable feeling that you might have killed something far beyond your understanding. Flemeth’s place in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe was too significant to be silenced by something as trivial as death, but for a moment, you feel like you have driven a stake through the heart of something you cannot comprehend.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>’ big moment where all your choices culminate is The Landsmeet, a political meeting where you can finally unmask Loghain for all his crimes and essentially set up the country of Ferelden’s future. Your relationships and understandings formed over the past 50+ hours of video game are put to the test, and things can change drastically depending on how the battles of wits and blades pan out. To this day, The Landsmeet is one of BioWare’s most effective showcases of its ability to sew hours of choices into a final consequence. In just one quest you solidify the future for Ferelden in a way that sends most players down the same path, but colors that result so differently that many players, especially those who don’t know every secret the game has to offer, will see something that diverges significantly from what the next player might see.</p></div><div><p>One of the last major choices you’ll make in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> comes back to Morrigan. The witch has had more than enough reasons to leave the party considering she doesn’t really get along with anyone on the team, but she sticks around long enough to give you a final choice: ending the Blight will cost you your life—unless you or Alistair undergoes a blood magic ritual that will transfer the Archdemon’s soul into an unborn child. It sounds like a get-out-of-jail-free card, all you have to do is lay with her for one night or convince Alistair to do it. But Morrigan is cagey with her intentions and says that whether you agree or not, she will leave the party after the final battle. This is why she’s been here this whole time, but does that mean any connection you’ve formed with her was all an act? What will become of this child? Is it going to be like any other child or will it be some darkspawn demon that could bring about just as much pain in the world as the archdemon would? Morrigan gives you nothing to go on, but makes her terms clear. <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>would go on to have three sequels that would wipe away the ambiguity of this decision, but at the time, all you had to go on here was your trust of Morrigan, or lack thereof. Everything you’ve ever been told about blood magic and interrupting the natural order of the Blight should tell you to say “no,” but are you willing to risk it to save your own life? It’s a fascinating choice. Did <em>Dragon Age</em> do right by it? Your mileage may vary.</p></div><div><p>With <em>Dragon Age II</em>, BioWare started earnestly looking for a way to franchise the series. It had built itself a new cage as the “choice and consequence” studio thanks to the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, and <em>Dragon Age </em>followed suit by importing your <em>Origins </em>save to pepper in cameos and references to your past deeds. That includes whether or not you killed Flemeth, but since BioWare still wanted to use the mysterious witch either way, it had new hero Hawke unwittingly carry her to safety through an enchanted amulet even as she fought for her life against the Hero of Ferelden. Reviving Flemeth is one of the most effective moments in all of <em>Dragon Age </em>in showing how playing as different protagonists in each game could create satisfying meta moments. As she rises from the ashes, you watch the impact of one of your hero’s actions be undermined by the one you’re playing as now. <em>Dragon Age </em>takes place over decades, and a big part of its appeal is watching different stories you’ve helped write weave in and out of one another. It’s a course correction, but one that is still bone-chilling to watch unfold.</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Dragon Age </em>differs from the first in several ways, from taking place almost entirely in one city to swapping the tactical RPG battle system for more action-oriented combat. But one of the most notable and interesting changes it made was to the approval system, which integrated a Friendship and Rivalry mechanic so you didn’t have to kiss a party member’s ass to progress their relationship storyline. The difference between Friendship and Rivalry is all about how you challenge their preconceived notions. Each party member has a pretty defined view of the world; the radical mage Anders, for instance, is all about freeing magic users from the Circle at any cost, while the elven slave Fenris has an aversion to magic. Uncritically enabling them will give you Friendship points, and going against the grain will net you Rivalry points. This changes the tone of your relationships significantly, and even someone you’re in a romantic relationship with may greet you with a thorny disposition. Watching those connections gradually change is one of the most compelling parts of <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s writing. Romancing Fenris as a mage while being rivals was one of the most interesting, angsty relationships I’ve ever experienced in a BioWare game. It’s a shame the studio didn’t keep the system around.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age II</em> is all about years of civil unrest bubbling to the surface of one city, and between the conflict with the stranded Qunari and the Mage/Templar War, the former is certainly handled with more care than the latter. While early <em>Dragon Age </em>games had multiple crisis points in which party members can leave the party or betray you, one of the most memorable is when one party member makes a decision not to leave, but to return. Isabela is the cause of the Qunari’s extended stay in Kirkwall, and when she’s given the chance to run off with a tome they have been searching for, she takes it. If you’ve not established a solid enough friendship or rivalry with her, she will never return. If you have, she makes a big hero’s entrance just as the Qunari are about to strike down what remains of the city. She attempts to make amends, showing the growth she’s been trying her damnedest to avoid since arriving in the city. But then the Qunari leader says she still must answer for her crimes. You can give her up and betray her, or you can fight for her instead, and seeing her be big enough to not sell you and the rest of Kirkwall out for once in her life is one of <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s most memorable companion moments.</p></div><div><p>Choosing to fight for Isabela’s freedom results in a somewhat silly but exceptionally satisfying fight. <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s action-based combat isn’t quite as snappy and tight as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s, but it has some spectacle that can keep it interesting in fights that don’t just pit you against waves of enemies being thrown at you. The Arishok fight can go a few ways depending on if he respects Hawke or not, but fighting the giant Qunari in a one-on-one duel is still one of the best combat sequences in the game. You may be in for a tough time if you haven’t spec’d into a class and build that can handle a solo fight, but in any case, taking down the Arishok and being crowned the Champion of Kirkwall is one of the defining moments of <em>Dragon Age II</em>.</p></div><div><p>One bright spot in <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s extremely uneven final act is the conclusion to Merrill’s story. The elven blood mage has gone against the wishes of everyone around her in a tunnel-visioned need to bring back a part of her clan’s history, even seeking out the help of a demon. <em>Dragon Age II</em> takes place across a decade, with Merrill at odds with her clan leader Marethari all the while, and yet the leader sacrifices herself to “save” Merrill by allowing the demon she had been working with to possess her instead. Merrill can insist this was meddling and you can be supportive of her or not, but the real people she has to answer to are the clan’s remaining members. Depending on whether you advocate for her or throw her under the bus, you may have to fight the entire clan on your way out. It’s a brutal mess that’s tied to the character with perhaps the most emotional range of any party member in the franchise. It’s such a terrifying, saddening web of contradicting feelings and subverted expectations, all leading to a stunning payoff.</p></div><div><p>I have a lot of issues with the handling of the Mage/Templar War in <em>Dragon Age II</em>. It creates this complicated political and religious conflict around an oppressed group of people and a tyrannical religious organization but insists that both sides are equally bad, actually. Don’t even get me started on how you can convince Anders, the radical mage who is the face of this conflict, to kill the mages he tried to save. But the moment in which Anders, worn down by a lifetime of captivity and oppression, blows up the Kirkwall Chantry is one of the few unambiguous statements the game makes in its final hours. The scene itself is dramatic and shocking and kickstarts a war that would (in theory) shake the foundations of Thedas. It requires everyone in your party to make a stand. There will be no more fence-sitting in this fight, and all your relationships will be tested as your team decides whether or not to follow you into battle. Sadly, the reveals that follow undermine any choice you make, but as a spark that ignites a flame, Anders’ act of terrorism is a statement in a game that otherwise seems unwilling to make one.</p></div><div><p>A lot of the highlights we’ve talked about are big story moments or reactions to your decisions, but one of the coolest things <em>Inquisition </em>does happens literally the moment the game starts. The main menu shows rows of mages and templars marching toward a building off in the distance. Despite where we left them in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, these two opposing sides don’t seem to be fighting, so perhaps they’re making their way to peace talks? Could the future of <em>Dragon Age </em>be written not in blood, but in signed treaties? Let’s press “new game” and find o-</p><p>Oh.</p></div><div><p>I have heard some fans say the moment in which members of the Inquisition start singing “The Dawn Will Come,” a hymn of the Chantry, to your main character in a moment of religious fervor is cheesy and cringe, to which I say, fuck you, it’s one of the most incredible moments in the game. <em>Inquisition</em>’s themes can be radically different depending on how you play the Herald of Andraste. This hero has been unwillingly made a religious figure, with hundreds of people expecting you to live as a symbol for a god you might not even believe in. If you take this approach, playing as a non-believer who actively shouts down the claims of the faithful, “The Dawn Will Come” can be an unnerving, haunting reminder of how much unwavering belief can compel groups of people even as you insist on a different, provable truth. If, on the other hand, you’re undecided or playing as a believer, it can read like a beautiful moment of hope and community. <em>Inquisition </em>allows you to define so many shades of who your character is and see them reflected in a world that struggles with your very existence. And sometimes, no matter how hard you kick and scream, you cannot stop the world from believing what it does. Instead, you can just awkwardly stand there while people sing to you and then complain about it later.</p></div><div><p>With each subsequent game, <em>Dragon Age </em>has gotten better at illustrating the closeness (or lack thereof) of your companions. Banter in the overworld is good, but seeing the crew actually get together is better. The Wicked Grace scene, in which the party gets together to play a card game, is one of BioWare’s best scenes that make use of a game’s entire core ensemble. Everyone’s personality gets a chance to shine, whether they’re playful, stuffy, horny, or just trying to wrangle all these weirdos together. It’s delightful, succinct, and has stayed in the hearts of many <em>Dragon Age </em>fans.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Dragon Age </em>series has always been explicitly queer. For all the diaper-shitting about <em>The Veilguard</em>’s queer themes, <em>Inquisition </em>was examining the life and times of a Thedas gay long before Taash learned the term “non-binary.” Dorian Pavus’ personal quest remains one of the most memorable in all of BioWare’s canon. It drops combat for one incredibly well-acted cutscene between the Tevinter mage and his estranged father, where it’s revealed that, to continue their bloodline and climb his way up the Tevinter political ladder, Dorian’s father planned to use a blood magic equivalent to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversion therapy</a></span> in order to force his son into an arranged marriage. I’ve spoken to many <em>Dragon Age </em>fans over the years about what decision they made here, as you’re able to help the two reconcile, or to get Dorian out of there. I’ve never once considered telling Dorian to hear his father out. It’s one of the best examples I’ve seen of a game adapting the queer struggle to a fictional culture. Dorian becomes a radical because he has seen how low even those he loves will go to maintain power in Tevinter, and it all ties into his identity as a gay man. It’s a stunning scene that tells you so much about Dorian and where he came from, and lets you gently nudge history as you stand beside him.</p></div><div><p>Blackwall goes under the radar for a lot of players. He’s quiet, keeps to himself, and is even in a pretty out-of-the-way spot in your base in Skyhold. A lot of people think the Grey Warden warrior is boring, but they’re wrong; the big reveals you experience in his companion missions are outstanding. Blackwall tells you he’s a Warden but is secretive about the organization which, if you played <em>Origins</em>, may nudge you to think back to your own experience playing as one. You know why they’re all tight-lipped on the inner machinations of the faction, so you don’t question it. But it turns out, he’s actually not a Warden at all, and is instead an imposter on the run for war crimes he committed years ago. Eventually, the guilt eats at him and he turns himself in to save others from answering for his orders with a hangman’s noose. This man duped you for dozens of hours, and you’re left with the power to decide his fate. Blackwall’s quest can go one of several ways, whether you leave him to rot, pardon him, or send him to the Wardens to let them decide what happens to an imposter. Whatever you choose, Blackwall’s quest leaves an impression as one of BioWare’s most surprising and subversive. Y’all need to quit calling characters you don’t even talk to boring. This shit rips.</p></div><div><p>Even as someone who likes <em>Mass Effect </em>more than <em>Dragon Age</em>, I have a hard time thinking of a singular quest in the sci-fi series that matches up to <em>Inquisition</em>’s Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts. While you will unsheathe your weapons a few times, this mission is all about politics, charming the worst people you’ve ever met, and working the crowd. Running around the Winter Palace, meeting the most powerful players in Orlais, and manipulating the politics of an entire country to your whims is more intriguing than anything you do with a sword or staff. Mechanically, the mission is surprisingly elegant as it codifies social status and attention into something that can be measured by a video game, and it’s intriguing learning more about the figureheads you can rally to your cause. There are several outcomes at the end of this mission, and getting what you want might come down to blackmail, reuniting long-lost lovers, or a betrayal of your own. It’s unlike anything else in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, and I haven’t seen many studios pull off something like it since.</p></div><div><p>At one point, it seemed as if Flemeth might be the throughline connecting all of <em>Dragon Age</em>. For two games, she was presented as a manipulator, lurking in the shadows and moving the pieces of Thedas’ chess board to her liking. Then all her machinations finally came to a head in <em>Inquisition</em> when she, Morrigan, and perhaps the child the player helped conceive two games prior, all gather in the Fade. Flemeth seemingly has control of the situation, appearing to hold her grandson Kieran hostage and using him as leverage against her daughter who has been on the run since <em>Origins</em>. But as anger gives way to truth-telling and the moment softens, the two find not total reconciliation, but at least an understanding that neither is in danger from the other. It is a series-best performance from Black and Flemeth actor Kate Mulgrew, bringing together three games of choices and history into one incredible confrontation. I’m still unsure how I feel about the final echoes of this moment in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but Flemeth and her family reuniting and acknowledging the struggle of love and fear for one another that they’re caught in remains one of the most memorable interactions in all of <em>Dragon Age</em>.</p></div><div><p>I could just throw the entirety of the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC in here and it would be in the running for best “moments” in the series. The final expansion BioWare released for <em>Inquisition </em>in 2015 isn’t just an epilogue for the RPG, but is pretty much the true ending. You say goodbye to all the companions with some silly, heartfelt scenes, engage in some politics, and fight some really memorable battles, but the meat of the DLC is in its final 10 minutes. Solas, the elven apostate who abandons your team at the very end, reveals that he is the Dread Wolf, the trickster god who led a rebellion against the rest of the elven pantheon. He plans to tear down the barrier between the real and spirit worlds, which he believes will revitalize the old world of the elves, granting them immortality once more and destroying everyone else in the process. But you’re given two choices that (before <em>The Veilguard</em>, at least)<em> </em>felt incredibly meaningful as a final word for the Inquisitor: Do you think Solas is beyond saving? And is your organization in a state to fight him? Ultimately, neither of those choices mattered in <em>The Veilguard</em>, despite them being imported into the game at the beginning. But back in 2015 it felt like a victory lap, a final declaration by a character you probably wouldn’t get to play again.</p></div><div><p>BioWare has always been held up as a studio that spearheads inclusive design, but <em>The Veilguard </em>takes this one step further by letting you explicitly determine that your protagonist Rook is trans. This isn’t just a cosmetic choice like giving them top surgery scars or picking a voice; it can be part of your character’s backstory that you talk about from time to time with other characters. Few games have been this thorough about letting you define your character’s identity, and <em>The Veilguard </em>approaches it with a great deal of care.</p></div><div><p><em>The Veilguard </em>continues the trend, started with <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, of BioWare hiding some of a game’s biggest lore reveals behind an optional collectathon, but this time they are so far-reaching and important that I can’t believe some players may never see them. Collecting wolf statues throughout <em>The Veilguard </em>reveals Solas’ regrets. These are murals depicting memories from the elven god’s long life, and essentially write the creation myth of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe. When I first played <em>The Veilguard</em>, I did these quests pretty late and they started to turn me around on the game entirely. I had mostly considered <em>The Veilguard</em> less a meal than a series of really good sides, but this was when I as a long-time fan felt like I was really eating. Each reveal was juicier and more surprising than the last, bringing connective tissue to a universe that had often felt disparate and disconnected. God, I can’t believe they’re optional.</p></div><div><p>A lot of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s choices are binary, but most of them are still pretty compelling. The first world-altering choice comes when you must decide which of two cities to save from incoming dragon attacks: Minrathous or Treviso. There’s a lot of emotion tied up in this choice, as well as tactical considerations to make. Your Rook might be from Minrathous, but pursuing a relationship with Treviso native Lucanis. You may be trying to develop partnerships with the radical Tevinter group the Shadow Dragons and feel like you should help them defend their city to not burn bridges. Whatever your reasoning and whatever the consequences, you have to choose right then and there. Your teammates are looking to you for an answer, and you realize that a mere few hours of gameplay ago you were just a contractor helping Varric track down Solas. Rook’s arc is all about them confronting the leadership role that has been thrust on them by circumstance and Varric’s expectations. This is the moment it becomes clear that they might not be cut out for the decisions they have to make, but they’ll have to learn to live with those choices one way or another.</p></div><div><p>The Mourn Watch necromancer Emmrich is <em>The Veilguard</em>’s best marriage of character and faction culture. He is fascinated by death because he has an all-consuming fear of the end. Emmrich’s goal is to become a Lich, an immortal keeper of the dead, willing to watch life begin and end forevermore. But as his personal quests unfold, his assistant Manfred, a reanimated skeleton, is killed in a battle with a rival Lich. Using his powers, he could bring Manfred back, but doing so would disqualify him from achieving the immortality he desires, as it would show an inability to accept death. How can you be immortal and watch everything live and die in an endless cycle if one death of a loved one compels you to defy the natural order? I’ve heard people make cases for allowing Emmrich to become a Lich, but I chose to advise him to bring Manfred back and leave Lichdom behind. The Lich order may believe his inability to leave Manfred behind as a weakness, but I saw it as an asset. It’s proof that he loves too strongly to spend an eternity watching everyone he cares about disappear over and over again. Still, I see the argument for the other side. No other choice in <em>The Veilguard </em>so succinctly nails the companion-first format BioWare wanted while saying so much about the world in the process.</p></div><div><p>The Grey Warden headquarters of Weisshaupt has been referenced since the very beginning of <em>Dragon Age</em>, and after all those years hyping it up, our first experience of it is one hell of a followthrough. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s mission at the fortress is an action-packed and narratively rewarding setpiece packed with reveals about the state of the Grey Wardens and demonstrating just how much of a threat the remaining elven gods pose. Meanwhile, the drama it stirs between your team of usually harmonious heroes is a peak moment for the whole series, and holy shit, that boss fight at the end might be the most challenging BioWare’s ever created.</p></div><div><p>After you see all of Solas’ regrets, you meet a visitor in the Lighthouse: Morrigan. She gives you one last big lore dump, finally putting a bittersweet bow on the tragic story between her and her mother. She also reveals to you that the figure that has been looming over their hit-and-run relationship is Mythal, the elven god of love who once led the pantheon. Mythal is long dead, but her memories have transferred from host to host in the millennia since. Morrigan is the keeper of her memories now, and believes that if even a fraction of the old god were able to release Solas from all his regret, it might be enough to take him off this violent path. Morrigan’s epilogue is introspective and melancholy, but as she directs you to one of the last pieces of Mythal’s soul trapped in the fade, all that family drama is given some meaning. The conversation in which you try to convince Mythal to help you is one of the best in <em>The Veilguard</em>. It branches into multiple topics, giving you several footholds to perhaps convince her that your cause is just. Who your Rook is can play into how effective you are in making your case, and if you can’t persuade her, you can always fight her for her favor. Whatever route you choose, this is one of those moments in which you can feel <em>Dragon Age </em>history changing with every dialogue option you pick.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s final missions are a kind of greatest hits of BioWare’s best tricks. It’s got everything: unavoidable sacrifice, avoidable losses determined by whether or not you know your team well enough to assign them tasks befitting their talents, and a culmination of all the strategic relationships you’ve built with different factions. It might not be as interactive as <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s Suicide Mission, but as a series of interlocking decisions bringing you to a myriad of mini conclusions, it far exceeds anything the studio has done in the past 20 years. I was nervous and shaking making those choices, and it’s all portrayed with a level of cinematic finesse that goes beyond anything BioWare’s done before.</p></div><div><p>When <em>The Veilguard </em>reaches its climax, it becomes clear that all the while, you’ve been caught in a battle of ideals between Varric’s hope and Solas’ cynicism. Rook has been a pawn (no pun intended) for Solas. The elf has been manipulating them the entire time in hopes of trapping them in the Fade and resuming his plan. He’s done this by projecting a vision of Varric who hypes Rook up until they can be cut off at the knees, falling into a state of regret so consuming it traps them within the spirit realm. Here, they’re guided by Varric through the prison until they discover the truth: Varric died at the beginning of the game, and Solas used his image to nudge Rook along the entire game.</p><p>The reveal is incredible because you realize BioWare pulled off a <em>Sixth Sense</em>. No one else speaks to Varric the entire game, but he’s placed naturally enough in each scene that you don’t really question that no one else responds to him. You realize that you’ve been fooled by Solas just as much as Rook has, and when they mourn their mentor’s loss, they’re effectively a stand-in for you, the <em>Dragon Age </em>fan. But as despondent as they might be, they still have a job to do, and Varric reminds them that they’ve done everything up to this point by themself. They don’t need Varric’s guidance. They already have everything they need.</p><p>As frustrated as I was with <em>The Veilguard</em>’s decision to leave the Inquisitor behind for a new protagonist, this twist was what made Rook work for me. The whole game essentially emerges from Varric betting on someone to finish the job he couldn’t. His belief in Rook is what keeps the game going, even as Solas tries to manipulate it to his own advantage. It may have been sad to watch Varric go from a city dwarf just trying to make it to a victim of Solas’ pride, but his belief in others lives on. </p></div><div><p>After four games, pretty much everything <em>Dragon Age </em>has ever been leads to one final conversation with Solas. The Veil is coming down, the rest of Thedas will be burned to ash in the aftermath, and the only way to stop it is for the trickster god himself to bind himself to it. No matter what you do, Solas will end up using his immortal life force to keep Thedas and the Fade separate. But the tenor of your decision still matters. You can knock him senseless and forcibly cast the blood magic spell to hold him there, you can trick him so his magic backfires and leave him helpless as you bind him to the Veil, or you can take the third option. Bringing Mythal’s essence out allows her to release him from her service, letting him lay down a lifetime of regret. It’s the culmination of learning all the secrets left in this world, and once you have all that understanding, it feels like the most appropriate way to cap off a cliffhanger whose resolution we’ve been awaiting for ten years.</p><p>After everything that’s happened to BioWare in the months following <em>The Veilguard</em>’s launch, what sticks out to me most is how much the game leans into finality. Closure is a key pillar of its storytelling, even if there are hints toward a sequel we may never get. And if this is the note we leave off on, I won’t be upset. I hope most of the team that was at BioWare at any point during the series’ development won’t be either.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlatinumGames has now lost the game directors for Bayonetta 3, Astral Chain, Metal Gear Rising, and other titles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5iRwbkbVQQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> by former PlatinumGames vice president Hideki Kamiya revealed that the development studio will lose five prominent staff members. The departed employees include the game directors of some of the studio’s most popular titles: Yusuke Miyata from Bayonetta 3, Adebe Tinari from Bayonetta Origins, who has left for HouseMarque, Takahisa Taura from Astral Chain, Kenji Saito from Metal Gear Rising, and Masaki Yamanaka, the character designer for Resident Evil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hideki Kamiya revealed the developers’ exit from PlatinumGames in the last section of his video, where the development studio’s employees were seen having a party. Kamiya also asked the audience to support the newly departed developers, stating that people create games and that creativity will follow wherever they go.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Hideki Kamiya, the former vice president of PlatinumGames, created his own studio, Clovers, which Capcom backs. Kamiya’s first work for the new studio will feature Okami 2. The video didn’t reveal what the other game directors will do next.  </p>

			<p>The sports game that everyone has been waiting for is finally going into Early Access on PC on March 20, 2025. Wreckfest 2, a title that will have extreme full-contact racing and chaos, will be bigger and better than ever. The developers stated that the physics engine has been significantly overhauled so that the crashes are more intense than ever and deeper component damage. Of course, there will be the iconic mayhem of the races that everyone loves, but now it's even more detailed than before. This title was one of the most highly anticipated racing and sports games in<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/"> our 2025 round-up</a>.</p>
<p>For those who want to see what they can expect from Wreckfest 2's Early Access period, make sure to check out the trailer below to see some of the adrenaline rushes you can experience in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>High-speed circuits make a return, and you'll even get to race and crash through a junkyard, which can make for some intense collisions. More than that, you'll also get to try and attempt some serious jumps, which can help you get ahead of the opponent while weaving through oncoming traffic at busy intersections. Compared to other racing games, Wreckfest 2 is a game where no rules apply, and it's every driver for themselves. You will be racing against up to 23 other players or AI drivers, depending on what you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Instead of sparkly supercars to race through the tracks, the cars you choose will be patchwork jobs full of dents, rust, and broken parts to really add to the grime and grittiness of Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>Early Access will continue to progress and add new content, and during this time, you'll be able to build your very own car from the ground up and turn it into a force to be reckoned with. There will be new cars added to the game, as well as other vehicles to come in the future as the game continues to develop and evolve.</p>
<p>Consumer feedback is essential to the developers during the Early Access period and will all be taken on board so that it can be refined and reshaped as needed during Early Access.</p>
<p>For those on PC and want to get stuck into Wreckfest 2, make sure to wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> so you'll be notified when the game officially enters the Early Access period on PC.</p>

<p>Kamiya doesn't state in the video whether any of the folks in the photo have joined his new studio Clovers or whether they'll be moving on to other ventures within the gaming industry, although at the very least, it seems plausible that&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>'s Taura is <a href="https://x.com/NSK29_0916/status/1869213824198599053" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting his own studio</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, these departures follow some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-quietly-removes-all-mentions-of-project-gg-from-website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rather odd changes</a> to PlatinumGames' website. A number of games, including titles like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>World of Demons</em>, and the previously-teased&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.</em>, have all been removed from the site's listings.</p>

<p>It seems the studio has removed games that are no longer available, which presumably also means&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the fact that they're completely gone from PlatinumGames' list feels a touch like revisionist history.</p>

<p>The sequel is likely some way away from being released, but it's nice to know that Kamiya is getting to work on a project in which he'd <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-would-like-to-make-new-viewtiful-joe-and-okami-games-comments-on" rel="nofollow">previously expressed interest</a>. Maybe now we can hope for that new&nbsp;<em>Viewtiful Joe&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>alongside Team Ninja. The game was revealed during last month's Xbox Developer Direct and is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012110" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ninja-gaiden-4/9p0sq1s72g4j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been having a great time with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a><em>. </em>I do my dailies, grind for materials, and desperately search for an outfit that works with the single ugliest piece of clothing in the game: a red vest. But as I’ve progressed, the game has given me — a gacha newbie — an unfortunate crash-course education on how these games really work and what not to do if you want to keep your sanity and your wallet intact.</p><p>The trouble began right before the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year event</a>, when I started obtaining every piece of a special outfit called Wings of Wishes. In <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, special outfits like Wings of Wishes are gated behind what’s called Resonance Events, which are essentially slot machines available for a limited time. When you spend currency in the game, you’re not buying outfits outright; you’re paying to “pull” the lever on that slot machine in hopes that it’ll spit out the pieces you want. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>This is the best I can do styling this hideous red vest. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>Throughout the month Wings of Wishes was available, I managed to earn eight of its nine pieces, even though I wasn’t really trying to get it. And as the event wound down, I was confident that even if I ran out of currency, I’d simply earn enough back for the final piece. But once I exhausted all the story and event quests, I learned that the game does not reward currency at a pace that can keep up with even casual, intermittent pulling. I went from earning enough to pull 10 or 20 times a week down to four or five times. It was like that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/when-you-get-paid-biweekly">paycheck meme</a>, where, in the first week after you get paid, you’re eating steak and caviar for dinner, but by the second, you’re having ice soup. It got so dire that, by the end of the event, I started spending money hoping I’d pull the last piece, but I never did. </p><p>I was crushed, not only for obvious reasons but also because playing this game wasn’t supposed to change my spending habits. And I learned through consulting with my gacha veteran friends and the <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subreddit that I made the rookiest of mistakes in thinking I could outsmart a game engineered to part me from my money in ways I wouldn’t really notice or feel. </p><p>Gacha games have a poor reputation because of the way they can exploit players to extract their money. I got got because I thought I was above that, not realizing the game had already tapped into my FOMO and my wallet. Nothing, not even Wings of Wishes, was ever so desirable that it was worth focusing on. It only became a focus when I realized I needed <em>one more piece</em> right before the event ended. On top of that, I never noticed my spending. I wasn’t concerned because I wasn’t dropping $30–$50, but I was spending two dollars, three dollars, 99 cents, two and three times a day, because again, all I needed was <em>one more piece</em>. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>I spent so much money I didn’t intend trying to complete this Wings of Wishes outfit that I don’t even like!</em></figcaption></p></div><p>True blue gacha veterans will tell you that if there’s something you want, be prepared to either pay for it or plan for it. Players who don’t want to spend money for outfits skip two and three events in a row, hoarding their currency, waiting for the right outfit to spend their entire warchest on all for free. On the other hand, if a player wants to pay for an outfit, they know to be prepared to spend bill money for it. Pulling is the same as working a slot machine: you’re not guaranteed to hit. But <em>Infinity Nikki</em> guarantees a high-value piece every 10 pulls. With the currency used for pulls going for a dollar apiece, a nine-piece outfit like Wings of Wishes will run you at least $90. That amount goes up dramatically because the guarantee is for <em>any</em> high-value piece, and Resonance Events often contain <em>multiple</em> high-value outfits that have anywhere between eight and 10 pieces.</p><p>I understand that my problems likely don’t extend to the majority of other players. From perusing the game’s subreddit, I get the feeling most people either already understand the level of preparation required to obtain coveted clothing effectively, don’t mind spending eye-watering sums, or are content to either engage with the system casually or ignore it altogether. I planned on being the latter, someone who tossed the developers a few bucks here and there to obtain the occasional outfit I fancied.</p><div id=":R52rarr6:"><p><figcaption><em>Anyway, these are much better outfits.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And in my naivete, I assumed that’s how gacha games worked. You could either grind out the resources you needed or spend money only when you chose to for items you wanted. Yes, I understood there were elements of random chance to compete against, but I genuinely thought that I could guarantee myself the desired outfits through a mix of casual play and light spending. I will not make that mistake again. Thankfully, the current Lunar New Year event doesn’t have any premium outfits I want. Plus, the ones being given away for free are more than cute enough to soothe my sartorial spirit. </p><p>The real tragedy of all this is that I don’t even like how Wings of Wishes looks. I only wanted it for its special ability to make Nikki’s floating animation look like she’s gliding on a magical paper crane. I have multiple substitutes for the white stockings I’m missing, so I can easily complete the look. But without that final piece, the outfit’s ability won’t trigger, and I don’t like it enough to wear it casually. So it’ll sit, incomplete and unworn, in my wardrobe, possibly forever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Warhorse's medieval muck-o-rama <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> launches today. It's an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra's tendency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gamergator-rhetoric-of-historical-accuracy-has-come-back-to-bite-kingdom-come-on-the-arse">throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-performance-best-settings">a relatively bug-free one</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In the course of my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">51 hours as reviewer</a>, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
My game started to crash frequently following a larger patch before the review embargo, about halfway through my playthrough. The simulation would lock up in the menus, when using the photo mode, and sometimes during exploration. After some trial and error, I deduced that this had to do with my controller cable connection being a little loose. KCD2 does not, in my experience, like it when you appear to be switching rapidly between mouse-and-keyboard and a controller. After switching to a new cable, I was able to make headway without much further trouble.
</p>
<p>
The bug cost me hours of progress not because it wiped or corrupted saves, but because it formed a devil's partnership with Deliverance 2's interestingly fussy, hydra-headed approach to saving. As in the first game, you can checkpoint your progress by drinking an in-game alcoholic beverage, Saviour Schnapps. As Brendy observed to me during edits, it's a fun bit of Ye Olde Meta Commentary that openly positions quicksaving as a vice. 
</p><p>
It's not quite as inconvenient as it sounds: I stumbled on fresh batches of Saviour Schnapps regularly during quests, and you can always brew it yourself from nettles, which grow all over the place, and belladonna, which is found in forest clearings. What's more, apothecaries like the one in Trosky village buy the stuff for decent money, so you can turn a quick profit while stocking up. A single dose of Saviour Schnapps will render you merry (with associated stat buffs) but not absolutely plimsolled, so it shouldn't interfere with your exploits providing you're not the kind to hit F5 at the slightest whiff of peril. 
</p>
<p>
The trouble with Saviour Schnapps is simply that Warhorse try to have their cake and eat it. If the idea is to teach you to weigh the prospect of failure properly, by making quicksaving more of a ritual, this is undercut by the fact that the game <em>does</em> checkpoint after certain quest milestones. As such, it's easy to forget the need to toss back a schnapps now and then. Stir that inconsistency together with a persistent crashing problem, and you have a spicy cocktail I like to call The 11pm Shrieker.
</p>
<p>
Again, this is the only genuinely severe technical problem I've discovered in KCD2. The issue with loose controller connections may have been patched out by the time I read this. Still, you might want to check your USB ports, just in case.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-match-decided-by-coin-flip-after-both-teams-forfeit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Both teams chose to forfeit in the middle of a professional Counter-Strike 2 match, letting the final map and the series itself be determined by a simple coin flip. Why? Because another qualifier scheduled for today has much higher stakes in the Valve Regional Standings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ez-win">‘ez win’</h2>



<p>Earlier today, Ninjas in Pyjamas and Aurora faced off in a best-of-three as part of the CCT Season 2 Europe Series 18 Closed Qualifier. However, both CS2 teams wanted to compete in the BLAST Rising Europe open qualifiers later on, meaning the match would have to end after two maps for both teams to have time. Unfortunately for both NiP and Aurora, they split the first two maps, and with their BLAST Rising qualifier matches starting soon, both teams chose to forfeit.</p>



<p>Following the third map, caster Charlie “Cmd64” Drudge explained that <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378992/aurora-vs-ninjas-in-pyjamas-cct-season-2-europe-series-18-closed-qualifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aurora had forfeited</a> the map due to scheduling. However, the official NiP account on X stated that both teams had actually forfeited, but NiP had won the coin toss.</p>







<p>The decision to skip the rest of the CCT match in favor of the BLAST Rising qualifier actually panned out for NiP. The Ninjas won the Nordic Open Qualifier, earning a guaranteed spot in the closed qualifier that begins tomorrow. Unfortunately for Aurora, they didn’t just lose the coin toss, as they were eliminated in the semifinal of their BLAST Rising open qualifier.</p>



<p>Both teams consider the risk worth the reward. The closed qualifiers for BLAST Rising are events ranked by the Valve Regional Standings, and making it past qualifiers would be very rewarding to a team’s ranking. Format is the big difference maker. The CCT closed qualifier is also ranked, but it uses a group stage format, so one loss won’t immediately eliminate a team like Aurora. However the BLAST Rising open qualifier is a single-elimination bracket, so missing your match would result in instant elimination.</p>



<p>Do you think we’ll see this happen more this year in CS2? Let us know what you think down below or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Unlike other games, it's difficult to put an exact timeframe on just how long it takes to beat a playthrough of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization VII</a>. For starters, the first couple of hours when you begin can be so daunting from a gameplay perspective, so you might spend more time reading the encyclopedia than actually playing. Another huge factor is the various difficulty settings you can apply to your playthrough, which can drastically alter the overall time it takes to get through all three ages in Civ 7.</p><p>Still, we know you have questions about the game's length and we're to give you the best answer we can. So just how long does it take to beat Civ 7?</p><h2>How long it takes to beat Civilization 7</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437801" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437801"></a><figcaption>An end-of-game scene in Civilization VII</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png"></figure><p>The best way to measure how long a playthrough of Civ 7 takes is by counting the number of turns you do across all three ages. While this isn't a full representation of the overall game length, it does provide you with the best tool to measure your progress. And, speaking from experience, I can offer rough time estimates for the amount of turns it takes to beat a playthrough.</p><p>The number of turns it takes to get through all three ages in Civ 7 is entirely dependent on the "Game Speed" you play at. Playing on the fastest speed means it takes fewer turns to complete every age while the slowest speed takes the most turns possible. There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-difficulty-options-and-how-to-change-the-difficulty/1100-6528923/" data-ref-id="1100-6528923">four main game speeds in Civ 7</a> and, from fastest to slowest, they are Quick, Standard, Epic, and Marathon. There's also an "Online" option but that's only for multiplayer.</p><p>If you decide to play on the Standard game speed, every age takes roughly 120-160 turns to complete. The Antiquity Age, which is where the game starts, usually takes the most numbers of turns, as you'll receive more leeway to start up your settlement and get units produced. However, as you move on to the subsequent Exploration and Modern Ages, it takes fewer turns to reach the end of the age. My Antiquity Age on Standard speed took 160 turns while the Exploration Age took 150 and the Modern Age took 120. Of course, your results will vary depending on what kind of path you take.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437800" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437800"></a><figcaption>The Antiquity Age will likely take you the most turns to complete</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png"></figure><p>Overall, <strong>a Standard speed playthrough of Civ 7 took me close to 35 hours to complete</strong>. This included a decent amount of encyclopedia reading and strategy when it came to individual turns, so I didn't speed through the game by any means. However, I also didn't spend minutes upon minutes agonizing over what to build or what leader to target.</p><p>On the flip side, you can expect a Quick speed playthrough to take significantly less time than a Standard speed run. <strong>My first Quick playthrough only lasted around 15 hours</strong>, with each age taking close to five hours and around 100 turns.</p><p>If you want to truly go the distance in Civ 7, playing on either Epic or Marathon speed takes dozens of hours and hundreds of turns per age. I didn't get to finish a playthrough on either speed, but the Antiquity Age ended at 300 turns on Epic and over 400 turns on Marathon. <strong>In all likelihood, you could spend over 100 hours on a single Epic or Marathon run</strong>, especially if you crank the difficulty level up and play on a large map.</p><p>Speaking of which, the map size and difficulty level also play a factor in determining how many turns and hours your playthrough takes. If you play on the smallest map size and the easiest difficulty, you can breeze through a run in 10-20 hours. However, turning everything to the max amplifies how much time you spend in Civ 7 by a significant amount.</p><p>There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.

            <p>
UK game maker Sumo Digital has told staff it will refocus exclusively on "development services for partners", rather than continuing to create its own IP.
</p>
<p>
This decision will "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people," a <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">statement</a> from the company noted today. 
</p>
<p>
"We are committed to minimising this impact as much as possible, exploring all options to retain talent, and supporting those affected with transparency, care and compassion," it added.

<p>
Headquarted in Sheffield, Sumo Digital has grown considerably since its founding in 2003, with development offices in Nottingham, Newcastle, Leamington Spa and Warrington, and also abroad in India. 
</p>
<p>
The company additionally owns several other studios, including the Brighton-based The Chinese Room, developer of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a>.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> announced it had bought parent company Sumo Group in a deal worth around £919m. 
</p>
<p>
Today's news seems set to mark the second round of layoffs at the company in under a year, after 15 percent of its staff were let go in June 2024, and Canadian indie studio Timbre Games was divested. 
</p>
<p>
Sumo Digital has long been a work-for-hire studio that has quietly helped develop some of video gaming's biggest blockbusters, with contributions to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s recent Hitman trilogy, Xbox's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> and 5, Activison's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-vanguard">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a> and Warner Bros' Hogwarts Legacy. 
</p>
<p>
It has also worked on a long list of games as lead developer, including Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing, and LittleBigPlanet 3 and Sackboy: A Big Adventure for PlayStation.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Sumo had begun working on its own IP, including puzzle platformer Snake Pass, and indie titles such as DeathSprint 66 and Critter Cafe that it released through its own publishing label, Secret Mode.
</p>
<p>
Sumo's statement says the company has now been forced to balance "creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business". 
</p>
<p>
The company continued by saying it hoped the decision would strengthen its position as "a premium development partner" going forwards. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether collaborating on new or established games, co-developing games, providing specialist engineering, or porting services; we are confident in our teams' exceptional talent and our ability to thrive in this next chapter," the company concluded.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-howl-nails-the-dark-souls-vibes.1099881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/death-howl-soulslike-dark-souls-deckbuilder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After spending almost two hours with the <em>Death Howl</em> demo, I realized that the most important aspect of any so-called “soulslike” video game is the vibes.</p><p>I have long loathed the descriptor “soulslike” because it so frequently refers to kinds of games I hate to play by comparing them to a series of games that I love: <em>Dark Souls</em> and the other offerings from FromSoftware. Often “soulslike” is meant to call attention to the mechanical similarities between whatever game and <em>Dark Souls</em>—the game may have limited checkpoints, a resource you gain from bosses that is lost upon death, or particularly challenging combat. Rarely do games like that scratch my <em>Dark Souls</em> itch, because what attracts me to those games is not the broad mechanical designations, but the more idiosyncratic design choices paired with a stark, impressionistic approach to storytelling.</p><p><em>Death Howl</em> did actually evoke <em>Dark Souls</em> for me. As a self described “soulslike deckbuilder,” it hits those mechanical signposts—it has bonfires that respawn combat encounters, and you can use the “howls” you earn from enemies to craft more cards—and is atmospheric in a way I long for when I play any game.</p><p>You play as Ro, a mother who has lost her son and is trying to find his soul before he fully departs to the land of the dead. While the demo only shows off one portion of the map, it’s fairly generous. Using a limited color palette and simple but evocative pixel sprites, the game lures you into a richly imagined world inspired by Scandinavian folklore. <em>Death Howl</em> does a lot with a little—sparse but ominous music and the deep red tones that the game is rendered in do a lot of work to evoke a feeling of death and decay. The economy of art and dialogue gave me that <em>Dark Souls</em> feeling of being trapped, out of my depth, in a dying world. Occasionally it even scared the shit out of me. Stumbling upon this part of the map briefly made my heart pound with fear—in motion, the leaves of the trees quiver uncannily, as if they too are watching you trespass into death’s realm.</p><figure></figure><p>As a deckbuilder, the other “soulslike” trademarks are also translated in new ways. As Ro explores the map, she finds grids on the ground where enemies are. As soon as she steps onto the grid, it triggers a turn-based combat encounter. Ro fights these enemies by drawing cards from a deck, representing her attacks. As much as this reminds me of other deck builders like <em>Slay The Spire</em>, there are <em>Souls</em>-esque idiosyncrasies that make it stand apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the way you can’t cancel a combat animation once you press a button in <em>Dark Souls</em>, once you play a card or move Ro on the board in <em>Death Howl</em> you cannot undo it. You have to commit to the decision you made, even if you understand your mistake as soon as you’ve made it. Instead of asking me to play in a way that is mechanically similar to <em>Dark Souls</em>, I feel like I’m playing a game that requires me to think in the same way that I do when I play <em>Dark Souls</em>. Is this the right time for this attack? Do I really want to stand here? Do I have enough health to make the run back between this bonfire and the boss I want to beat? The entirety of the game becomes a puzzle.</p><p><em>Death Howl</em> is available to wishlist on Steam and has a demo. I think I’ll be returning to that demo again—at least until another game comes out that really scratches my <em>Dark Souls</em> itch.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea"><h3>BioWare Is In Big Trouble</h3></a><p>"A lot was riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NEOWIZ and Wolfeye Studios have partnered up to bring players a brand new Retro Sci-fi First-Person Action RPG. NEOWIZ will be responsible for publishing this title and supporting Wolfeye Studios through the development process. So far, the game has yet to be named, but what we do know is that the game will be set in a retrofuturistic setting with a branching narrative, with the game then going on to be distributed globally by NEOWIZ when the time comes.</p>
<p>As a celebration of the partnership news, Wolfeye Studios has released some of their concept art for the upcoming title. There are three images to showcase the world that players will get to explore, from dusty desert towns to built-up elegant interiors. The images chosen are being used to show how diverse the world will be, combining rugged environments with futuristic style to create a unique experience for the audience.</p>

<p>The team leaders of Wolfeye Studios are Raf Colantonio and Julien Roby, who have worked on Dishonored and Prey. They are also joined by industry veterans who worked with them on those two titles, as well as some of the developers working on Dark Messiah, Pentiment, and Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Wolfeye Studios is now working hard to create this RPG title, with it set to be released on PC and console. <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The team</a> at Wolfeye Studios works from more than 10 different cities around the world, working across seven different time zones on four different continents. In 2022, Wolfeye Studios released its first game, "Weird West," which went on to be nominated for BEST RPG of the Year at the annual D.I.C.E. Awards.</p>
<p>"We have a burning passion for making a very specific type of game that blends RPG, action and simulation. These games can only be successful when the publisher shares that same passion," says Raf Colantonio, Creative Director and President of Wolfeye Studios.</p>
<p>NEOWIZ has helped publish some very well-known titles over the years, with the most recent being the award-winning title <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">Lies of P</a>. Lies of P is set to get a DLC sometime this year. This company has most recently announced a partnership with ZAKAZANE, a studio that consists of CD Projekt Red and 11 Bit Studios alumni.</p>
<p>While the details about the developer's upcoming title are slim, you can check out the concept art above for a glimpse into what you can expect in the future.</p>
