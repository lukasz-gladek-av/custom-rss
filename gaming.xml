            <p>Ever since the hat was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tf2s-classless-udpate-hats-maps">invented by Valve Corporation in 2009</a>, mankind has grappled with questions of fairness, worthiness, and pride – at least as they pertain to microtransations in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> games. Shooty battle royale  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a> is the latest to posit an answer, that being "the Battle Pass should cost more money".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">post</a> detailing BP-specific changes to expect in Apex’s upcoming Season 22, publishers EA announced that the Premium Battle Pass will, from Season 22 onward, only be sold for $10 in real-world cash – a major change from previous passes, that were buyable with in-game currency that could be earned through play. There’ll also be two separate Premium Battle Passes per season, taking the total cost per-season to $20. Cue outrage, the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/apex_legends_battle_pass_updates_season_22/">subreddit</a> filling in minutes with players announcing their immediate uninstall.</p>
<p>In fairness to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgusted_of_Tunbridge_Wells">Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells</a> crowd, this change could represent a major price hike for regular players when Season 22 launches on August 6th. Previous Premium Battle Passes cost 950 Apex Coins, the aforementioned in-game currency, but by progressing through the pass’s tiers, you could eventually earn that amount back in rewards. Which could then be spent on the next season’s Battle Pass, and so on, potentially daisy-chaining BP purchases without ever needing to buy a fresh pile of Apex Coins with real money.</p>
<p>Now that the Premium Battle Pass is going cash-only, that self-funding cycling is broken, and what replaces it ain’t cheap. At $10 a pop, with two per season and usually four seasons in a year, that’s an annual cost of $80 – just four bucks shy of a standard Netflix sub. For skins and taunts. Yeesh.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, EA’s post argues that the new system will in fact "up the value" for players. While each individual Premium Battle Pass will only have 60 levels apiece, down from 110, when completed they’ll fork over more crafting materials and Apex Pack loot crates than previous passes did. And since there’ll be twice as many passes per season, one per 'split' (basically each half of the season), the total per-season haul of potential unlocks is effectively doubled. In the first two weeks of season 22, there’ll also be the one-off chance to unlock the first split’s Premium Battle Pass rewards for free, by completing "a set of challenges".</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/apex-legends-aerith-skin.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA/Respawn Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That’s cool and all – more crafting materials is a good way to gain the specific unlockables you want, offsetting the randomness of Apex Packs – but even as someone whose interest in Apex Legends was only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-season-20s-skill-trees-see-the-battle-royale-take-a-surprising-moba-turn">recently rekindled</a>, I wouldn’t pay ten quid for even twice as many cosmetics. Not when I’ve spent the past five years getting Battle Passes who what felt like nada.</p>
<p>Such reticence has, it must be said, likely been calculated by EA. Like January’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-crossover-arrives-on-january-9th">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth crossover</a> event, and its $360 deathbox skin, this whole thing smacks of an appeal to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460321000368">whales</a> – dedicated big spenders who’ll pay up regardless. Meanwhile, more numerous but also more frugal players are considered acceptable losses. Which from a purely business-y standpoint, is a logical enough plan for F2P games that are already facing a dwindling playerbase.</p>
<p>From a player standpoint, though... hmmmmm. We can get as snooty as we want about the cosmetic-based concept of Battle Passes, but it’s a fact that they incentivise play, through the simple pleasures of seeing a level counter tick up as much as the desire for the cosmetics themselves. Erecting a higher paywall for them can and will remove this source of progression, and with it, the ability to feel like you’re getting wins even when you’re eating shit in the actual arena. That’s surely not good for Apex Legends’ health, even if it does prove good for its coffers.</p>

            <p>Video game hardware spending in the US was down 40 percent in May compared to 2023, numbers company Circana reports.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S sales all saw "double-digit percentage declines year-on-year" comparing figures up to May, "with Switch showing the most significant drop", according to the company's boss and industry analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 was the top selling console in units and dollar sales in May. The console's unit sales lead those of PlayStation 4 by eight percent.</p>

<p>The decline wasn't just for hardware sales. Spending on game "content" - ie. games and in-game currency and items - also fell three percent compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, spending on gaming accessories also dropped eight percent compared to last year. PlayStation Portal was the best selling accessory in May. </p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was the best selling game in the US for May. Previously a PlayStation console exclusive, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-ghost-of-tsushima-on-pc-is-another-excellent-nixxes-port">PC port launched</a>, and quickly became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-is-playstations-fourth-biggest-pc-launch-to-date">PlayStation's biggest single-player PC launch in terms of concurrent players</a>.</p>
<p>Fortnite has maintained its popularity, with the free-to-play game boasting the highest number of active users across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in May. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/70-of-developers-concerned-about-sustainability-of-live-service-games-new-study-suggests">recent study highlighted the prevalence of free-to-play games and their sustainability</a>, with these new sales figures proving their continued popularity above new full releases.</p>
<p>"Projected US total spending on video game hardware, content and accessories fell six percent in May 2024 when compared to a year ago," Piscatella said.
</p>
<p>According to Piscatella, this yearly decline can be attributed - at least in part - to last year's arrival of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, released on Nintendo Switch in May 2023.</p> <div>

<p>Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft are all set to launch new hardware in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">Microsoft revealed three new Xbox console variants</a> with increased storage capacity, which will be available at the end of the year in select markets. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">Sony is also reportedly planning to release a PS5 'Pro' console</a>, which will run games at 60fps with ray-tracing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has said it will announce the Switch's successor - dubbed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">later this financial year</a>, before March 31st 2025. It's expected to be actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">released at some point in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Each platform has a number of bigger video game releases still to come this year, as well, with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-finally-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom arriving on Switch</a> this September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot coming to PS5 also in September</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indy-heads-to-the-himalayas-in-new-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-teaser">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle slated for a 2024 debut</a> on Xbox and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-kakarot-next-dlc-name-discovered-in-game%E2%80%99s-latest-update.922374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-kakarot-next-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The name of the next Dragon Ball Kakarot DLC has been discovered in the game files, revealing how it will be based on the next iteration of the franchise.</p>
<p>As reported by Josou Kitsune on<a href="https://x.com/Josou_Kit/status/1810164580615590381" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> X/Twitter</a>, the game's latest update, which introduced a new side quest, includes in its files references to its next DLC expansion. Unlike what most expected, the next expansion won't be based on Dragon Ball GT or Dragon Ball Super, but on Dragon Ball Daima, a new anime series, and Akira Toriyama's last work, which is set to release this Fall.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball Kakarot proved to be rather successful on the market, so much so that Bandai Namco decided to continue supporting the game well past its first round of DLC expansions. Even without additional content, the game is well worth the time of any fan of the series, despite some issues, as it is an accurate recreation of the Dragon Ball Z story, as we highlighted in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-authentic-ambitious-adequate/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a mixed bag. If you're a Dragon Ball fan, this game will offer so many nice moments and make you occasionally beam from ear to ear. But then during exploration and combat, things quickly become tedious. At full price, it's hard to recommend this game, but when it becomes affordable in a sale, it'll be hard for fans to resist.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Ball Kakarot is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Hard mode on these Infiltration Operations offers an improved drop chance for certain loot, which means players are inclined to play them on hard rather than normal difficulty.

The news has certainly gone down well with fans who have praised the developer for acting quickly on feedback. “Kudos to the dev team, brilliant decision,” said redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1dyqxfh/comment/lcas3ic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sufficient_Theory534</a>. “This will increase the longevity of the game exponentially.”</p><p>While Nexon is adding this much-requested feature, it has remained quiet on a number of controversies that have hit The First Descendant since it came out. For example, the company has yet to address <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-enjoys-big-player-numbers-on-steam-despite-microtransaction-hell">The First Descendant’s ultra aggressive monetization</a>, nor has it explained <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story">the remarkable similarities between icons used in The First Descendant and Bungie’s rival looter shooter, Destiny</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>Still, The First Descendant is pulling in players, with a peak Steam concurrent player count of 264,860 so far — enough to break into the top five most-played games on Valve’s platform.

            <p>
An impressive new mod for The Witcher 3 lets players customise their own character and even wield magic as a sorceress.
</p>
<p>
Modder nikich340 has been working on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940">Custom Player Characters mod</a> for two-and-a-half years and it's now available on NexusMods (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-3-mod-lets-you-play-as-fully-customizable-witcher-or-sorceress-with-new-magic-combat-system">IGN</a>).

</p>
<p>
The mod allows players to create a custom character instead of protagonist Geralt, choosing between a Witcher, a Witcheress, and even a Sorceress with a new magic combat system and questline.

<p>

While it's not a full character creator in the traditional sense, the mod essentially takes body elements from all NPCs and allows players to mix and match to style their own character.
</p>
<p>
Players can then choose between three classes. The Witcher will play the same as Geralt, while the Witcheress is the same but with a female character. So yes, you could re-skin the character as Ciri for the entire game, or a more custom character.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most interesting, though, is the Sorceress class, which not only includes a brand new magic combat system but a unique questline to unlock skills. Yes, that means you can finally play through The Witcher 3 as Yennefer (or Triss, if you really must).
</p>
<p>
Oh, and on top of blasting enemies with lightning, you can transform into a cat!
</p>
<p>
Animations have been tweaked for female characters, plus - through a separate mod - female voice lines can be added in.
</p>
<p>
In short, it's a very cool mod that will satisfy wish fulfilment for some players looking for a Geralt alternative. You can see it all in action in the video below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/apex-legends-season-22-is-doubling-up-on-paid-battle-passes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> Season 22 is bringing big changes to how battle passes and rewards are doled out to players, with developer Respawn Entertainment announcing that each season will now have two shorter battle passes in place of one, and that they’re removing the ability to use the premium in-game currency to buy them. As you’d expect, the community is in uproar over the effective price hike to premium battle passes for the free-to-play shooter.</p>
<p>From Season 22 in August, Apex Legends will now have two half-season battle passes, one of which will be available at the start of the season and the second then at the season’s “split” in the middle. Each will have 60 levels of rewards for a total of 120, which is an increase to the previous system’s 110 rewards, and will mean that there’s a reduced grind to reach the end-tier rewards and the most special skins.</p>


<p>However, this comes at a cost. There will still be a free battle pass reward track, but each half-season premium battle pass will cost $9.99 USD in real currency, effectively doubling the price where a premium battle pass previously cost 950 Apex Coins. Those were available as part of a 1000 coin bundle priced at $9.99 USD, or could be earned through playing and completing a previous battle pass, making it a reward for your continued engagement and keeping the servers stocked with players.</p>
<p>In addition to a standard premium pass, the new ‘Premium+’ tier will replace the existing ‘Premium Bundle’. This costs $19.99, has 10 level skips and double the Exotic Shards, as well as special Premium+ character skin variants and grants access to all characters through a battle pass’s duration. Over the course of a full season that works out to $40 compared to 2800 Apex Coins (coin bundles available in 2150 for $20 or 4350 for $40), though Respawn are saying that “The decision to move from AC to real-world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.”</p>
<p>Yes, a “decrease”.</p>

<p>One element that’s not clear is how long battle passes will be available for. Will the first pass of a season expire at the “split”, or be valid through to the end of a season? Each pass has roughly half the rewards, but there’s also potentially half the amount of time in which to complete them, which will mean there’s still that&nbsp;fear of missing out (FOMO) and grinding to reach the final tier rewards.</p>
<p>This has obviously gone down like a lead balloon with the fanbase, in large part for effectively doubling the cost, but it has also called into question how healthy Apex Legends is as a game, if EA is resorting to this kind of tactic. It’s equivalent to how Netflix, Disney+ or PS Plus have increased price over time, as their ability to draw in new subscribers has tapered off, as a way to boost quarterly revenues. EA will be gambling that having more battle passes will mean that devout players will spend more, making up for any players that are pushed away from spending or playing by this decision.</p>
<p>There’s another side to this, though, which is that having more shorter battle passes in general (free and paid) shortens the cadence of play and engagement that seasonal structures have. Instead of having that big refresh every 3 months, it’s now ever 1.5 months, which they will hope will help to even out the peaks and troughs that they might currently be seeing.</p>

            <p>
Chinese and Russian Pokémon Go players have reported a brief window of regular gameplay this week - despite long-standing geo-blocking that typically makes the game inaccessible across most of these regions. 
</p>
<p>
Reports collated on top Pokémon Go reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1dxy6x6/pogo_in_mainland_china_so_pogo_got_ungeoblocked/">TheSilphRoad</a> show players able to send in-game postcards from Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 student protest and massacre now subject to strict censorship by the country's government. 
</p>
<p>
For years, Pokémon Go has been unplayable in large swathes of China - and various tourists have recorded their experiences trying to load the smartphone game when visiting. No Pokémon will appear to catch, and no locations will appear on the map.
</p>
<p>
This changed, briefly, on Sunday evening, as an apparent glitch brought the game back to life across the country. 
</p>
<p>
In Russia, where developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-suspend-gameplay-in-russia-belarus">Niantic suspended Pokémon Go gameplay in March 2022</a>, the same glitch saw gameplay return there too. 
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, in-game locations remain in Niantic's database for both of these countries - although it seems unlikely either will return normally any time soon. 
</p>
<p>
"We stand with the global community in hoping for peace and a rapid resolution to the violence and suffering in Ukraine," developer Niantic wrote in a statement published via X in 2022.
</p>
<p>
"Niantic's games are no longer available for download in Russia and Belarus, and gameplay will also be suspended there shortly."
</p>
<p>
Niantic declined to comment on Sunday's brief window of gameplay when contacted by Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-to-be-adding-fuse-mechanic-as-necrozma-confirmed-for-go-fest">Pokémon Go's biggest event of the year, Go Fest 2024</a>, is scheduled for this weekend - with the general release of Mythical Pokémon Marshadow one of its rewards. Beyond that, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-set-to-add-gen-8s-dynamax-mechanic">game looks set to finally go big on Pokémon's eighth generation of monsters</a>, including the likely arrival of Dynamax.</p>

            <p>The studio-killing fallout of Embracer's acquisition frenzy continues to fall like ash on the industry. The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risen">Risen</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elex">Elex</a>, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-zamkniete-to-koniec-tworcow-gothica">CD-Action</a>. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">purgatorial studio massacre</a>. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piranha-bytes-devs-of-gothic-and-elex-are-next-on-embracers-chopping-block">"don't write us off yet!"</a> Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The former head of Piranha Bytes, Björn Pankratz, confirmed the news on a Discord server for Pithead Studio, a newly established games company co-founded with his wife, Jenny Pankratz.</p>
<p>"As you sure noticed, the gaming industry was not doing well last year," says a message in the Discord,  as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/embracer-has-reportedly-closed-elex-developer-piranha-bytes-as-former-creative-director-announces-a-new-indie-studio/">PC Gamer</a>. "This was also the case for the Embracer Group, to which THQ Nordic and Piranha Bytes belong. A lot of studios had to close, thousands of people in the gaming industry worldwide lost their jobs. Sadly, Piranha Bytes was also affected by this."</p>
<p>Images in the CD-Action report also show the <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cdaction.pl%2Fimages%2F2024%2F07%2F08%2F47e10678-9580-460e-8a37-46151afd5289.jpeg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75">Piranha Bytes offices</a> in a state of relative abandonment, with unused desks, chairs and lamps piled up in a room. </p>
<p>The RPGs of Piranha Bytes were known for being somewhat janky but spirited. Gothic was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gothic-retrospective">more believable than modern RPGs</a>, according to Sin. The Risen games had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risen-2-review">"heart and soul"</a> even if they were sometimes wobbly, said Alec once upon a time. And although Elex II was not Alice B's cup of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elex-ii-prevew-a-weird-science-fantasy-rpg-that-doesnt-care-about-you-at-all">sci-fi lizard battering</a>, she could still clearly see why people would gel with it. </p>
<p>As brands, Gothic, Risen and Elex still belong to publisher THQ Nordic (owned by Embracer), according to another message on the Pithead Studio Discord. But it's hard for even those who spent their lives working on these games to know whether the franchises will continue in any meaningful way in the future.</p>
<p>"All we know is that Alkimia Interactive from [Spain] is working on [a] Gothic Remake," say Pithead. "We are not included in the making of the remake in any form, and therefore have no influence on it."</p>
<p>The closures brought about by Embracer have greatly impacted the industry, putting a huge number of people out of work, and killing dead a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">potential Red Faction sequel</a>. They say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">their "restructuring programme" is over</a>.</p>

            <p>I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of "dark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>" or "horror strategy" games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fabulous-fear-machine-out-today-is-a-strategy-game-of-engrossing-evil">The Fabulous Fear Machine</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-now-in-early-access-the-tribe-must-survive-is-frostpunk-for-people-who-love-being-afraid-of-the-dark">The Tribe Must Survive</a>, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonmilk">moonmilk</a> rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.</p><!--more-->

<p>Anoxia Station is set in 1988, but not the 1988 you may remember. The Earth's surface has been devastated by a supervolcano and, in a shocking display of wildcard speculative world-building, humanity is now dependent on petroleum for survival. You take charge of a group of Terranauts, sent into the guts of a festering world in search of a fabled ocean of oil. You'll excavate a path to this mega-deposit, sector by sector. Along the way, you'll need to extract smaller pockets of oil for the benefit of the world above, expand your mining facilities and keep your (irreplaceable) crew alive, sane and at peace with each other. </p>
<p>This is easier said than done, because this is 1988, the height of the Cold War, and your miners hail from different sides of various Iron Curtains - there are people from the Soviet Union, the United States, the German Democratic Republic and Japan, among others. Some are enemies within who have hidden agendas, others just hate each other instinctively. You'll have to look after all of them, regardless. "Crewmen might become despicable, but if they fall, entire production lines might be extinguished, spelling hardship, if not death for the whole mission," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia_Station/">the Steam page</a>. Sounds challenging! And that's before we start talking about those massive insectile lifeforms, which look like they've wriggled out of the catacombs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>. The Steam page trails off ominously here.</p>
<p>Anoxia Station has "a uniquely isometric style grounded in real physical processes", with audio design that consists of "a mix of the deafening roars of shifting rock, the harsh sounds of mining and welding, the distant clicking of something clearly inhuman, and a familiar scream". It's the work of Yakov Butuzoff, whose other works include visual novel Loretta, with Abylight Studios publishing. There's no release date yet.</p>

Twitch streamer MissMikkaa has completed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree with a dance mat controller.
</p>
<p>
Fans of the streamer won't be surprised by this news, after Mikkaa previously not only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-dancing-through-elden-ring-with-a-dance-pad">completed the base game on a customised dance mat</a>, but played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-defeats-elden-rings-malenia-in-dance-pad-and-controller-simultaneous-challenge-run">two games simultaneously on dance mat and controller</a>.

</p>
<p>
Of course, the release of Shadow of the Erdtree means she's back at it. And, after a week of dancing, she's completed the DLC. There's a video of the feat below so <strong>spoiler warning</strong>.

"I did it! ALL bosses of my dance pad Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree run have been deFEETed!" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.
</p>
<p>
"The last boss fell after 52 tries and 7 hours of dance-padding (my feet hurt). DLC took me 7 days in total with 325 deaths; 69 of them to gravity, nice. I hope Miyazaki is proud of me."
</p>
<p>
A video alongside the post shows the streamer defeating the final boss, so <strong> final spoiler warning</strong>. "I'm so tired," she says at the end, collapsing to the ground. I'm not surprised.
</p>
<p>And when so many players are debating whether the DLC is too difficult, here's a streamer finishing perhaps the ultimate challenge. A true expert!</p> <div>

As we previously reported, the release of Shadow of the Erdtree has meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamers-continue-to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-weird-and-wonderful-ways">the return of streamers playing the game in weird ways</a>. That includes Perrikaryal who's playing through the game with mind control - she's now defeated Messmer, which is hugely impressive.

			<p>A fan recently created a Fallout Unreal Engine 5 prototype, providing a glimpse at what possibilities the future holds for the popular series by Bethesda.</p>
<p>The prototype, which was made by Milwaukee Games, takes advantage of the latest version of the game engine by Epic to recreate the atmosphere the series is known for. The moment the Vault opens, in particular, looks great, as do the open wasteland and the recreation of the iconic Pip-Boy.</p>
<p><iframe title="I Made a Fallout Prototype in Unreal Engine 5 (Gameplay)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQK1VjUL3l4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been a while since the release of Fallout 4, so this Fallout Unreal Engine 5 is definitely making us hunger for another proper new entry in the series even more. A statement from Xbox head Phil Spencer suggested the success of the Amazon Prime Video TV Show may have <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">sped up plans for a new game</a>, but Todd Howard later confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-games-wont-be-rushed-says-howard-bethesda-game-studios-had-25-million-players-last-month/">new entries in the series won't be rushed out</a> just to take advantage of the franchise's current popularity.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Fallout 76, now available on PC and console. The game is currently available for a very low price as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Summer Sale</a>, so there's no better time than now to join the many Vault Dwellers roaming post-nuclear America and experience the largest and most dynamic world created for the franchise.</p>

			<p>The launch of Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III on PlayStation means that for the first time in many, many years, all three Bubble Bobble games are available on one platform. Both <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP8908-CUSA46390_00-HAMPRDC000000001">Rainbow Islands</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP8908-CUSA03943_00-HAMPRDC000000001">Bubble Bobble</a> were released as part of the Arcade Archives series, direct ports of the arcade games, but Parasol Stars has had a few extra tweaks thanks to developers ININ and this one is actually published by the original arcade machine manufacture, Taito.</p>
<p><iframe title="Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III Launch Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHhXUfVmwD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game – also confusing known as Rainbow Islands II even though there are no rainbows – features the same elements as the previous two instalments but with an added twist. The basic gameplay is still the same, with mostly single screen levels that have a bunch of enemies moving in fairly predictable paths, where one touch from any of them will cause you to lose a life. The twist here is that Bub and Bob (still in human form) have parasols which they can use&nbsp; in a number of ways.</p>


<p>Get close to an enemy and flourish you parasol and you can stun the creature, pick it up and throw at other enemies. You can also use the parasol to block incoming attacks, and collect bubbles that drop from the ceiling. Throw a single bubble and it will knock out an enemy, but collect five and it will turn into a super weapon – either a pool of fire, an electric bolt, or a torrent of water – which you can use to knock out multiple bad guys at once.</p>


<p>Like all the Bubble Bobble games the premise is quite simple, and unlike it’s predecessors, Parasol Stars is actually much easier and you can breeze through the first couple of levels without much thought. However, thinking is exactly what you need to do if you want to score the big points.&nbsp; Hitting multiple enemies at once brings showers of point giving fruit, and there many secrets hidden in the levels, just throwing a bubble in a certain direction may produce enough ice creams and eclairs to keep anyone happy. As the enemies always start in the same position and you have just a brief second before they start moving, the key is to work out the best path through the level, hitting as many enemies at once and uncovering all the delicious goodies.</p>
<p>At the end of each of the eight levels you will face a boss fight and the mechanics change. Now you can spawn bubbles by floating around, charge up a super burst and hit the boss. There are also two hidden bonus levels that can be unlocked… if you know how.</p>

<p>As mentioned this isn’t a direct port of the arcade game, and while the core game is exactly the same ININ have tweaked a few things. The control scheme has been modified for our modern controllers and I have to say it works like a dream, so much better than the controls from the previous games. The graphics, while still in the 16-bit pixel glory, are superbly crisp and colourful and make Rainbow Islands look rather washed out in comparison. The colours also help make the game look a lot less dated; it could be an indie game from 2024.</p>
<p>The game also has the usual modern features including a rewind button, load and saves, and filters. There’s also options for those who are colour blind and a hilarious if totally useless feature to change the screen size to the original GameBoy version, which results in the game running in a 3cm square in the middle of a 4K screen.</p>
<p>The jewel in the crown is the two player mode, as unlike the previous games you can work together, or be a dick. Do you help the second player, giving them a boost up on your brolly and working together to clear the screen, or do you hide on your side and throw enemies at your pal, stunning them so they can’t move and get smacked in the face by a sentient trombone?</p>

		
		

<p>So the big question, is as good as the the other two games? Well yes and no. It’s still a brilliant game but perhaps lacks the “one more go” factor of Rainbow Islands, but if you have two players then this is by far the best in the series.</p>

			<p>Starting yesterday, the newly released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MVCQJBJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox app</a> for the Amazon Fire TV stick allows users to play Xbox games on the go, even without the console. Of course, you will need an active Game Pass Ultimate subscription, as that's the only way to access cloud gaming for Xbox - unless all you want to play is Fortnite, which can be checked out for free.</p>
<p>The app is initially available on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3LBrJ7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fire TV 4K Max (2023)</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3VWvQ2D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fire TV Stick 4K (2023)</a>, with pricing starting at $49.99. A Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller, such as Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, PlayStation DualSense, or DualShock 4, is also needed to play.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Xbox? Have no fear with Amazon Fire TV Stick" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xiVHc3UBJFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the occasion, Microsoft also released a dedicated ad where the phrase 'you don't need an Xbox to play Xbox' can be heard - something that would have been unthinkable mere years ago. Of course, it is no news that Microsoft is pushing beyond the limited confines of the console space. Partly, that is because sales aren't great (in fact, <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have been declining for a while now</a>), but it's also because Microsoft's ambitions are much bigger than the total addressable market for consoles could ever allow. There are only a few hundred million users interested in console gaming, whereas Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/nadella-xbox-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to reach up to three billion gamers</a> wherever they may wish to play.</p>
<p>That includes PC gaming (all Xbox first-party titles have launched on PC for several years now), other consoles (as we've seen with the ports of Sea of Thieves, Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush to PlayStation 5/Nintendo Switch), TVs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-samsung-partnership-brings-xbox-app-to-samsung-gaming-hub-on-2022-smart-tvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there's been an app on Samsung televisions</a> for two years now), and mobile devices, the real deal, with Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready to launch a dedicated store later this month</a>. The Amazon Fire TV stick app is just a stepping stone on a path to bring Xbox games to every possible device.</p>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1810470552731095545?t=VNOHCe8Wbww2sHiGT0Ge7w&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Spanish leaker extas1s</a>, Deck13's action RPG Atlas Fallen is coming soon to Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service. The leaker did not specify any specific date, but chances are it will happen alongside the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big free Reign of Sand update</a>, scheduled for August 6.</p>
<p>Atlas Fallen launched in August 2023 to slightly mixed reviews. The game earned a 7 out of 10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-god-of-sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Before release, Atlas Fallen looked like an intense action game that could rival the best titles released in the past few years. The execution, however, relegates Deck13's latest game to be nothing more than a decent title that can be fun if one is willing to look past its shortcomings. With a little more polish, the game could have been great, but in its current state, it will eventually become a faint memory like the world that was covered in sand by the God Thelos.</em></p>
<p>Deck13 is known mostly for its Soulslike games (the first Lords of the Fallen and the two The Surge titles). With Atlas Fallen, they tried to switch genres, but they didn't find commercial success, either, as publisher Focus Home Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-was-a-financial-disappointment-but-an-enhanced-version-and-new-content-is-coming-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in December 2023.</p>
<p>However, they set on trying to improve the game. The Reign of Sand update will introduce some brand new voice acting by the award-winning actor Ben Starr (who voiced Clive Rosfield, the protagonist in Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI), a new area, new enemies, 25 new Essence Stones, new progression mechanics, quality of life improvements (mostly to the camera, but also to balancing and onboarding), the highly requested New Game Plus mode, and a new difficulty mode called Nyaal's Nightmare.</p>
<p>It only makes sense to ensure as many people as possible check out this improved version of Atlas Fallen through Game Pass. After all, as KeokeN's Koen Deetman <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-us-home-qa-keoken-talks-studio-layoffs-kickstarter-campaign-and-life-as-a-small-indie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Wccftech in our fresh Deliver Us Home interview</a>, Game Pass is a great discovery tool that is sure to boost a game's visibility for a while.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on the official announcement, which will probably happen soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/console-us-spending-declines-ghost-of-tsushima-resurgence-validates-sonys-pc-strategy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810377988434964526">Hardware spending in the US declined by 40%</a> in May on a year-on-year comparison, according to Circana (formerly NPD). This includes popular consoles such as the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. The main culprit is the tough comparison with May 2023, which saw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, a masterpiece and massive commercial success for Nintendo that drove lots of sales of Switch hardware.</p>
<p>This May, Sony's PlayStation comes out on top. Ghost of Tsushima was the best-seller in May 2024, surging back from rank #71 in the chart thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful release on PC</a>. During this time, Nintendo also saw the release of the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake. However, Sony remained on top with better sales in physical and digital media from Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Also, Helldivers 2 was a massive release for Sony, and it can be played only on PC or PlayStation 5. The large number of sales accrued with these two games shows that Sony's strategy of bringing its exclusives to PC is incredibly successful, being able to tap into a whole new market.</p>
<p>As the years go by, we see more and more PlayStation exclusives, such as The Last of Us, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn, and many more, be ported to PC. As this happens, Sony's sales skyrocket as it adds a new layer of accessibility to the game for fans who may not be able to afford a PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Circana also notes that May 2024 saw a 3% dip in all content spending, compared to a 13% growth in mobile content spending. As more games are put on mobile (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-7-biohazard-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-july/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAPCOM's Resident Evil series</a>), new audiences can discover them, and they can usually get them for cheaper than they may get on another console.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch is seeing the biggest drop in sales, which could be related to the upcoming announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Many players avoid buying a new Nintendo Switch because they don't want to have outdated technology, and a new era of future games could be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. Then again, most users who wanted a Switch probably already have one by now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194631/logitech-g309-gaming-mouse-powerplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I haven’t thought about charging my Logitech wireless gaming mouse in two and a half years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay">because I have a magic mousepad</a> that does it automatically. But Logitech mice that work with the Powerplay mousepad are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">expensive</a>, heavy, or both, and none of them double as a Bluetooth mouse so I can wirelessly pair them to my laptop, handheld, or phone.</p><p>Today, Logitech is changing that with <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us">the Logitech G309</a>, an $80 mouse that almost does it all. It’s the first Powerplay mouse this inexpensive, the first with Bluetooth, the first that lets you use a AA battery when you’re on the go — and the first Logitech wireless mouse with a supercapacitor inside so you don’t <em>necessarily</em> need a battery at all. </p><p>Even without Powerplay, the G309 is a dual-mode wireless gaming mouse that promises up to 300 hours of battery life using its Lightspeed wireless dongle, or up to 600 hours over Bluetooth, while you’re slinging around its 86-gram frame. </p><p>But if you’ve got that $120 Powerplay pad, you can remove the AA battery to reach a total mouse weight of <em>just 68 grams</em>, nearly as light as the 60-gram, $160 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2<em> </em>that gave me serious mouse envy</a> last year. It’s possible because the supercapacitor acts as a tiny battery constantly being wirelessly charged by the Powerplay mousepad underneath. “It’s never going to die at all; it’s endless battery life,” promises Logitech senior global product manager Nicolas Métral.</p><p>It’s not the first wireless gaming mouse to test the waters with a supercapacitor — but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16867292/razer-wireless-charging-hyperflux-mamba-firefly-mouse-pad-ces-2018">when Mad Catz and Razer tried that in 2018</a>, those pricey wireless power mice didn’t have any <em>other</em> way to charge. You had to use them on their bundled pad or with a wired cord. Until now, Logitech’s used internal rechargeable lithium cells to let you make its Powerplay mice somewhat portable; here, a AA battery picks up the slack. </p><p>Despite being on the budget end of Logitech’s gaming mice, the G309 also has the same Hero 25K sensor and hybrid optomechanical switches the company’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23328970/logitech-g502-x-lightspeed-plus-gaming-mouse-mice-optical-buttons-usb-c">shipping in premium mice for a while</a>, both of which might be welcome upgrades over the $60 G305 mouse it’s based upon. </p><p>But it’s still missing the one Logitech mouse feature I’d have a hard time doing without — the company’s dual-mode ratcheting/free spinning scroll wheel that I’m constantly using to zip through documents and webpages when I’m using my gaming mouse for work. Among gaming mice, that’s still exclusive to its G502 and G903 from what I can tell. </p><p>And, it’s a bit of a shame Logitech still sells its Powerplay mousepad for $120 with only the rarest and smallest of discounts. If the company really wants to fulfill the G309’s promise of “Wireless Play for All” — that’s Logitech’s tagline — I’d recommend making the complete package more affordable.</p><p>Logitech says it will keep selling the G305 alongside the G309. The G309 can also share a single Lightspeed wireless dongle with a bunch of Logitech’s wireless keyboards, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185020/logitech-keyboard-mx-keycaps-gaming">the new G515 TKL</a>, G715, G915, G915 TKL, Pro X 60, and Pro X TKL.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This title was released for the PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC.&nbsp; As you can imagine, fans have been hoping for a new game in the series following the release of the 2019's Toy Story 4 movie. We've included a part of the official Toy Story 3: The Video Game press release from 2010 below.</p>
<p>"“Toy Story 3: The Video Game addresses a fact understood by every kid: imagination is what truly brings toys to life,” said John Blackburn, vice president and general manager of Avalanche Software. “That’s really what a toy box is about. We remember that kind of play from our own childhood, and it’s where we began as game designers. With this title, we want to encourage and reward creativity in others.”</p>
<p>“With Toy Story 3: The Video Game, audiences will have multiple ways to experience and enjoy the Toy Story world,” said Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global marketing, Disney Interactive Studios. “Story Mode follows the film’s story and adventures, while Toy Box Mode gets to the playful heart of the Toy Story franchise. By combining the power of imagination with the Toy Story universe, the game appeals to the joy of play in all of us.”</p>

<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was released on May 21 following years of teasers and trailers. It was first announced in 2018 and was penned as being one of the most visually advanced games ever made – and to give the game credit, it hits that target just fine. However, it’s a testament to the fact that visuals aren’t everything, as recent sales data has revealed that the game performed terribly during May 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sacrificing-senua">Sacrificing Senua</h2>



<p>Hellblade II is a fairly short game that offers an immersive, impactful story mixed up with groundbreaking visuals, and it performed fairly well in reviews when it was released. Presently, it sits on Metacritic with a score of 80, which isn’t awful.</p>



<p>However, US sales data published by Circana has revealed how poorly Hellblade II performed when it was released, with the game coming in 37th place overall in the charts for full-game dollar sales. On Xbox, it ended up in 21st place. In terms of player count, it fell behind the likes of Fallout 76, and on Steam, it peaked at just 3,892 players. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">European sales charts</a>, it was revealed that Hellblade II failed to break into the top 100 games in May. On streaming platforms, Hellblade II crashed pretty quickly. It reached a peak of 110,193 viewers on Twitch on launch day, but by the second day on the market, that number had dwindled by 90%, and by the following week, a peak of just 900 users was recorded. </p>



<p>It’s hardly a flash in the pan, but it’s a short-lived, short-form game that only offers a few hours of entertainment, and once you’re done, you’re <strong>done</strong>. </p>

<p>Earlier this week, images emerged online showing popular streamer, Kylie ‘Sketch’ Cox, performing explicit acts – and it was alleged that the images were screengrabbed from an old OnlyFans account. The surfacing of the images led to Sketch being bombarded on social media with homophobic abuse, prompting many of his peers to speak up in support of him amid an unplanned outing. </p>



<p>He went live just hours ago with an explanation that led to him confirming that the images are real and that they were taken from a ‘dark time’ in his life and he has since ‘changed’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-move-on">We Move On</h2>



<p>Sketch might not be everyone’s cup of tea and he’s one of the more zany characters on Twitch, but there’s no discrediting the rampant growth that the streamer has experienced in the last few months. In March 2024, he blew up, amassing more than 350,000 followers in a single month, and he now sits at 1.1 million followers on the top-tier streaming platform.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, images appeared on social media showing Sketch engaged in a sexual act with another man, which prompted an ignorant portion of the gaming community to unleash a tirade upon him. He was dragged through the wringer, and during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2192642945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an emotional appearance on stream</a> last night, he revealed that the revelation hitting the air almost ended him:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it came out. And I have a lot of people to credit for… I’ll be honest, Plan A was – and I will say candidly – was to probably eat a — well, probably to call it quits, if this ever came out. But some people saved me. Shout out Banks, shout out my parents, shout of y’all. I f***ed up, but I’m changed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s widely assumed Sketch was about to say he would have to ‘eat a bullet’ if this came out. His reference to Banks is a nod to FaZe Banks, who was supportive of Sketch when the news dropped online. Following his explanation, Sketch suggested he might be taking a break from streaming to get his head in the right space – but there’s still a chance he might quit, he said.</p>

Well right now Walmart is offering a <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRjOY?content_id=7953c3b3-369f-45a6-81ed-f5e6f99ab47b&amp;pagetype=article" target="_blank">SanDisk Ultra 512GB Micro SDXC Card</a> for only $24.99. Walmart+ members get free shipping, otherwise you need to get your order total to $35. Currently this is the least expensive 512GB Micro SDXC card we've seen from a legit brand.  It's part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-deals-sale-is-live-prime-day-competition-heats-up">Walmart's larger sale</a> that competes with Amazon Prime Day. SanDisk is owned by Western Digital and is the most popular memory card brand for the Nintendo Switch console.</p><p>Don't have a Walmart+ membership? <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/save-50-off-a-12-month-walmart-membership">It's currently 50% off</a>.</p><h2>512GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SDXC Card for $24.99</h2><div id="168464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch Compatible SanDisk Ultra 512GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>If you've started compiling a collection of digital games, you probably already know just how limited the Switch's base storage capacity is. The Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, some of it reserved for the OS. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. There's only one expansion slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford.</p><p>The SanDIsk Ultra Micro SDXC card is compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, Steam Deck, and the ASUS ROG Ally. It has a U1 A1 speed rating with up to 120MBps read speeds. There are faster cards out there, but the Nintendo Switch can't take advantage of such speeds. An SD card adapter is also included in the packaging.</p><p>Check out all of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals</a> for sales on other games and accessories.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 9, 2024 1:25 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It normally retails for $199, which was already a great deal because it included the full Animal Crossing: New Horizons game. It's part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-deals-sale-is-live-prime-day-competition-heats-up">Walmart's larger sale</a> that competes with Amazon Prime Day. We are pretty certain that Amazon will not match or beat this deal on Prime Day proper.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Lite with Animal Crossing for $159</h2><div id="202969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch Lite (Timmy &amp; Tommy’s Aloha Edition) Animal Crossing: New Horizons Bundle</h3></p></div><p>The Switch Lite retails for $100 less than the original Switch and $150 less than the Switch OLED. It is compatible with most Nintendo Switch games and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite is that (1) the controllers are not detachable, (2) the console can't be docked and played on a TV and (3) the display is smaller (5.5" vs 6.2" on Switch and 7" on Switch OLED). If you were intending to use the Switch solely as a handheld console, you might be better off just getting the Switch Lite. Even though the controls aren't detachable, the Switch Lite does support wireless Bluetooth, so you can always purchase another pair of Joy-Cons, a Switch Pro controller, or a compatible third party wireless Switch controller, and you can still play untethered.</p><p>If you enjoy life sim type games like Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, or Minecraft, you'll probably love Animal Crossing. It's obvious that Nintendo put in a lot of love into this first party title and it's certainly one of the best - and most relaxing - games for the Nintendo Switch. This is an excellent pick for gamers of all ages, even children.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-hellblade-2-sales-data-game-pass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Ninja Theory's action-adventure game largely struggled to crack the charts in May.</h2></div><section><p>Hellblade II was billed as one of 2024's big exclusives when it released back in May, but overall sales numbers have been hard to come by since launch. Now, thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-drops-the-hardest-as-all-consoles-decline-by-double-digits-compared-to-2023">Circana's most recent sales data</a>, we have a clearer idea of its performance.</p><p>According to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, Hellblade II was 37th overall in terms of full dollar sales for May 2024, putting it at 21st overall on the Xbox Series consoles. Hellblade II did not receive a physical release. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting a lot of questions on this one... Senua's Saga: Hellblade II ranked 37th overall for May 2024 in US full game dollar sales (physical + digital for sharing pubs), while ranking 21st on Xbox Series.</p>— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810414294665986168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Notably, Hellblade II released on Xbox Game Pass at launch, and that was born out in its engagement data, where it ranked 12th on Xbox in terms of monthly active users. That puts it just behind Fallout 76 on the platform, but ahead of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Apex Legends, and Forza Horizon 5.</p><p>Piscatella shared the sales info on X/Twitter, since Hellblade II's performance meant that it didn't appear on any of the major charts. Xbox and Ninja Theory have shared little about Hellblade II's sales since its initial release, leaving fans to speculate over Steam concurrents and other data. Gamesindustry.biz publisher Chris Dring noted that it failed to crack the Top 100 on European sales charts in what he described as a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"brutal month" for game sales.</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The sequel to the acclaimed action-adventure game by Ninja Theory, Hellblade II was announced not long after Xbox acquired the studio in 2018 and finally released earlier this year. It was described as a "defining moment in the evolution of real-time visuals" by <a href="https://x.com/digitalfoundry/status/1793689567838519686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review">we wrote in our own review</a>, "Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II delivers a spellbinding adventure packed with cinematic spectacle and story surprises that maintains a surging sense of forward momentum and never wastes a second of its slender run time."</p><p>Elsewhere, Ghost of Tsushima returned to number one thanks to its Steam release, while Call of Duty dominated the sales charts for both Xbox and PlayStation. Overall, though, it was a rough month for hardware spending as all three consoles recorded double-digit declines.</p><p>With Hellblade II now available, Xbox is looking ahead to the rest of 2024, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-know-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> among the first-party releases on its docket.

Following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-partnering-with-amazon-to-deliver-xbox-cloud-gaming-via-fire-tv-devices">announcement it's teaming up with Amazon</a> to bring Xbox games to Fire TV devices via cloud streaming, the initiative is now live for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.
</p>
<p>
Getting set up for console-free gaming with Fire TV is relatively straightforward; just download the Xbox app to a compatible device - Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Stick 4K Max are both supported - then sign in with an active Xbox Game Pass Ultimate account.
</p>
<p>
That'll give you access to Microsoft's <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/all-games">streamable Xbox Game Pass library</a> (a 20 Mbps internet connection over 5GHz Wi-Fi is recommended for play), with the last step being to connect a Bluetooth-enabled controller. The likes of the Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, and PlayStation DualSense are all supported.

<p>
Today's Fire TV rollout (which is available across 25 countries) follows the 2022 launch of Microsoft's Xbox app for Samsung TVs. Xbox boss Phil Spencer previously confirmed the app was Microsoft's new approach to bringing cloud gaming to the masses after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-decides-to-pivot-away-from-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box-for-now">pulled the plug</a> on its own Xbox cloud gaming device, codenamed Keystone, back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
A patent seemingly showcasing the ill-fated Keystone device's external design <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-xboxs-ill-fated-cloud-gaming-console-might-have-looked-like-according-to-newly-surfaced-patent">recently appeared online</a>, matching the "old prototype" version that set tongues wagging when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-phil-spencers-shelf-is-teasing-the-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box">was spotted on Phil Spencer's shelf</a> in October 2022.

<!-- cache hit 25:single/related:031cb7736f07f1fcbf58d1cbaae43f0a --><!-- empty -->
<p>It's been a whirlwind journey of stops and starts, but <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/05/apple-green-lights-epic-games-store-in-rapid-reversal">AppleInsider reports</a> the Epic Game Store for iOS in the European Union has passed Apple's notarization process.</p>
<p>This paves the way for Epic CEO Tim Sweeney to realize his long-stated goal of launching an alternative game store on Apple's closed platform—at least in Europe.</p>
<p>Apple announced plans to allow third-party app stores on iOS in the region earlier this year, complying with the letter of the law (though some say not the spirit) as required by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which was enacted in hopes of making platforms more open and competitive.</p>
<p>Apple's new policies allow for alternative app marketplaces but with some big caveats regarding the deal that app developers agree to. We discussed it in some detail <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">earlier this year</a>.
</p><p>The change followed years of contentious PR campaigns and court battles around the world between Epic and Apple, with Sweeney proclaiming that Apple's app approval processes are anti-competitive and that its 30 percent cut of app revenues is unfair.</p>
<p>Even after the shift, Apple is said to have rejected the Epic Games Store app twice. The rejections were over specific rules about the copy and shape of buttons within the app, though not about its primary function.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>With the rejections, Apple told Epic that some buttons within the app were too similar in both appearance and copy to Apple's own buttons—including the "Install" button and the "in-app purchases" copy. Apple felt that this violated rules it had set out in its guidelines to prevent developers from mimicking Apple app designs too closely, ostensibly confusing users.</p>
<p>After those rejections, <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809179985682325649">Epic took to X</a> to accuse Apple of rejecting the app in a way that was "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA." Epic claimed it followed Apple's suggested design conventions for the buttons and noted that the copy matched language it has been using in its store on other platforms for a long time.</p>
<p>Not long after, Apple went ahead and approved the app despite the disagreement over the copy and button designs. However, AppleInsider reported that Apple will still require Epic to change the copy and buttons later. Epic <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809658856466698515">disputed that on X</a>, and Sweeney offered <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1809336745613287445">his own take</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple’s DMA saga has taken a turn towards the absurd.</p>
<p>Apple is now telling reporters that this approval is temporary and are demanding we change the buttons in the next version - which would make our store less standard and harder to use.</p>
<p>We’ll fight this.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the matter remains contentious, it looks like the Epic Game Store will soon reach iPhone and iPad users in the European Union. Epic still has to build some key parts of the new storefront, such as its mobile payment system for the platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kotaku was launched in New York in 2004, and it didn't take long for readers (and advertisers) to realise it was a good website. So in 2008 the publication's owner at the time, Gawker Media, made a deal that saw the Kotaku brand licensed out to an Australian media company. And so Kotaku AU was born.</p><p>Based in Sydney and paying a fee to Gawker for the name and content, Kotaku Australia (and its stablemates Gizmodo AU and Lifehacker AU) served two masters. First, it handled the republication of the American site's content on a local masthead, where it could attract whole new ad deals. But it also hired Australian writers, who could publish their own criticism and do their own reporting.</p><p>This lent the site a voice of its own, an identity distinct from the American mothership, shaped by a succession of local (or at least locally-based) editors who were able to provide a softer tone and cultivate a community that, I'll be honest, was often the envy of the US site.</p><p>Kotaku AU was able to perform miracles relative to its headcount and budget, providing a constant stream of original reporting that held the local industry to account when needed, but could champion Australian games development and its community at the same time.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I’m tired of this heartless corpo bullshit. Fuck these dogs.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Anyway, you've read the headline already (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/is-the-media-prepared-for-an-extinction-level-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and are living through 2024 and the media apocalypse</a>) so you know why we're here writing these words in this tone: yesterday the owners of Kotaku AU--<a href="https://www.mi-3.com.au/08-07-2024/matt-rowley-exit-pedestrian-group-drops-vice-refinery29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the embattled Pedestrian Group</a>, part of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-28/nine-entertainment-job-cuts-commercial-media-slowing-economy/104036502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the even more embattled Nine Network</a>--<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jul/08/vice-kotaku-gizmodo-job-cuts-australia-channel-nine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down the sites and laid everyone off</a>. Writers weren't even allowed to access their CMS to say goodbye, leaving the site's last posts (at time of publishing) to be a report on <em>LA Noire</em> weirdness and a <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> tip.</p><p>Denied even that last dignified act--and disclosure time, because I've worked closely with many of these people and think they're all amazing--I've turned Aftermath over for one blog to former editors and writers of Kotaku Australia, so that they can share their thoughts and say their goodbyes.&nbsp;</p><p>First up is <strong>David Wildgoose</strong>, an elder statesman of Australian games media and the second Editor of Kotaku Australia:</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised that the Pedestrian Group would slow-walk to death a formerly vital hub of Australia's games community. Perhaps, as we survey the wreckage of the games media landscape over the past five years, the surprise is that Kotaku AU survived as long as it did. Regardless, the masthead and remaining editorial staff deserved a kinder fate than to be chewed up and spat out by an uncaring corporate machine.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Next up is the site's third Editor, the <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2017/07/fairy-bread-is-an-abomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decidedly un-Australian <strong>Mark Serrels</strong></a>, whose eight-year tenure perhaps marked the site's high-water mark, at least <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/i-spent-an-entire-day-wearing-a-sleeping-bag-because-i-like-playing-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in terms of the resources allocated to it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>News that the Australian edition of Kotaku has come to an end has been sitting heavy on me all day. It almost feels like the death of a distant, beloved relative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of eight years I published 11,000 posts on Kotaku Australia. The happiest times of my professional life were spent working on the site, publishing everything from news, reviews to unhinged shitposts. Every now and then I’d also post stuff that felt important. Those days were the best.</p><p>I’ve worked at a number of places – and loved it – but I don’t think I ever feel as aligned with a website’s purpose like I did at Kotaku Australia. At the time it was simply tailor-made for me and the way I wanted to write. I could do pretty much anything I wanted. I walked around Sydney wearing a sleeping bag all day. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/features/the-time-i-tried-polyphasic-sleep-and-started-hallucinating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I did a completely cooked polyphasic sleep experiment</a> so I could play more video games. It was a wild time and I’ve tried to replicate that energy to every place I’ve worked since.&nbsp;</p><p>Kotaku Australia had its own unique identity, and a truly powerful community. They welcomed me with open arms and those first couple of years were magic. The TAYbies as they called themselves (it’s a long story) were endlessly supportive of the work I wanted to do and drowned out the gross mess of gaming discourse during dark times. In the depths of Gamergate that community got me through some truly challenging days. I met lifelong friends through Kotaku Australia. In fact, I just caught up with one of them at the pub last weekend. (Hi Ruffleberg!)</p><div><p>It was also a wicked conveyor belt for talent. I hired Jackson Ryan not once but twice and first met him through the Kotaku community (he once won a competition for writing a story about pissing himself while playing <em>Super Mario World</em>). I met Dan Crowd, who now looks after gaming content at the ABC, at a Kotaku meet-up. Zorine Te, who went to Gamespot and became an esports superstar, used to be a community mainstay as well! And hey – did you know that my old Dep Ed Tracey Lien is now a famous best-selling author?</p><p>That’s not to mention all the incredible people I worked with across all three sites. I hesitate to name names because I’m a moron and I’ll miss someone important, but almost all of the best games and tech journalists in Australia had a stint on these sites at one time and we all learned something important from one another. It was a melting pot for “good shit” before I arrived and it was a melting pot for “good shit” long after I left.</p><p>And on that note, a special shout out to the folks who steered Kotaku in its final days. David Smith, Emily Spindler, Courtney Borret, Lauren Rouse and Chris Neill among others were killing it. It absolutely sucks they’ve been cut off at the peak of their powers.</p><p>I’m gutted, absolutely gutted.&nbsp;</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>...the masthead and remaining editorial staff deserved a kinder fate than to be chewed up and spat out by an uncaring corporate machine...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Tegan Jones</strong>, an award-winning tech journo who worked across all three Gawker-down-under sites (and was Editor of Gizmodo Australia) says:</p><blockquote><div><p>I’m beyond heartbroken over the demise of Gizmodo, Kotaku &amp; Lifehacker Australia. </p><p>The people working across these publications - some of the last bastions of paid, niche tech journalism in this country - were powerhouses who deserved better. </p><p>I’m so sorry for them all. </p><p>Gizmodo was my life for so long. Being its editor was something I took very seriously. It was my dream job. I wore the title proudly. For better or worse, it was my entire identity for a while there. Perhaps that’s a good lesson in the importance of divorcing one’s sense of self from the thing that pays their rent. </p><p>Because in this business, one day, it probably won’t.</p><p>Still, I’m not the only former editor to express such sentiments about Giz. There’s gotta be a reason for that. I will always love it for changing my life and the part it has always played in local tech journalism under so many wonderful and talented editors. </p><p>The same goes for Kotaku and Lifehacker. </p><p>Just look at the public lamentations of all former editors and writers across these publications - some of whom haven’t worked there in years. They weren't just jobs or websites for us. Gracing the digital pages of these sites will always be career highlights. Life highlights even.</p><p>For many of us, they gave us our first big breaks. They were our homes. For Alex [Ed's note: former Kotaku AU Editor Alex Walker] and myself in particular, they were the catalyst for our nine year relationship. Kotaku is the reason we met - at a local <em>Need For Speed </em>preview, which is eternally hilarious. </p><p>Looking at the toxic flames engulfing the local tech media landscape, I honestly don’t see a way forward. Perhaps that’s the sadness of the day speaking, but considering the dire state even mainstream journalism is in, I’m afraid I may be the right amount of jaded. </p><p>Regardless of what the future may hold, I think we can all agree that the industry will be worse off without these publications. It’s a dark day for Australian journalism and tech media globally - something that is becoming alarmingly common.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>Ruby Innes</strong> was a great writer and an even better illustrator for Kotaku AU. Few things brought me more joy over the site's 16-year history than <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/06/how-to-be-a-gamer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeing some weird little guy she'd drawn at the top of a very good post</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>I started at Kotaku AU in November 2021 and finished up in July 2023. Yeah, I wasn’t there for yonks, but I like to think I made myself known in a way. Not a smart or intellectual way, but definitely A Way.</p><p>Thanks to my wonderful editor David Smith, I was allowed to go turbo. I wrote some bonkers shit, some bonkers shit disguised as real shit, and some very personal shit too. I got to draw all sorts of silly drawings to go along with my insane ‘illustrated guides’ too, and that was a treat. But most importantly, I got to talk to so many cool people both in and out of the games industry, and shine a spotlight on Australia’s local games industry. Writing for Kotaku AU opened my eyes to a world of local game dev talent that I hadn’t seen before, and boosted my love for games in a way I’m very thankful for.</p><p>Kotaku AU has been a beacon for writing about games in Australia in a unique way. So many talented writers, artists, game devs, and so on have had their work published on Kotaku AU. Sure, it came with baggage, but Kotaku AU very much stood on its own two feet as an Australian games publication that gave a shit about the local industry. And wasn’t afraid to dig deep or have a chuckle.</p><p>The loss of Kotaku AU is fucked. The games journalism world is fucking cooked right now, and to see one of the biggest platforms that Australia has in games journalism disappear in one fell swoop alongside other great titles is sickening. I’m tired of this heartless corpo bullshit. Fuck these dogs. Love to Kotaku AU and everybody that played a part in making it what it was.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>Amanda Yeo</strong>, one of the smartest writers and critics I have ever worked with,  says:</p><blockquote><div><p>My early years at Kotaku Australia were some of the happiest of my career. Kotaku AU gave me my start in games journalism, enthusiastically encouraged by then-editor Mark Serrels (to whom I will always be grateful). I loved my time there, and in another universe where things went differently, I can picture myself having chosen to stay.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the many lessons I learned there was that good things rarely last. I had hoped Kotaku AU would always continue on, enduring the ups, downs, and many challenges to remain a constant stalwart. In my more optimistic musings, I even imagined Kotaku AU growing beyond what it was in my nostalgic memories, likely while I watched enviously from the sidelines.</p><p>I simply couldn't picture an Australian games journalism scene without Kotaku AU. Even with it now a sombre reality, I still struggle to comprehend it.</p><p>Being a full-time games journalist was barely feasible when I began in this industry, and it's only gotten worse in the years since. Kotaku AU was a bastion for Australian games journalism, offering not only entertaining, informative, and heartfelt content, but also some of the few opportunities in the country for writers covering this beat. It's devastating to think of those opportunities now being turned to dust, leaving budding writers with one less buoy to cling to in increasingly rough seas. Without Kotaku AU and its sister sites Gizmodo AU and Lifehacker AU, my life would have been very different. Now even fewer people will get a similar chance.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>I wrote some bonkers shit, some bonkers shit disguised as real shit, and some very personal shit too</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Alex Walker</strong>, who joined Kotaku AU as a journalist in 2015 before spending five years as its Editor, says:</p><blockquote><p>I loved writing for everyone on Kotaku Australia. Everyone I worked with did the same, and that applied to the other local wings just as much. And as we go full steam ahead into the AI-generated shitstain of a content world that is already upon us, I believe more than ever that human beings want that reverence, that love, that deep personal passion for the same things they love and share.</p><p>The question is, who pays for it? I haven’t figured out that part yet. But if they can, I know there’s a legion of folks who will go to the wire to bring that content to life. I just hope that this time they’ll be greeted with an owner and managers with a vision and a belief that lasts longer than a quarter.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I've left the last word to <strong>David Smith</strong>, Kotaku Australia's final steward, who performed Herculean tasks to the end despite an ever-dwindling budget and precarious ownership:</p><blockquote><p>Long before I worked there, I revered Kotaku Australia as the gold standard for Australian games coverage. Its features were the best. Its headlines were the best. Its writers were the best. I never thought I'd get to write for Kotaku AU, much less run it. But for two and a half years, I got to do just that.</p><p>I took that custodianship seriously and gave it everything. Its coverage of Australian games development was second to none. Serrels' stories about working conditions at EB Games still send shivers down the spines of those who worked there at the time. Alex's understanding of byzantine government process made it a leader in policy reporting around the games industry. Carrying that standard consumed my life, dramatically worsened my personal health, and required a considerable and surprising amount of my own money to get us to events or ensure our writers had review code due to being tarred with the US' many blacklists. I was up at 6am every day to get stories on the page for the morning commuters and I rarely logged off before 9 at night.</p><p>And I loved it. There were days I hated it, but I loved it.</p><p>KotAU was different to the US flagship in many ways, and it won us dedicated readers. Not just for our local coverage, but our tone too. We weren't as acidic as the US site could be, our takes considered more even-handed or good-natured. We still called a spade a spade and got ourselves in trouble with publishers as often as the US site, so I still feel we did our bit for the brand.</p><p>It was never easy, and often frustrating. Pedestrian Group never really understood Kotaku AU or how to get the most out of the brand commercially. Truthfully, it wasn't ever a good fit there, the PGroup voice and that of Kotaku AU couldn't have been more different. However, that lack of understanding had its benefits. Because they weren't really paying attention to us, we were able to publish a ton of cool shit. Sure, by the end, Google Discover plays were the only way to keep the SEO traffic hose flowing, but we fought to keep great stories coming. We even founded a TikTok (something the US site still hasn't done) and amassed a dedicated audience there by doing what we'd always done -- cutting the shit and talking to the audience like people, not consumers.</p><p>I'm still shellshocked that it's over. I don't know what's next. The shadow Kotaku AU cast is long and irreplaceable. I leave knowing I did everything I could to save and preserve it. I hope that, for the people who loved the site as much as I did, that will be enough.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
