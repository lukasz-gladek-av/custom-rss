<p>IT'S HAPPENING</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Team Cherry's "special announcement" gave us what we were all hoping for, Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch on <strong>4th September</strong>.</p>
<p>The reveal gave us a closer look at the gameplay, showcasing the "lethal acrobatic action", "vast handcrafted world", and a massive roster of enemies (200 regular enemies and 40 bosses, to be precise).</p>
<p>Let's remember that this is the biggest look we've had at the game in <em>years</em>, and 4th September is so very close! Here's a closer look at some of the trailer's stunning moments:</p>

<p>Look, we're really rather excited about the whole thing. We recently went hands-on with the game at Gamescom, and we were very impressed with what we saw. Can it really live up to the hype? We don't have long until we find out...</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Date Finally Revealed for September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-for-september.1277121/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, it's finally happened; after six years of development and lengthy silences on the part of developer Team Cherry, the&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date has been revealed at last.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's special announcement (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week" rel="nofollow">was first teased on Tuesday</a>),&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be releasing on September 4th. It's good of Team Cherry not to keep us waiting for too much longer after we've already waited for so long!</p>

<p>The game's release date was announced as part of a brand new trailer that also showed off protagonist Hornet's impressively acrobatic moveset, as well as some of the enemies and bosses you'll be facing as you bring "hope" to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s ruined kingdom du jour.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-acrobatics.jpg?itok=EB14JlPm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-acrobatics.jpg?itok=eLg2dEhQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>looks like a much more acrobatic game than the first.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, much of&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>will look familiar to you if you're a&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>fan, but the new trailer promises that you'll be able to face off against more than 200 enemies and vanquish over 40 new bosses, so it's fair to say this is almost certainly a much bigger and more expansive game than its predecessor.</p>

<p>Hornet's moves look much more acrobatic than her predecessor knight's, too; she can chain jumps, attacks, dashes, and more together for some specatacular-looking platforming that looks just as nimble and satisfying as the first game's gauntlets.</p>

<p>We also get a glimpse of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s map in the new trailer, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed if you're hoping for a massive, interconnected Metroidvania world to explore. In short,&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>is looking every bit like the game we've all hoped it would be since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">that fateful day in 2019</a>.</p>

<p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>launches on September 4th across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and both Nintendo Switch 2 and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-1575920.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years and years of waiting, the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching, and it’s not too much longer until you can finally get your hands on the title. We’ve got all the details on the release date.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong thoroughly impressed us in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and the positive reception immediately led to a desire from players for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-download-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong demo</a> to be downloadable.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to add the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date to your calendar and potentially prepare to call in sick from work or school, we’ve got the precise details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-hollow-knight-silksong-coming-out">When is Hollow Knight: Silksong Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready. Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After years of waiting, Hollow Knight: Silksong finally has an official release date and will be available worldwide on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>First announced in February 2019, and even having a playable demo at E3 that year, it’s been a long six-year wait for fans waiting for the title. At times, you’d be forgiven for wondering if you’d be stuck waiting for the release until the end of time.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has delivered, though, with a release date much sooner than many may have expected, so it won’t be too much longer until the long wait comes to an end and you’re experiencing a historic moment in gaming history.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-start-times">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s too early to provide an exact start time for Hollow Knight: Silksong and when exactly it will be playable, but we might be able to hazard a guess.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hollow-knight-silksong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is confirmed to be a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass, which has a fairly set schedule for releases and the majority of titles become playable at 7am PT/9am CT/10am ET/3pm BST/12am AEST.</p>



<p>That’s only an estimate, however, but bookmark this page as we’ll update the article as soon as we have an accurate start time. For now, the release date is the most important piece of information, and after years of waiting for that to be revealed, I’m sure you can cope a little while longer for start times.</p>

This explorable hub area blends quiet moments of preparation with new layers of storytelling. Here, you’ll meet <a title="Games > Dew" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dew">Dew</a>, the mysterious goddess who guides your journey, and interact with new NPCs that offer quests, gear upgrades, auctions, and essential services.

While some remain faithful, others walk a new path. Blasphemer Seers reject the Goddess of Light and channel their suffering into brutal close-quarters combat. Wielding maces infused with elemental devastation, they unleash a Special State that fuels explosive burst damage and savage flanking strikes. It’s a violent rebuke of divinity—and a deadly asset in the right hands.</li><li><strong>New Boss: General Harald</strong> – Prepare for an unforgettable boss encounter—General Harald, former hero of Brandrgarde. Once a revered commander, his soul was lost in a desperate experiment to stop the Gyldenmist. Now, twisted by madness and power, Harald guards the ruins as a relentless executioner. Only the most fearless Gyldhunters will survive him—and claim the treasures he protects.</li><li><strong>Playable Female Characters and Customization Debut</strong> – The female versions of all five core classes—Sorcerer, Black Arrow, Shadowstrix, Mercenary, and Seer—are now fully playable. Alongside this long-awaited feature, Beta 3 introduces the first wave of character customization, giving players more freedom to define their identity in the Age of Corrosion.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Mistfall Hunter</em> is due out for Xbox Series and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9pn5wjm7v6m0" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Silksong stars Hornet, a hunter and supporting character in the first game, as she explores a new kingdom boasting over 150 new enemies to slay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Admittedly, from what I've seen of newcomer developer Rebel Wolves' upcoming first game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/23/check-out-20-minutes-of-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-in-new-gameplay-overview">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, it's given off some heavy Witcher vibes. That's not completely misplaced, considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/dawnwalker-is-the-name-of-an-upcoming-dark-fantasy-rpg-by-former-cd-projekt-red-devs">Rebel Wolves was formed by former CD Projekt Red devs</a> with experience working on The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. Sure, there are vampires, but it's still a medieval dark fantasy where the protagonist is a gruff swordsman with one goal in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>After an hour-long hands-off preview with Dawnwalker, though, it's clear this game is much more than just The Witcher with vampires. Sitting in the room, themed to look like a 14th-century chapel, I frantically took notes of what I was watching on screen, wishing the entire time I was the one playing the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The demo begins in the valley of the Carpathian mountains, sometime during the 14th century. A plague has swept the land, weakening humanity, making them easier than ever to be overtaken by the Vrakhiri, or a race of vampires. Our protagonist, Coen, is what's called a Daywalker, and though details on what that entails are still murky after my preview, it's clear he is at least part vampire.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebel Wolves showcased this by running us through the same quest twice: once during the night, when Coen is tapped into his vampire side, and once during the day, when he can't use his vampiric abilities but can utilize magic. Though this quest ended on the same note both ways, there was an impressive amount of variation between the day and night versions.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebel Wolves began with the nighttime version of the quest.&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately, I'm impressed with the visuals. Sure, the game has been Epic's baby for demonstrating Unreal Engine 5 in recent showcases, but the art team is doing some gorgeous work with lighting. The way the full moon above illuminates the central cathedral's stained glass reminded me of the stained glass I witnessed myself at the Dom cathedral here in Cologne. Alongside the full moon high above in the sky is a red full moon, indicating Coen can tap into his vampire abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coen infiltrates a cathedral and sticks to the upper floors as, down below, a blood ritual is happening. He uses Plane Shift to walk on walls and ceilings like Spider-Man, albeit on two feet. He also utilizes Shadowstep, which allows him to teleport short distances by transforming into a moving shadow. In the cathedral, he searches nearby Frescoes painted on the ceiling, looking for a clue as to the whereabouts of St. Mihia's crypt, which houses a sword he's after.&nbsp;</p><p>After a bit more exploration, Coen fights off some enemies using his claws. It's fast, visceral, and extremely gory, with dismemberment galore. He also uses Voracious Bite to suck their blood and regain some health. Rebel Wolves says this is useful in battle but even more effective outside of combat. Rebel Wolves also uses this encounter to show off the options to switch between a far and close camera in combat (and a separate option to customize this viewpoint in exploration, too).&nbsp;</p><p>We eventually reach the crypt, and this portion of the demo ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the daytime version of the quest, Coen is unable to tap into his vampiric abilities, so he must investigate things more closely. To keep it somewhat spoiler-free, instead of climbing walls and ceilings and Shadowstepping to different platforms, Coen speaks with a local monk and agrees to help them find a missing person. This leads him to an abandoned portion of an asylum, and it turns out the person he's after has become The Almshouse Monstrosity. This person is neither undead nor alive, stuck in the transition from human to vampire, and their mind is essentially gone, driven by an instinctual desire for blood.&nbsp;</p><p>In this form of combat, Coen uses a sword instead of claws, and it's here that the game looks most like The Witcher. However, Rebel Wolves is doing some interesting things here. Combat features directional blocking, like what's seen in the Kingdom Come: Deliverance series, and magic, too. After defeating this monstrosity, Coen uses the Compel Soul hex to speak with a corpse and learn what happened in this asylum. This corpse yields some useful information that eventually takes Coen to the same crypt from the conclusion of the nighttime demo, except this time, Rebel Wolves showcases what happens next. I won't spoil it here, but it's an awesome boss fight against an undead warrior, and it's clear you'll need to tap into all of Coen's abilities to come out victorious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our demo ended here, and a day later, I'm voracious for more. It just looks awesome, and a great score heightens the entire experience. Like The Witcher, the score in Dawnwalker relies heavily on a high-pitched female chorus, and it rules. I can't wait to hear more of this and see more of the vampires that run this part of the world when The Blood of the Dawnwalker launches sometime next year.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/21/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-more-than-the-witcher-with-vampires]]></content:encoded>

			<p>After six years of waiting, Hollow Knight developer <a href="http://After%20six%20years%20of%20waiting,%20Hollow%20Knight%20developer%20Team%20Cherry%20has%20announced%20a%20release%20date%20for%20Hollow%20Knight%20Silksong%20during%20Gamescom%202025.%20The%20highly%20anticipated%20metroidvania%20will%20launch%20on%20PC,%20PS5,%20PS4,%20Xbox%20One,%20Xbox%20Series%20X/S,%20Nintendo%20Switch,%20and%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20on%20September%204,%202025.https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">Team Cherry</a> has announced a release date for Hollow Knight Silksong during Gamescom 2025. The highly anticipated metroidvania will launch on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>The waiting is almost over, but almost more importantly, the anticipation and disappointment at every major videogame related event that has taken place in the last six years is actually over, and we can now sit back and relax without having to wonder if Hollow Knight Silksong will appear at The Game Awards this year, or at Summer Game Fest next year, and so on.</p>



<p>The special announcement hosted by Team Cherry today was watched live by more than a quarter of a million people, which further shows how excited fans of the first game are to see something new from Team Cherry.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the announcement didn't disappoint, with even more gameplay showing off the wide variety of bosses, enemies, and new areas you'll be able to explore in this hand-painted adventure.</p>

              <p>Every version of the PlayStation 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">is now $50 more expensive</a> in the U.S., but at least for now, a new deal at GameStop will cover the difference. The meme stock retailer announced it will start giving anyone who trades in their last-gen consoles an extra $50 in-store credit toward the purchase of a new PS5.</p> <p>This deal applies to anyone trading in an old PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. If you really want a PS5, it’s better than nothing. The all-digital edition, the cheapest Sony offers, is now $500 starting August 21. So instead of just getting $55 toward that from trading in a PS4, you’ll get $110. An Xbox One currently trades for about $45, so just $95 total. The Switch isn’t much better. You’ll only get $60 for it before the new bonus credit, even though Nintendo recently raised the price of a new one to $340.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Offer valid through 8.23.25” is in such small print at the bottom lol</p> <p>GameStop only has your back for a few days 💀</p> <p>— Carlton (@carlton_ec08) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlton_ec08/status/1958345035302240471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Xbox Series X/S owners looking to move over to PlayStation will have it a little easier. A Series S, now sold new at $370, will still get you up to $176, while a Series X, sold for $600, will get you up to $300. I could see taking that. When it comes to the other consoles, the price difference is harder to swallow. GameStop also buries in the fine print that this <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">bonus Trump tariff credit</a> will only be active through August 23.</p> <p>Is it better than nothing? Sure! But it still lowkey sucks in the worst way. This whole thing is basically GameStop saying, “Reckless trade policy has hiked the price of a PS5, so here’s a bonus credit for these already terrible trade-in values that you’ll have to give right back to us.” GameStop’s edgelord CEO Ryan Cohen, despite being Canadian, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1908538518919323827">a big booster</a> of Trump, even as the president rolled out the current tariff regime earlier this year. His Elon Musk-lite impression included using the sale of GameStop’s Canadian operation <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/gamestop-selling-canadian-french-operations-stores-ryan-cohen-wokeness-dei/">to dunk on DEI policies</a>. He’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">using GameStop to buy billions in Bitcoin</a>.</p>

After various jump scares (Espurr! A Clefairy doll!) we finally see the new Mega species.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/21/screenshot-2025-08-21-150629-1755781658156.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Victreebell.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The volume of this Pokémon’s acid has increased due to Mega Evolution, filling its mouth," reads an official blurb for the creature. "If it’s not careful, the acid will overflow and spill out." Delightful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A features a long-awaited return to the Kalos region, home to the series' popular Mega Evolution mechanic. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">previous trailer announced Mega Dragonite</a>, the franchise's first new Mega Pokémon in over a decade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not confirmed, Legends Z-A expected to feature several dozen new Mega Pokémon designs, as well as familiar Mega Pokémon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Absol, and Mega Charizard X.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Pokémon Legends: Z-A's story, it involves the seemingly-spontaneous Mega Evolution of local wild Pokémon, dubbed Rogue Mega Pokémon. You'll need to utilise your own Mega Pokémon to take them down, and you can also bring in help from one of your allies to battle alongside you.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">first hands-on impressions of Pokémon Legends Z-A's battle systems</a>, "but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but I do hope Legends: Z-A gets challenging enough to make me more intentionally dish out commands and think about switching Pokémon at just the right moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

And it's because of this (as well as the post's subsequent removal) that fans now believe Japan is Forza Horizon 6's setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exciting news!" the post read. "We have Cody here, from @forzahorizonofficial, shooting cars for the next installation in the series. As there are no late-model Kei cars in America, he has flown out from the states to use our cars as the basis for their digital versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are HUGE gamers here at Cult and Classic, and it is an honor to be supporting Forza and making Kei cards accessible virtually for people who can't have them IRL."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Knoebel goes GamesCom (@Knoebelbroet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1958294206205858164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japan has ranked highly among the most-requested locations for Forza Horizon 6, following previous series entries set in Australia, Mexico and the UK.

<p>Currently, Silksong has made its grand return to Gamescom, and there are already long lines snaking through the Koelnmesse for a chance to play the highly anticipated game.</p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p>

                <p>It's not long until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> finally comes out--something that seems like an achievement in its own right given its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-canceled-after-its-last-delay/1100-6497078/">almost-cancellation</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-the-first-half-of-2025/1100-6525970/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-october/1100-6530367/">delays</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-still-coming-in-october-despite-developer-layoffs-publisher-says/1100-6532699/">layoffs at developer The Chinese Room</a>. That impending release does appear to come with a small caveat, however. As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, while the base game will feature four clan types, there are two more that will be available at launch--as long as you're willing to pay for them.</p><p dir="ltr">These two extra clans, Lasombra and Toreador, will come as part of the Shadows and Silk add-on pack, which will set you back $22, and it seems like there's no other way to get them. Eurogamer notes how one big issue here is that not only do clans affect how you play, but even shape the difficulty of your playthrough. The original Bloodlines also notably features seven clans in total.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 | Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While attending Gamescom, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it" rel="nofollow ">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> had the opportunity to speak to The Chinese Room and asked about the decision to turn these clans into DLC as opposed to including them in the base game. The simple answer is just that the new clans were additional work on top of the developer's original plans for the game. This additional work occasionally came at publisher Paradox's request, so the overall argument is that it's fair to sell them separately because it was extra work.</p><p dir="ltr">Narrative director Ian Thomas further explained how over the course of development and those numerous delays, a "huge amount of changes" have been made to the game, "Including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it.</p><p dir="ltr">"So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go, 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it."</p><p dir="ltr">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is due out October 21, and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> has finally received a release date, as announced today by Team Cherry today along with a new trailer.</p>
<p>Silksong will be available on 4th September across Switch consoles, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, including on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>News of today's announcement was hinted at earlier this week at gamescom's Opening Night Live, along with a fresh look at gameplay. More of that was shown in the new announcement video you can watch below:</p>

<p>Silksong is playable at the event too, though it's the same demo that was shown back in 2019 - albeit in revised form. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gamescom-queues-over-an-hour-and-reddit-in-overdrive-hollow-knight-silksong-hype-has-outpaced-everything-from-opening-night-live">proving to be a particularly popular game</a> at the show.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Dom Peppiatt braved the queues to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gamescom-queues-over-an-hour-and-reddit-in-overdrive-hollow-knight-silksong-hype-has-outpaced-everything-from-opening-night-live">hands-on with Silksong</a>, and came away impressed with its high challenge and how Hornet's movement differs from the original game's Knight.</p>
<p>After seven years of development, finally Silksong is almost in our hands.</p>

			<p>Over the years, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have tried their hands – or flippers, I guess? – at numerous video game genres. There’s been Turtle inspired side-scrolling beat ‘em ups, one-on-one fighters, platformers, a light gun shooter, and a roguelike. Heck, even the pinball genre has been taken on by the awesome foursome. Now, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, the brothers are giving turn-based strategy a go.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown: CONSOLE RELEASE TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOjavINypzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The brothers have fallen out and gone their separate ways, again, which is a popular and often regurgitated plot device for Turtles’ films, TV shows, and comics, but here it provides developer Strange Scaffold with the opportunity to teach the player the tactical idiosyncrasies for each solo ninja, before bringing them together for a bombastic finale. Each grid-based level sees a turtle nunchuck their way from one end to the other, bashing the hordes of bad guys they meet on their way.</p>


<p>In a neat touch, to avoid the potentially plodding pace of a TBS, a sense of dynamic urgency is created as each level begins to rapidly fall away as you progress through it, forcing you to keep moving forward at all times. Dilly-dally in one place too long and the ground will fall away beneath your Turtle’s shell, sending them plummeting into the void. Thankfully, there’s a pleasing tactical component provided by this, as each turtle has several attacks that knock enemies backwards. Get yourself into the right position with your limited number of action points and you can send packs of enemies to their demise in one satisfying scenery smashing moment.</p>


<p>And you’ll certainly need every strategic advantage you can get, as Tactical Takedown is a surprisingly challenging game. This game is based upon the Nickelodeon division of the Ninja Turtles empire, so it’s ostensibly aimed at kids. Well, that’s not the case for Tactical Takedown, which keeps the pressure on throughout, sending vast swathes of new enemies every turn, forcing you to use each of the Turtles’ abilities with precision to have any chance of success. One mistake and it’s game over.</p>
<p>In truth, things get rather grindy, the never-ending baddies popping into existence faster than you can clear the decks, turning proceedings into a real slog, particularly in the latter stages. Matters aren’t helped by the game doing a poor job of explaining its mechanics, likely leading to many players bouncing off the frequent difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Stick with it through its runtime of a handful of hours, and you’ll discover a smart and ultimately satisfying strategy game. And when the gameplay mechanics click, and you have a perfect turn in which your turtle flips, hacks, slides, and dropkicks their way through a multitude of foot ninjas, you can’t help but have a good time. It’s just a shame that I could never quite get on with the visuals. Tactical Takedown is a digital recreation of a board game. As such, there is little to no animation, each character plonking around the place like a pawn on a chess board. This stylistic choice lessened the experience for me. Sure, the game is telling me that Michelangelo just ollied on his skateboard over the head of some goons, striking them as he went, but it doesn’t want to show me that. All I saw was one static piece leaping over another static piece. For some, this lack of animation and characterisation might be no big deal, but it left me cold.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-free-story-update-the-lost-harvest-dlc-free-trial/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dune-awakening-free-story-chapter-and-paid-dlc-the-lost-harvest-out-next-month-free-trial-on-now.1276989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/chapter-2-free-update-and-the-lost-harvest-dlc/">announced </a>that the first free story chapter for its massive multiplayer survival game, Dune: Awakening, will be out next month on September 10, 2025. Alongside the free update, Funcom is also releasing a paid DLC called The Lost Harvest, which has a standalone storyline separate from the free Chapter 2 update. And if you've yet to try Dune: Awakening but have been keen to check it out, you can do so now with a free trial on until August 24, 2025.</p>



<p>Chapter 2 of the story will be added as a free update for all owners of the game, and beyond more story content to dig through, it'll add a few highly-requested features, like being able to re-customize your player character, new hairstyles and tattoos, new contracts, more dynamic encounters, and new armor archetypes.</p>



<p>The Lost Harvest paid DLC is available separately for $12.99 USD, though if you've purchased the Season Pass, then you'll be getting The Lost Harvest as part of the pass. On top of everything else that comes in the free update, players who purchase The Lost Harvest DLC and/or purchase the Season Pass will get a new vehicle to explore Arrakis in with the Treadwheel. Three new Imperial Testing Stations to plunder, five new base decorations, four new weapon skins, two new armor skins, new Dune Man-themed building pieces for your base, and a thumper emote, on top of the separate story content that comes with The Lost Harvest.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the free trial, it's available for those wanting to test out a journey on Arrakis for themselves from now until August 24, and lets you spend 10 hours with the game running around Hagga Basin before the trial ends. There are a few areas that are unavailable in the trial, such as Harko Village, Arrakeen, and the Deep Desert, though in fairness, it would take you more than just 10 hours of gameplay to reach at least one of those areas.</p>



<p>You'll also be restricted to free trial servers, but if you do purchase the game, all your story progress, character level, skill and tech points, and the contents in your backpack will be carried over. The only things you'll need to rebuild are your base and vehicle, and if you managed to acquire more than 10,000 Solaris, you'll lose anything over that limit. You'll also get a few cosmetic items when you go from the free trial to the full game.</p>



<p>This is the first major content update for Dune: Awakening, and players who've been down on Arrakis since the game launched earlier this year will be happy for it, since anyone playing with some level of consistency has run through all the content that was included with the game at launch. What'll be more interesting for those players beyond the new content, is how Funcom re-balances the game with this new update, as there are surely going to be more tweaks coming on September 10th.</p>

<p>All you really need to play&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;is the rulebook, three different sized measuring sticks, an assortment of classic RPG dice (two each of: d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s, and a d20), markers to track which units have activated, and any like-sized spaceship models you can muster. Much like another of my favorite Osprey Games releases,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frostgrave-fireheart-and-blood-legacy-preview-new-rules-for-frozen-north" rel="nofollow">Frostgrave</a>,&nbsp;</em><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is miniature agnostic. This means you can field old <i>X-Wing&nbsp;</i>miniatures, kit-bash something cool from parts you have lying around, or even use cardboard cutouts. All that's needed is a uniform size across you and your opponent's models.</p>

<h2>Playing The Game</h2>

<p><em>Voidfighter'</em>s rules are meant to get miniatures onto the tabletop as quickly as possible, while still giving the player just enough to crunch on to not make it feel shallow by any means. Each round of the game consists of five phases: the Command phase, the Initiative phase, the Movement phase, the Gunnery phase, and the Maintenance phase.</p>

<p>In the Command and Initiative phases, players gain command points (which can be spent on daring maneuvers and upgrades) and roll to determine who activates their models first. In&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>, you definitely&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;want to be activating first, as it gives your opponent more information.</p>

To do these maneuvers, you're usually rolling piloting rolls to which each have their own downside should you fail the roll!</p>

<p>In the Gunnery phase, blasters are unleashed as guns send streaks of light through the cold dark of space! With opposed rolls (that's how the whole game plays out, you roll two dice, as does your opponent to contest you) and easy determining of who's in your line of sight and who's in range, this has to be one of the snappiest dogfighting games I've ever tried.</p>

<p>The book goes on to cover rules for terrain and scenario-based models like Asteroids and space creatures, helps you design your squadron and individual ships in The Shipyard, shows off ships for various factions within the game, offers up 12 different scenarios, and has rules for extended campaign play... and it all adds layers to the game without bogging it down.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-photo-1.jpeg?itok=Ts7nNW9k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-photo-1.jpeg?itok=xhOLLCpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Enjoying The Trip</h2>

<p>And that's what I love about these rules, and what makes reading this rulebook so fun. Everything is meant to be easy and intuitive, without feeling too simplistic. You'll find yourself zooming around the board, trying to outflank your opponents as you fire off round after round of guns, torpedoes, and more. It's fast and let's you chuck plenty of dice.</p>

<p>Of all the elements of&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;that most surprised me and kept me engaged throughout my read-through of the rules, the sense of humor and high-quality prose author Casey Garske most stood out. When cracking open a new rulebook for a sci-fi dogfighting skirmish game, I have to admit: I was expecting a pretty dry affair.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=RDewXm6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=9JpGsETK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Garske's writing - even when writing out the rules for movement - can't help but shine with its approachable, breezy tone. On top of that, he's created a world for this game that feels wonderfully fleshed out&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;bogging the reader down with heaps of lore. You get a few paragraphs about the universe at large, and then its off to the (space) races.</p>

<p>Another element that really serves the game is its treatment of reality, which it keeps at arm's length. There's a lot of gleeful hand-waving away of hard physics, which is a very good thing, as this wonderful little spark of a game would grind to a halt if it worried too much about things like g-force.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=pEd2Bppw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=-7N10pUP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is another grand-slam from publisher Osprey Games, and it shows just how wide open the field of miniature agnostic wargaming truly is. And in the practiced hands of a designer like Garske, there's truly no limit to the amount of creativity and ingenuity we can see from this type of wargame. Untethered by trying to sell their own lumbering miniature line,&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is allowed to feel nimble - like a snubfighter just dropping into orbit.</p>

<p>If you've got a stack of spaceship miniatures lying around and you're looking for something to do with them, or you want to get into the world of kit-bashing or 3D-printing, or the light and easy tone of this game sounds appealing to you - then I cannot recommend highly enough&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>. Jump in, pilot!</p>

<p>Elden Ring is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and it reportedly struggles to run on the latest Nintendo console?</p>



<p>According to Nintendo Life’s Felix Sanchez, who spent time with the game while in Cologne for Gamescom the game has serious performance issues on the Switch 2 when playing in handheld mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Performance wise, here at that big first fight, as soon as you step outside, the framerate drops quite substantially,”</strong> Sanchez said while mentioning that it’s always locked at 30 frames per second</p>



<p>He then continued: <strong>“You get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks. It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this.</strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-gamescom-future-games-show-at-gamescom-2025-everything-announced">More Gamescom: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-games-show-gamescom-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025: Everything Announced</a></h6>



<p><strong>“It is terrible. Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this because—well, maybe it’ll release in that state, but I can’t imagine it will.”</strong></p>



<p>Sanchez said it felt like 20 frames per second and, sometimes, as low as 15. It would happen, he said, doing the “most simple stuff”.</p>



<p>As far as the positives, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sanchez did say that</a> while it doesn’t look as good as PC or PlayStation—as should be expected—it did look “really good”. He also said the tutorial area of the game performed properly.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. A firm release date, however, has yet to be announced. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Callisto Protocol's Goriest Deaths</p>
      </div>
<p>"I don't like when the politics get in the way, which they did with Krafton," he said. "There was no doubt about it. They told me that the game has to ship in December because of the Korean stock market. I should have just shut it down right there. I'm mad of myself on that one."</p><p>Schofield said the PC edition of The Callisto Protocol was a "sh** show."</p><p>The Callisto Protocol launched on December 2, 2022, and Schofield claims Krafton cut off communications with him on December 10. Krafton didn't engage with Schofield again until May 2023, he said.</p><p>The Callisto Protocol was originally envisioned as a horror game set inside the PUBG universe, but the connection to the battle royale game was later dropped. The team behind the game, Striking Distance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-cuts-more-jobs-in-gamings-latest-layoffs/1100-6529696/" data-ref-id="1100-6529696">underwent layoffs after the game was released.</a></p><p>Schofield said The Callisto Protocol sold between 6-7 million copies and "made a lot of money" for a debut title from a new studio. Even if the number was actually 5 million, the game "made its money," Schofield said. For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Krafton management said the game failed to reach sales expecations.</a></p><p>After leaving Striking Distance, Schofield <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-he-might-have-directed-his-last-game-in-the-industry/1100-6533481/" data-ref-id="1100-6533481">attempted to secure funding for multiple other games</a>, but nothing materialized. He's now focusing on his art and writing projects.</p>

                <p>Remember earlier this week when The Pokemon Company put out a teaser image for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-teaser-might-make-you-think-its-switched-genres/1100-6534065/">looked like it could legitimately be from something like the Blair Witch Project</a>? Well, the full trailer is out now, and unsurprisingly it isn't actually all that scary--apart from that one bit with the Espurr. That thing still is terrifying. Still, the trailer is a fun riff on the found-footage genre, and it even revealed a completely new Mega Evolution Pokemon.</p><p dir="ltr">Titled The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident, the trailer follows a couple of people exploring an abandoned building as they come across more and more mysterious happenings. Surprising mirrors, mysterious purple sludge, that titular sweet scent, some Pokemon-oriented jump-scares--all of it builds towards the reveal of Mega Victreebel. And it's looking … large.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyfDz36JkkU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Victreebel's Mega form essentially looks like a giant water balloon with some leaves growing out of it, and it bounces around the place as it moves. Over on the official <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel" rel="nofollow ">Pokemon Legends website</a>, a description explains, "It has so much acid that even closing its mouth tight isn’t enough to hold it in, so it contains the acid by wrapping its own vines around its throat." It certainly paints an uncomfortable picture.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a press release, Mega Victreebel's type stays as grass and poison when it evolves, but details like stat changes likely won't be shared until the game is out.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is releasing October 16 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
