The Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event doesn’t give you new single player challenges to overcome, so don’t worry about putting together that Misty deck you’ve been meaning to build. Instead, this one specifically rewards those who love checking in on their Wonder Pick options throughout the day.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,192995,196663" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s how the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak event works: From now until November 28, a special “Bonus Pick” option will appear in the Wonder Pick menu. <strong>This will let you pick one of five fire-type cards at random for no cost, so you should always take a Bonus Pick whenever you see it</strong>. These can appear several times throughout the day, so make sure to check in on your Wonder Picks whenever you decide to play. At the same time, you’ll occasionally see “Rare Picks” pop up in the Wonder Pick menu, which will feature a fittingly rarer selection of cards. Rare Picks do cost Wonder Stamina, which takes 36 hours to naturally refill.</p><p>Let’s go over what exactly you’ll get here:</p><figure id="" data-id="82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-recommend-id="image://82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-recommend-id="image://82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h168452"><a id="bonus"></a>All Cards You Can Get From Bonus Picks</h2><p>The pool of cards that can appear as Bonus Picks are as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Charmander</strong></p><p><strong>Charmeleon</strong></p><p><strong>Vulpix</strong></p><p><strong>Ninetales</strong></p><p><strong>Ponyta</strong></p><p><strong>Rapidash</strong></p><p><strong>Growlithe</strong></p><p><strong>Magmar</strong></p><p><strong>Heatmor</strong></p><p><strong>Blaine</strong></p></blockquote><p>Again, Bonus Picks are literally free, so even if the cards are all terrible it’d still be worth grabbing. That said, the Charmander, Vulpix, and Ponyta evolution lines can help flesh out Fire decks, especially if you can pair them with a Blaine trainer card.

Arcanine EX is the rarest pick here, but it’s not exactly a “meta” card. 120 damage for three energy can counter Pikachu EX cards that consistently pop up in online matches, so you definitely shouldn’t write it off. That said, you have no actual guarantee of grabbing one given how Wonder Picks work, so you’ll have to weigh whether the risk is worth the reward. You can get a Wonder Hourglass and a Shop Ticket from pulling an Arcanine EX during the event, but that’s more of a nice perk than a reason to chase the card specifically.</p><p>Fortunately, unlike most regular Wonder Picks, your consolation prizes are pretty good here. As alluded to above, Ninetales and Rapidash can be deadly if paired with Blaine. You’ll need Charmeleon if you want to build <em>any</em> Charizard deck. And if you don’t have Charizard or Moltres yet, this is a good opportunity to fill out your collection. <br></p><p>Is it worthwhile to dump all your stored Wonder Hourglasses on Rare Picks whenever you see them? Well, unless you don’t have any of these cards in your collection, you probably don’t <em>need</em> to relentlessly chase these. But is this a good way to use the Wonder Stamina you’ve already stored and are looking to spend? Definitely, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">so long as you don’t get tilted seeing all the cards you wanted more flip over afterwards</a></span>. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But a week after the patch's launch, fan sentiment around the update continues to be mixed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Touted as an ambitious patch that would fix many of the lingering issues from the original release, Reforged 2.0 endured a bug-ridden launch that required multiple hot fixes. Blizzard moved quickly to address problems with graphical glitches, game results failing to register, and the MacOS client breaking entirely, but the issues have tempered enthusiasm for the patch, which Blizzard promoted as a fresh start for one of the most troubled releases in its history.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the major complaints have been claims of discrepancies between the gameplay stills used in the marketing and the actual release. Grubby, a former pro player who remains active in Reforged, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z5IQ21vDGA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was among those who criticized the marketing stills</a>, saying "none of this is real" in a video released earlier this week.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I hope at best this was an oversight and an overreaching by the marketing department that was not signed off by the Warcraft III RTS team. That's the best case scenario," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of publication, the stills remain online on Blizzard's press site, and Blizzard has declined to comment on the discrepancies. In the meantime, Grubby says he's less likely to play with Classic HD settings due to what he perceives to be mouse lag impacting his performance, even as he praised its greater implementation of custom skins.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New art style draws mixed reactions from fans</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from bugs and other issues, AI upscaling has been a hot topic among Warcraft fans. Following the surprise release of remastered versions of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness alongside the Reforged 2.0 updates, fans took to Reddit and other channels with claims that they were hastily upscaled. Blizzard, for its part, has said that the remasters feature "brand new hand-drawn graphics," though it did utilize machine learning to upscale Reforged 2.0's textures and icons in Classic HD mode before refining them by hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/23/wciii-gameplay-stills-undead-1732321174250.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fans have pointed out the discrepancies between Reforged 2.0's screenshots and actual gameplay. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That hasn't stopped fans from criticizing the new art style, though, with some comparing it to the uncanny cartooniness of mobile games. Thankfully, those who don't like the new look of the remasters can hit F5 to go back to the original look. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mixed reactions are in line with Blizzard's recent history with remasters. The original Warcraft III: Reforged did considerable damage to its reputation with fans, failing to deliver on numerous key promises. That reputation lingers to this day, amplifying the overall negativity around Reforged 2.0 even as Blizzard rushes to release hot fixes and updates in a timely manner.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/23/wacraft-remastered-game-stills-2-1732321070766.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The updated art style from the remastered Warcraft releases have drawn mixed reactions from fans. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard, for its part, still has plans to update and optimize Warcraft III: Reforged going forward, and IGN understands that the publisher is also open to exploring ranked multiplayer for the Tides of Darkness remaster if there's enough demand from the community. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grubby, meanwhile, remains fairly optimistic despite his criticism, pointing out that Warcraft III is ultimately a 22-year-old game and arguing for patience. "Despite low expectations, we got all this for free. We got new skins, a new client look, a new ladder with improvements and so on, and while many things still need to be improved, I'm happy with what we got."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read everything else announced during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-everything-announced">last week's Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct right</a> here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review.1043505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a year already chock-full of excellent remakes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review"><u>Persona 3 Reload</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review"><u>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</u></a>, it’s impressive that I can still call Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake one of the best I’ve ever played. That’s not because it sets out to redefine the 1988 NES original like Square Enix did with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review"><u>Final Fantasy VII Remake</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review"><u>Rebirth</u></a>, but because of how it strikes a nearly perfect balance between faithfully sticking to the bones of Dragon Quest III while adding modern quality-of-life improvements and a beautiful new coat of paint that make it more fun than ever to explore and battle across its surprisingly dense overworld. Dragon Quest III is a true godfather of the RPG genre, and this immensely satisfying retelling so clearly spells out why it’s one of gaming’s essential works. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">HD-2D Remake is fundamentally the same adventure Dragon Quest III has always been, and it’s hard not to marvel at how well its original blueprint still holds up in 2024. This is as classic as JRPGs get – the genre boiled down to its absolute essentials of rock-solid turn-based combat, atmospheric caves and dungeons filled with monsters and treasure, and a straightforward story about good versus evil that asks you to fill in a lot of the gaps with your imagination. It evokes nostalgia for a bygone era of video games in the best ways while proving it still has the stuff to hang with the fancy, modern RPGs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the unabashedly old-school design, it does manage to <em>feel </em>new thanks to its overhauled graphics, and Dragon Quest and the HD-2D style pioneered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/octopath-traveler-review"><u>Octopath Traveler</u></a> are an absolute perfect combination. The enemy design is amazing, with highly-detailed sprites and animations that are a joy to look at. The late Akira Toriyama’s signature style is wonderfully realized here, and battles feel more dynamic with each enemy’s lively animations for attacking and defending. Towns are delightful to explore, with stunning castles, houses, and shops that are breathtaking to look at from the outside and adorable to poke around on the inside thanks to sharp attention to detail. The dungeons all look great, too, especially with the moody lighting emitting from your hero’s lantern. Finally, the overworld feels grand to march across, and it’s all backed up with an orchestral soundtrack that fits Dragon Quest’s lighthearted, adventurous mood to a tee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">HD-2D Remake doesn’t just look gorgeous, as it has great battle and class systems to match. Apart from the Hero, whose class and spot in your party is locked in from the start, the composition of the other three spots is completely up to you, including their classes, names, and appearances. I outfitted my party with a Thief, a Priest, and my personal favorite: the all-new Monster Wrangler, who became stronger as I found and recruited friendly monsters across the world, which further incentivized exploration. It’s a ton of fun constructing your band of heroes, and I’m honestly considering a full replay where I try something entirely different given how many classes I didn’t take advantage of. There are also opportunities to reclass later in the story while retaining all the abilities your characters have learned thus far, adding even more important decisions to consider.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>HD-2D Remake doesn’t just look good, it has great battles to match.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s just a shame that the personalities of your party members are all silent, blank slates as a result of that mechanical flexibility. That’s the same as it was in the original, but it makes for an RPG journey that’s much more about character builds, combat, and exploration rather than relationships, camaraderie, and story. It’s completely understandable that Square Enix would stick with the old style in this instance, as it did with almost everything else, but it’s hard not to miss the wonderful personalities of my party in Dragon Quest XI or the Party Chat feature seen in most modern entries of the series by comparison. But as someone who vastly prefers a barebones story compared to an overbearing one, I still thoroughly enjoyed Dragon Quest III’s focus on engaging directly with its RPG systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, the battles themselves are fast-paced, fun, and occasionally quite difficult. Make no mistake – this is still very much a hardcore NES-era RPG, and you need to use a balanced mix of strong attacks, healing spells, and buffing/debuffing abilities to beat some of Dragon Quest III’s toughest bosses. There are some real nail-biting moments, especially later on in the campaign, and I loved using unorthodox strategies to barely squeak by fights I probably wasn’t ready for yet. Random encounters in both the overworld and dungeons are a constant factor, but they’re always enjoyable and drop essential experience points and gold, which you’ll need as much of as you can get to reach the end credits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if nervewracking turn-based battles aren’t your thing, there’s no need to worry. I’m incredibly impressed by how flexible HD-2D Remake is as a whole. Apart from three difficulty options you can switch between at any time (Including the Dracky Quest option, where your characters essentially can’t die), there are a ton of ways to tailor the adventure to your specific playstyle. In combat, you can speed up battle animations to get through encounters faster or watch them at normal speed to really enjoy the detailed enemy animations. You’re also given complete control over how your party behaves: In classic Dragon Quest fashion, you can give individual orders to all four party members, or choose strategies for them to execute on their own, like focusing on healing, conserving magic, or going all-out against a tough foe. It’s honestly relaxing to set the whole party to autobattle when grinding for experience points before taking control back for yourself ahead of an important boss fight. Options like these ensure the great combat remains fresh across the roughly 30-hour adventure, even with multiple sessions of grinding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s partially because the Dragon Quest series is pretty good at making grinding for experience points entertaining, and this remake is no exception. If you’re a fan of the series, you know that Metal Slimes are the key to leveling up fast: Enemies with low spawn rates that drop way more experience points than the average bad guy. Discovering areas of the map where Metal Slimes are more likely to appear is exciting, and the rush of adrenaline that kicks in when you see one show up in a random encounter never gets old – like pulling a rare card from a Pokémon booster pack.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Favorite Remakes</h3><p>I just reviewed Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, and it's one of the best remakes I've ever played. Here are some of my favorites, unranked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, apart from the occasional level grind session, Dragon Quest III’s pacing is impeccable. You’re always being ushered from one new location to the next, constantly exploring new towns and dungeons while encountering fresh foes from the huge set of over 150 enemy types. It rarely retraces any of its steps – except for one specific recurring boss I won’t spoil that admittedly rears its ugly head a few too many times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This remake also goes to great lengths to ensure you’ll never get lost or stuck. The Zoom spell lets you escape a tough situation to rest at an inn pretty much whenever you want, while objective markers clearly label what you need to do next to progress through the occasionally unclear and outdated main quests. However, if you want the classic Dragon Quest III experience, you can turn these quest markers off and discover everything for yourself by exploring and talking to townsfolk. It’s a great system that makes this aged RPG more approachable and playable than ever, while also preserving that original style for those who want it. It’s an ideal way to revisit a beloved adventure, and I love the pace at which this vast world slowly reveals its secrets to you piece by piece.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I love the pace this vast world slowly reveals its secrets to you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While I was generally a big fan of Dragon Quest III’s old-school nature mixed with the HD-2D Remake’s modern improvements, there are a couple of places it could have gone a few extra steps. Inventory management is clunky, as each of your four party members only has access to their individual item bags in combat, meaning I spent a ton of time in menus transferring items from the party’s overall inventory to their individual pockets. Managing equipment comes with similar annoyances, where it’s just a bit harder than it should be to see how equipping something will impact each character’s stats. I eventually got into a rhythm of how to fiddle with these outdated menus, but it’s one place I wish had gotten more updating. (There are also just a few enemy designs that haven’t aged especially well, and probably would have been better left in the past.)</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is the best-case scenario for a faithful remake of a classic roleplaying game, and a shining example for developers to follow when setting out to revisit old, beloved adventures. It spruces up the 36-year-old original with great quality-of-life improvements that enhance the journey without unrecognizably transforming it, along with a beautiful new coat of paint that proves Dragon Quest and the HD-2D art style are a perfect match. But it only works as well as it does because Dragon Quest III is still an incredible RPG in its own right, with great turn-based battles, a highly-adaptable class system, and an intriguing world to uncover that’s littered with secrets. There are only a few areas where I wish it felt a bit more modern, like the clunky inventory management and your party’s lack of personality, but I still respect its unflinching dedication to the original’s vision. Remakes may be all the rage right now, but Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake still confidently stands among the best of them, and is a perfect reminder of why the original is one of the most important RPGs in the genre.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So Dragon Age only had three days of sales reflected in the chart, while most other games on it had significantly more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Piscatella pointed out that EA does not provide Steam data for the best-selling titles charts, so while other games (including Metaphor) had Steam digital sales reflected, Dragon Age's numbers are only for PlayStation and Xbox. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Were Dragon Age: The Veilguard's PC volume included it would have placed higher on the best-selling titles chart — perhaps as high as 3rd overall," he says. "Unfortunately, however, digital sales are included in these specific charts only at the discretion of the publisher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more info, we asked Piscatella if there was any way to compare The Veilguard's launch sales to its Dragon Age predecessors, but Circana's weekly data only goes back to 2018, so no dice there. However, Piscatella did have some analysis to add about how things were going:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just looking at the first days of sales and initial engagement levels via Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, it's been a good - but not great - launch," he said. "Dragon Age: The Veilguard did not reach the launch week sales levels of either Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth or Dragon's Dogma II, and it will be a bit of an uphill battle to reach Inquisition's lifetime sales. But again, it's very early and a lot of the story is left to be told. November will give us a much better read."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we don't have sales numbers for Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Square Enix has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">said they did not meet their internal expectations</a>. Meanwhile, Capcom reported that Dragon's Dogma 2 was a success for them, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-has-done-so-well-capcom-is-paying-out-more-money-to-shareholders">having passed 2.5 million copies sold</a> as of this past April. We do have a bit more comparison context through sales numbers in the UK, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-video-game-sales-jumped-12-in-october-on-the-back-of-blockbuster-launches-european-monthly-charts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Dragon Age: The Veilguard debuted at No.7 on UK sales charts, but its first week sales were over 18% lower than those of Dragon's Dogma 2 and nearly 21% below those of Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave The Veilguard a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">9/10 in our review</a>, writing that it "refreshes and reinvigorates this storied series with enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of companions, and moving character writing."

He told the outlet that while staying at a Hampton Inn outside of Pittsburgh, he tried to take a shortcut to a restaurant down a steep hill instead of walking a “mile and a half down the road.” He lost his footing and rolled down the hill, hitting several rocks on a small dirt path on his way down. As a result of his fall he broke his wrist, lost a fingernail, gave himself a big shiner on his left eye and bruised much of his face. Three hours later, Leno—now wearing an eye patch—did his comedy show as planned, then went to a hospital after arriving back in Los Angeles, he says. </p><p>Jay Leno did in fact fall down a small but steep hill and got injured. That much is true. And if that’s good enough for you, then you can stop reading right now. But I have questions about everything else. </p><h2 id="h171820"><a id=""></a>Questions about Jay Leno’s Fall</h2><p>For starters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inside Edition</em> later reported</a></span> that after his fall, Leno arrived at a restaurant near the hotel called The Boulevard and ordered a chicken parm. The manager of the restaurant told<em> Inside Edition </em>that Leno arrived at the place without a reservation for lunch, ordered the dish with some garlic bread and then left. </p><p>However, The Boulevard is a restaurant located about 750 feet away from the hotel. That’s not <em>too </em>far away, but Leno told <em>Inside Edition</em> he didn’t have a car at the time. (Which is very ironic considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many cars this dude owns</a></span>.) </p><figure id="" data-id="5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-recommend-id="image://5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-format="png" data-width="848" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Leno’s path to the Boulevard from his hotel.

They suggest that Leno was craving some Buffalo wings and took the dirt path that had been cut into the hill by other people taking that same shortcut, didn’t realize how steep it was, and fell. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And this makes sense because in a different interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Leno says that someone at the hotel told him that there was a a good place to eat at “the bottom of this hill.” That sounds like someone pointing Leno to the sports bar at the bottom of the small hill, and not the restaurant up the road for some chicken parm.</p><figure id="" data-id="9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-recommend-id="image://9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-format="png" data-width="950" data-height="690" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path from the hotel to the sports bar located at the bottom of the hill.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adding credence to this theory is the fact after his tumble, Leno visited a local CVS and bought an eye patch, as documented by a worker via a selfie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The nearest CVS is just up the road from the sports bar</a></span>. </p><p>And yet, there’s the small problem that nobody at the sports bar remembers Leno entering and ordering anything that day. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local news site <em>Triblive </em>reports</a></span> that the manager on shift that day doesn’t remember Leno showing up, and nobody he asked could recall seeing the comedian eat some wings. </p><p>So that seems to indicate that the manager at The Boulevard was telling the truth and that Leno walked down to the joint, had some chicken parm, and then left short after falling down the hill and hurting himself. But it’s also possible that someone is trying to spin a good story so a major news outlet will highlight the location for some free publicity.</p><h2 id="h171821"><a id=""></a>What (Probably) Happened, Maybe... </h2><p>I’ve tried to piece together the stories and comments from Leno and everyone else, and I think this is what happened. </p><p>Leno was told he could get some food at a place down the hill from the hotel. He walks out, tries to take a shortcut, and falls. Injured, he likely calls someone (or someone is with him and sees it happen) and they grab a car. </p><p>At this point, someone points out that the restaurant is actually down the road and not in the parking lot near the hotel. So they head over to The Boulevard, Leno orders his chicken parm, eats it, and they drive back up that same road to the CVS at the intersection. He gets what he needs, takes a selfie, and then they continue back on East Pittsburgh street and arrive at the theater so he can do his show. </p><p>Or, Leno got mixed up as to when or where he fell and not everyone remembers what happened clearly and he did eat some wings at that sports bar but nobody noticed because, I mean, how big a star is Jay Leno in 2024? And maybe later Leno had chicken parm at that other place for dinner and the manager is confused about the timing. </p><p>Now I’m going to put away my maps and red string and stop thinking about this. Enjoy your Friday and the rest of the weekend. And be careful walking down hills. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone with kids who play with Lego <em>definitely</em> does. As a parent you don’t think that you’ll step on all the crap your fledgling spawn will leave all over the place, but what you don’t know prior to having kids is how braindead you’ll be most of the time just from having kids. But there are hundreds, possibly even thousands of unique Lego bricks. Which piece can cause the most damage?</p><p>That’s the question YouTuber Nate Scovill (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hackaday</em></a></span>) recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set out to answer</a></span> using a mix of the scientific method and <em>Mythbusters</em>-inspired excess. Scovill crowdsourced info from Lego enthusiasts on Reddit and Discord to narrow down the most potentially painful pieces he should research and then used increasingly elaborate instruments to test them.</p><p>First, Scovill used a series of carboard squares pressed onto the Lego pieces in question to record their “gradient of damage” and used a constructed, weighted arm slapping down on the cardboard to simulate the weight of a foot press. Pointed flames, wizard hats, and retro plastic trees all did some of the worst damage.</p><div><p>Not content to judge using the cardboard alone, Scovill also decided to make an entire foot out of ballistic gel. This would record the damage in more detail, and also allow pieces to become lodged deep inside the material if the simulated accident went that poorly. So what Lego piece actually ended up being the most danagerous?</p><p>One you’ve probably never heard of.

Back before the company’s engineers and manufacturing processes were as high-tech and refined as they are today, there were some Lego pieces that actually relied on metal to complete the connection. These red wheels, if stepped on hard at just the right angle,  bring more than a little <em>Home Alone</em>-style pain. Scovill remarks that you’d probably want to make sure your tetanus shots were up-to-date if you got nailed by one of them. </p></div><p>Fortunately for most of us, the pain of stepping on Lego can be exorcised with a few colorful expletives. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you've been wanting to look into playing Star Citizen,<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/"> the game</a> will be free to play from November 22 through December 5. This is for the premier aerospace event called the annual Intergalactic Aerospace Expo. This event is a celebration of space flight, the vehicles that have been created for doing so, and the important roles they play in the United Empire of Earth. IAE 2954 will be introducing the new <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/iae2954#/schedule/IAE-Academy-2954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAE Academy system</a>, which provides a crash course in spaceflight, with rewards being given to those who complete the tasks set out for them.</p>
<p>To celebrate the upcoming event, a trailer has been uploaded to the official Star Citizen YouTube channel so you can see what to expect from the ambitious event.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Citizen: What is IAE?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoCqee6MpIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once players have completed the new player experience using the Drake Cutter loaner ship, they can then rent any of the available ships so that they can take on the series of missions, which vary from bounty hunting to mining and cargo hauling. By completing these missions, you'll be given in-game UEC, IAE clothing, weapons, and armor to celebrate your success.</p>
<p>Those who attend the show floor will see new ships every day, as the featured manufacturers rotate each day. During the showcase, the manufacturers offer free rentals of their vehicles. Four new ships have been released and are flyable in-game immediately.</p>
<p>During this event, the RSI Polaris will be making its final debut. The RSI Polaris is finally entering full production and will be a flyable ship during this event. Up to 12 crew can fit on the ship, along with a contained mess hall and medbay. There is also a hangar space for a small ship, with a variety of both manned and unmanned weaponry. When it comes to vessels for long voyages, the RSI Polaris is shaping up to be a great one that is full of utility for extended quests and missions.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about the IAE 2954 event, it will be hosted in New Babbage on microTech where new pilots can sign up and play the game for free from November 22 through December 5. This<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/playstarcitizen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> event comes with a full event schedule</a>, which has been posted on the official website, detailing everything you can expect from the event as well as from the manufacturers that will be displaying their ships on the show floor.</p>

                <p>According to a new report, Microsoft has created a "new committee" in its Activision division that will make key decisions about the future of the Call of Duty brand. According to TheGhostOfHope, who has accurately reported on unannounced Call of Duty developments in the past, Microsoft's new committee will listen to suggestions from Call of Duty studios like Treyarch and Infinity Ward, but ultimately the committee will decide "features" and "systems" to come in future games.</p><p>Hope went on to say whether or not a feature like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-dev-hopes-omnimovement-system-becomes-a-call-of-duty-standard/1100-6524179/" data-ref-id="1100-6524179">Omnimovement</a> continues beyond Black Ops 6 will be decided by committee, not by any one studio. The insider went on to say a Call of Duty developers are being told "not to innovate" in "UI, Prestige, and certain gameplay features." Instead, studios are being asked to come up with new directions for things like "maps, modes, and storytelling."</p><p>"That is where they want the creativity to come from," Hope said.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1859722426860401126?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I am being told about the future of Call of Duty:<br>Microsoft has set up a new committee under Activision for Call of Duty that will control "features" &amp; "systems" at the franchise level and let the studios make suggestions.

As for Omnimovement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-dev-hopes-omnimovement-system-becomes-a-call-of-duty-standard/1100-6524179/" data-ref-id="1100-6524179">one of the developers at Treyarch said they hope it becomes a franchise standard going forward.</a></p><p>The reaction to Hope's reporting has been mixed. Some are saying they can understand this way of planning--after all, Microsoft spent $75.4 billion to buy Activision Blizzard and understandably wants a seat at the table. Others are pointing out the pitfalls of designing products "by committee."</p><p>Specifically, some are theorizing that the now-popular Zombies mode could have been cut if the decision came down to a committee. We can never know, of course, but it's true that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-zombies-an-oral-history-of-the-unlike/1100-6442252/" data-ref-id="1100-6442252">Zombies was a last-minute addition to Call of Duty: World at War and almost never happened.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details about this.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-helped-playstation/1100-6527989/" data-ref-id="1100-6527989">breaking records</a>. The Call of Duty series is historically an annualized franchise, and Microsoft has not signaled any change to that plan. As such, fans can expect a new Call of Duty in 2025; reportedly,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's going to be a Black Ops 2 sequel.</a></p><p>For now, though, Activision is focusing on Black Ops 6's seasonal content, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/" data-ref-id="2900-5940">just kicked off with the debut of Season 1 on November 14.</a> The next big release is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-release-date-revealed-for-citadelle-des-morts-map/1100-6527995/" data-ref-id="1100-6527995">Citadelle Des Morts Zombies map in early December.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-twitter-bluesky-growth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the first time in what feels like eons, we’re in the midst of an actual social media upheaval. Twitter is deflating like a balloon animal riddled with holes by the very clown who claims to have molded it, and Bluesky is swooping in to scoop up disaffected users. Recently Bluesky <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/11/20/what-is-bluesky-user-count/76451731007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit 20 million users</a>, and it’s growing at a rate of nearly one million per day. But just as Twitter was once a marginally-enjoyable experience – like Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and YouTube before/after it – Bluesky’s honeymoon period can’t last forever. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we discuss what comes next.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Ryan Broderick of the fantastic <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garbage Day newsletter</a> to discuss all the latest trends in the world of Online. We begin by talking about Bluesky and the potentially fatal blow Twitter has sustained at its hands. Or, more accurately, at Elon Musk’s hands, but Bluesky has far and away been the main beneficiary of Trump’s wannabe baby boy’s bumblings. How long will the good times last, though? Is Bluesky destined to eventually become a massive crock of shit, just like every other social media platform?&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we dig into the myth of The Liberal Joe Rogan and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how actual left-leaning and leftist political influencers are adapting</a> in the wake of an election that decidedly did not go their way. Lastly, we speculate about which specific <em>Fortnite </em>skins a fraudster recently purchased with Nathan’s credit card (hopefully <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as many Gokus</a> as they could get their hands on).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday build a new, better internet from the ashes of the old (or at least buy Threads and immediately shut it down).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I’ve seen a couple larger conversations on and around Bluesky about what it stands to become, and one of them centers around its culture. People are wondering if it will remain intact as the platform scales up, and that one is a little weird to me because – and we’ve talked about this some – the culture you see on a platform like Bluesky is a product of who you’re following. There are many cultures on there, as opposed to a singular monoculture. But I think that maybe the bigger question people are trying to ask when they say that is “As this thing grows into potentially a Twitter replacement culturally if not in terms of size, will it – just by nature of scale and platforms on the modern internet – become a cesspit?” Will it suck shit after a while?</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>I mean, historically, yes. I was just reading the other day about how the earliest Usenet communities almost immediately got a neo-Nazi problem. I think it was on a Behind The Bastards episode where they were talking about how there was a bank robbery to steal computers to set up the first neo-Nazi message boards to network and radicalize Usenet communities. So this is not new. Other than generative AI – which is just a form of spam, which is not new either – none of the problems of the modern internet are particularly new.</p><p>I do think there are moments when the architecture of the modern internet makes it better, and then there are times when it’s worse. The times when it’s better are when the different pockets of the internet are able to communicate but not forced to. And I don’t think that’s a scale issue, actually. I think of it as like biodiversity. In a world with more websites, you don’t feel like you have to use one. I think we can all kind of agree that as Twitter became the only website – and this was earlier for the media than everybody else – but during covid Twitter basically ran the world for, like, nine months. And that’s bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Like, I honestly don’t give a shit what 4chan or 8chan are up to until it becomes, like, a domestic terrorism problem. For the most part, go do whatever you want. I don’t give a shit. It’s when I’m forced to interact with those people and see their content all day, that’s when I get mad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Ryan, did you see when one of the people who works for Bluesky – one of the 20, because they have a very small team – was talking about how they’ve tried to engineer the platform and the business specifically around the idea that the company could wind up becoming the enemy of the future? For example, the company could someday succumb to many of the same problems that Twitter and others have. So they want to build their business and their platform now to be able to be immune to some of those problems – or to ensure that if things get bad, users can take all their data and go somewhere else. Did you see them talking about this?</p><p><strong>Ryan:</strong> I have. I think it’s admirable, but as someone who has had to migrate off a platform, Substack, that made the same promise, and it was a fucking nightmare, I just sort of assume always that they will be the baddie if they live long enough. And that’s fine. We’re all journalists. It just comes with the territory.&nbsp;</p><p>But I like that they’re using that in their story and in their propaganda. I like that open platforms are now cool enough that companies can kind of be facetious about it and be like “Yeah, we’re open.” And it’s like, first of all, Bluesky you’re not open because you’re not even actually on ActivityPub. You had to make your own thing that you own. So let’s pump the brakes here. But I like that they’re leaning into that idea.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>They can’t do it anymore because the site’s too big and everyone knows who they are, but I remember in the early days, [developer] Paul Frazee was a poster’s poster. He was out there letting the trans community on Bluesky mess with him on FaceApp and bully him into trying to become a catgirl. [The Bluesky team] was totally engaged and happy to have this community, and they have wisely I think taken a step back from being shitposters themselves in order to run this place. Because in any good community, there’s always a bit of antagonism toward the mods. I think that’s good for a community. You want to always be a little bit mad at the mods, because then the mods are forced to continually improve the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s only so much you can do to stop capitalism from doing its thing once you start a company or a business.</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>But also, like, we talked about the Tumblr porn ban, and just so we’re all clear, that was because of child pornography on the site. That’s why they did that. Everyone was like “It’s capitalism.” But no, it was a hub for predators.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I talked to a woman for <a href="https://kotaku.com/tumblr-porn-ban-leaves-artists-and-fans-seeking-new-pla-1831056412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a story on Kotaku</a> about the porn ban, and she said she was a victim of revenge porn that was disseminated onto Tumblr. And what she said was interesting: She didn’t think that banning all porn was the answer because she literally could not get an answer from Tumblr when she was trying to get the post of her revenge porn taken down. But she also understood that this move was because Tumblr was becoming a haven for child pornography and revenge porn.</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>And the reason I bring it up is because it was a deeply unpopular decision that people are still mad about to this day, and that is just the nature of one of these platforms. Your most cuddly-wuddly uwu platform will eventually have to do something because of child predators, neo-Nazis, or investors – all the same kind of guy, actually. That is gonna happen. That’s OK. That’s normal, to have those antagonistic relationships with your admin or your mods. That’s their job.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Another year, another Call of Duty, and that’s still not a bad thing. Activision has been generous enough to provide a sort of shared experience between games, permitting select DLC and weapons to carry over between titles, typically into the Warzone mode. As the first Black Ops title in four years, Activision and Treyarch have gone to show whether that wait has been worth it in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-BO6-Report.png"></a></figure>

<p>The setting this time takes a few steps in the timeline from the end of the Cold War leading up to the early 90’s and some of the Operations that defined American childhood. If not for the vignettes between campaign missions or the constant referencing of military conflicts in the background, the mood and setting of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> could easily fall anywhere between the Apollo moon missions and the turn of the millennium. One of the spy-centric missions has players infiltrate the inauguration of the 42nd U.S. President, Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 treats espionage with all of the finesse of a sledgehammer. With one notable example where breaking incognito will actively end the mission, going loud or doing an offensive job at trying to maintain stealth doesn’t really have any real negative impacts on the mission. In proper Call of Duty fashion, nearly any scene can turn into a proper gunfight if the player doesn’t want to slink around with intent. There are a few moments when the game attempts to reign in the gungho nature of the military shooter by forcing the player to investigate an enemy base and approach the mission goal in a number of ways.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6-Clinton.png"></a></figure>

<p>There are only a few moments where players won’t assume the role of Case and instead take control of one of the other antiheroes and Sev’s mission is one of the most notable for how simple it is: breaking into a military base controlled by one Pantheon, the big bad that makes up Black Ops 6’s boogeymen. Her mission objective is to disable three key military installations, but the player is given a number of ways to approach it (with the old failsafe of just bringing them all down with some explosive charges). The enemy AI is relatively dull, and only the most overt actions will alert them, giving the player some leeway into trying to sweet-talk a guard into letting them pass or knocking out a guard and stuffing them into a conveniently placed locker. Call of Duty Black Ops 6 ebbs and flows the narrative by inserting these spy missions in between the series’ signature combat corridors, and the pacing works all the better for it.</p>
<p>The nameless, faceless protagonist Case is probably one of the worst playable gunslingers in the Call of Duty universe and merely exists as a punching bag through so many missions in the eight-hour campaign. To permit Sev, Adler, and the other crew members to complete their tasks, they routinely sacrifice Case to get captured, choked, and nearly killed on more instances than I can count. The narrative opens with newcomer Marshall assuming they would be the protagonist of the campaign, only for the mute Case to go front and center (sure, there are dialogue trees to chat with your party members between missions, but you never get to hear Case utter a single word or combat bark). Sadly, the campaign ends on a rather abrupt note with the all-too-familiar tease for a sequel (or most likely a seasonal event in Warzone).</p>

<p>One story moment that I need to give Treyarch kudos to is in the few puzzles scattered around the campaign. Inside The Rook (the main hub and base of command between story missions) lie some KGB artifacts that require the player to go through some in-depth puzzle-solving to accomplish. By the time I jumped into the campaign at launch, players had already figured out the solutions to the rewards hidden in The Rook but jumping into the scavenger hunt blind is the best way to experience it. Grabbing a blacklight and venturing into the basement is only the start of this fantastic treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Differentiating Black Ops 6 from prior Call of Duty titles comes in the adjusted movement and traversal abilities in something Treyarch has dubbed Omnimovement. While jumping forward and diving is nothing new for the series, dolphin diving only really worked to evade forwards. What Omnimovement brings to the table is the same expanded movement, but in any direction, like playing out the good bits of a John Woo action scene. In proper multiplayer, expect to deal with many folks diving sideways through doors or sliding right into your shins when you least expect.</p>

<p>In proper Treyarch fashion, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 has three signature pillars: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While MWZ was an enjoyable way to introduce zombies and persistent missions into the open-world Warzone, players have been calling for round-based zombies for years now. Treyarch have outdone themselves here with two zombies campaigns that continue the ongoing narrative of Richtofen and Dark Aether experiments. Whether you’re in the mood for bowling and comic book collecting in Liberty Falls Americana or breaking out of a Pacific military camp, both experiences provide different takes on the zombies formula. By the time you’re reading this review, Treyarch will have already released the Guided Modes, giving players an easier time figuring out how to accomplish the easter eggs in each map while restricting the round cap, preventing zombies from overpowering players who don't farm up enough currency to hit up the local Pack-a-Paunch machines.</p>

<p>Multiplayer really brings no surprises to the table, as players already know what Call of Duty’s multiplayer is all about. Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Headquarters, Hardpoint, Search and Destroy and many more make up the bulk of Black Ops 6’s core multiplayer offerings. New to the rotation is Kill Order, another 6v6 team deathmatch mode that sticks one player on each team as the MVP as each side rushes to reach 125 points. Killing the MVP awards two points and forces another player to spawn in and take the mantle while achieving kills as the MVP awards five points. At its core, the mode is Team Deathmatch, but the added point bonuses incentivize players to take a slightly different approach to the frontlines.</p>
<p>It took Treyarch and Activision a few weeks to roll out the DLC campaign for Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and the offerings here are all too familiar for the other titles ever since Activision launched the Call of Duty HQ. Premium character skins, emotes, weapon packs, and the like are around as always with purchases made carrying over into the cross-title Warzone. The typical Battle Pass also returns with players progressing through set pages in order (unless they purchase a skip to let them jump ahead to a different page). It’s simpler than the map layout in Modern Warfare III, but all roads lead to the same outcome of a plethora of sprays and stickers most players won’t use and only a handful of worthwhile weapons and character skins.</p>
<p><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</p>

<div>
		<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Pros</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Spy thriller campaign takes a different approach to the standard CoD campaign and pulls off some ambitious set pieces
</li><li>High contrast is great for accessibility as well as making Zombies mode easier to pick out targets (feature is blocked for Multiplayer)
</li><li>Combat Specialties give temporary wallhacks when respawning among others
</li><li>Pick 10 is gone, replaced with five attachments per weapon (unless using a perk)
</li><li>Omnimovement brings something uniquely different to the multiplayer</li>		</ul>

			<span>Cons</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Campaign ends just as it's getting good
</li><li>Omnimovement brings something uniquely frustrating to the multiplayer
</li><li>Map design built for camping with blind corners everywhere
</li><li>Still no platinum trophy on PS4 due to how Call of Duty HQ is designed
</li><li>Bullet penetration on Nuketown and similar small-sized maps is mental</li>		</ul>
