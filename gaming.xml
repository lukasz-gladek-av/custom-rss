		<p>Tomorrow, December 3rd 2024, will be exactly thirty years since the launch of the original PlayStation and no doubt Sony have a few treats up their sleeves, but they’re kicking things off with a heart-warming video.</p>
<p>It features many classic PlayStation games backed up with an epic remix of Linger by The Cranberries.</p>


<p>“For the past three decades, we’ve shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together. Along the way, we’ve found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We’ve forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey — we couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>

			<p>Two years after the PC launch and one year after the Xbox launch, Fatshark is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-is-coming-to-ps5-next-month-will-run-at-4k60fps-on-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing</a> for the launch of Warhammer 40K Darktide <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP4122-PPSA21255_00-0888672453602469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PlayStation 5</a>. The PS5 debut is scheduled for Thursday, but tomorrow, the studio will also <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktides-free-update-releases-december-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> the Grim Protocols free update that adds a new endgame mode, a new mission, three new weapon families, a dedicated event for the second anniversary, and even a few quality of life enhancements.</p>
<p>Despite the busy time at the Swedish studio, Fatshark was kind enough to let us have a chat with Chief Technology Officer Mikael Hansson. We discussed the PlayStation 5 launch, the studio's experience with the PS5 Pro hardware, and whether the game will support ray tracing on the enhanced console or cross-progression across all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zWWPeN3lWG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why did it take so long for Darktide to get on PlayStation 5? Was there an exclusivity deal in place with Microsoft?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! It was no secret that we had an exclusivity deal in place with Microsoft extending for a certain period of time after the Darktide Xbox release. That said, this exclusivity window had expired long before the release date of Darktide on PS5. The current PS5 launch date of December 3rd is the result of the development team establishing a robust timeline by the end of which we could have a solid PS5 version of the game ready.</p>
<p><strong>You confirmed that the PS5 version will launch with cross-play. Was it complicated to set up with the other platforms? Also, would you consider adding cross-progression?</strong></p>
<p>The most complicated parts of launching with cross-play support for PS5 were handled during the initial stage of Darktide as a project. We decided quite early not to rely on any platform-specific networking solutions. This work enabled us to deliver crossplay for Xbox and Steam and is what allows us to seamlessly integrate PS5 into our environment as well.</p>
<p>Most of the technical challenges are fairly similar from one platform to another, such as supporting various parental control features and the ability to opt out of crossplay. Here, Steam stands out a bit as it does not require any such features to be supported. As for cross-progression, we are not currently planning to introduce it to Darktide.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that the PS5 version is getting haptic feedback. Can you share for which events/actions? Also, any chance you'll be adding support for adaptive triggers, too?</strong></p>
<p>The haptic feedback is implemented for a variety of actions related to weapon handling and character abilities, as well as for some environmental effects and events. The feeling of blasting heretics with a full auto Recon Lasgun or revving the Chainsword are particular favorites. And yes, the adaptive triggers do play a big part in tying this all together. This work will make it in time for the wider launch of Darktide on PS5 and its Grim Protocols update on December 3rd.</p>
<p><strong>Would you update the PC version so that DualSense controller users can get haptic feedback on this version as well?</strong></p>
<p>The PC version support for DualSense controllers with haptic feedback is not something we are currently working on at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>How long did it take for you to enhance Darktide for the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p>Once the bulk of the work to bring Darktide to PS5 was nearing completion, enhancing Darktide for PS5 Pro was relatively easy. We already supported features like DLSS/FSR/XESS on PC, so adding PSSR didn’t require too much work. Now, we have more horsepower to get players blasting heretics with bigger frames and faster.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What is the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>The addition of PSSR is definitely a game changer to get those frame rates up while keeping the image quality as good as possible. That said, PSSR is not purely hardware related so I would have to say that the beefier GPU is the single hardware feature that left us really impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro- PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>The difference between PS4 - PS4 Pro is more significant hardware wise than the PS5 - PS5 Pro. That said, that leap had both benefits and disadvantages. The PS4 Pro enjoyed more CPU and RAM compared to the PS5 Pro’s GPU increase. The problem is that, in order to fully use that extra hardware, a developer needed to do so much more than when working on generating more frames at a higher resolution. Adding too many/vastly different pieces of hardware might incur the different “generations” to diverge more than one would like, which could result in a game being bottlenecked by the slower of the two consoles.</p>
<p>We had this problem with Vermintide 2, where consoles couldn’t push as many enemies as the PC version could. This caused us to have vastly different enemy numbers and the games were tweaked differently on each platform, which prevented crossplay from being a thing for Vermintide 2. The PS4 Pro solved this problem to an extent, but since we need to support all players, including PS4 users who experienced technical limitations, we were never able to fully utilize all that extra horsepower.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Havoc Endgame Mode | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUzMxKl9qqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How much faster does the PS5 Pro hardware run your engine compared to the PS5?</strong></p>
<p>It is really hard to put a number on this, but fast enough for us to be able to hit a comfortable 60 FPS in PSSR-enhanced 4K.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are using PSSR, likewise, we have NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS all integrated on PC as well. It’s really hard to compare as we cannot run PSSR and any of the other alternatives on the same platform and hardware. From what we have seen so far PSSR seems to be able to slug it out with the best of them and provide the expected benefit for the game.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Does the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro version runs PSSR-assisted 4K at 60fps with most settings in what would equal PC High mode. We are running PSSR in the balanced mode equivalent, which puts the internal resolution at 2258x1270.</p>
<p><strong>The Xbox Series X version of Darktide does not support ray tracing, so I expect the same will be true for PS5. The new PS5 Pro adds enhanced ray tracing capabilities, though. Were you able to port any ray-tracing features from the PC version?</strong></p>
<p>We did not put focus on porting any of the raytracing solutions on PC to PS5 or PS5 Pro for that matter. The cost versus benefit wasn’t deemed favorable. Darktide already looks pretty darn good even without raytracing features and our focus for PS5 Pro was to deliver the 60fps performance at the PS5 quality mode equivalent. We just find that the prospect of additional frames appeals to Darktide players more than the addition of slightly better looks.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

Yeah, you know the one.</p><p>For a limited time, players can customize their PS5 UI using themes from throughout PlayStation’s past. Choose a theme from any of the four previous PlayStation consoles and a special 30th anniversary theme.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Season 1</a> is about to get a fresh mid-season update filled with new content. As with every major update for the free-to-play battle royale, the update will not only bring new weapons and events, but players can also expect huge buffs and nerfs to shuffle the meta.</p>



<p>The update comes during the Holiday season, so if you’re looking to dive into Warzone over the Christmas period, here’s when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a> is expected to drop.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-new-weapons-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-ranked-play-arrives-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">Ranked Play arrives in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-expected-content">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded expected content</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded release date</h2>



<p>The Warzone Season 1 Reloaded update will arrive on <strong>December 5, 2024</strong>, at around <strong>10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Although it has not yet been confirmed, we are confident in this date as Treyarch announced that the new Zombies map for Black Ops 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a>, would arrive on December 5. In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, this new map was confirmed to be released with the mid-season update, so we expect it to coincide with the official Season 1 Reloaded patch.</p>

<h2 id="h-new-weapons-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<ul>
<li>Maelstrom</li>



<li>AMR Mod 4</li>



<li>Cleaver</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maelstrom</a> is a new Shotgun arriving in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded, while the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-amr-mod-4-sniper-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMR Mod 4</a> is a semi-automatic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Rifle</a> that packs a mean punch. Players will also be able to get the Cleaver, a new Melee Weapon. </p>



<p>All three of these weapons will be available via an event, similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-power-drill-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Drill</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a>. We don’t yet know what this event is, but considering the update is arriving in the Holiday season, perhaps it will be Christmas-themed. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see exactly how players unlock these new weapons when the event rolls around in Season 1 Reloaded.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-ranked-play-arrives-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">Ranked Play arrives in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<p>As promised by the devs, <strong>Ranked Play will return in Warzone with the Season 1 Reloaded update</strong>. It was removed after the Black Ops 6 integration in Season 1, but the devs are reintroducing it at the halfway point of the season.</p>



<p>The Ranked Play format will likely be very similar to what it was prior to the BO6 integration. Just like in multiplayer, players will earn Ranked Points by playing well and placing high. You will climb up Skill Divisions and earn exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-ranked-play-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play rewards</a> depending on the level you reach – Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players have been enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play in multiplayer</a>, but it’s time for battle royale players to have their own competitive fun.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-expected-content">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded expected content</h2>



<ul>
<li>New guns</li>



<li>New events</li>



<li>Ranked Play</li>



<li>Buffs and nerfs</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of new guns, events, and Ranked Play, we also expect Warzone Season 1 Reloaded to bring some hefty buffs and nerfs for the game’s weapons and equipment. Major updates often bring meta-shifting balance changes, but we won’t receive the official patch notes detailing these tweaks until closer to the update.</p>

                <p>In October, Microsoft announced that Xbox games would soon be sold in a new place--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-will-soon-be-sold-in-a-new-place/1100-6527117/" data-ref-id="1100-6527117">directly from the Xbox app on Android</a>.

"Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision," Bond said.</p><p>This all stems back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-will-soon-be-sold-in-a-new-place/1100-6527117/" data-ref-id="1100-6527117">a decision in the Epic v.

Epic's Tim Sweeney spearheaded the initiative in his ongoing battle against Google and its business practices.</p><p>Google said at the time that it planned to appeal, and the company succeeded in convincing a judge to at least delay the decision. It remains to be seen when the stay could be lifted.</p><p>Epic, which created the massively popular Fortnite, convinced the court that Google made it very difficult for any rival store within Google Play to successfully compete in the market. The benefit to Microsoft is that it can sell games directly to consumers via its own store inside the Xbox app, and that also means Microsoft wouldn't need to pay Google a fee.</p><p>Beyond selling games within the Xbox app for Android, Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-pushing-ahead-with-plans-for-mobile-game-store-which-isnt-multiple-years-away/1100-6519625/" data-ref-id="1100-6519625">aiming to launch its own entire mobile game store at some point in the future.</a> Microsoft is no longer trying to sell everyone an Xbox console but is instead positioning the Xbox as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">catch-all term for any device that has Game Pass. </a></p><p>Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass</a> to create more subscribers that in turn provide Microsoft with a regular and recurring revenue stream.

Sony has rolled out a special limited-time console update for your PS5 which adds a suite of nostalgia-fuelled custom sounds and startup options. 
</p>
<p>
In essence, it makes your PS5 look and sound more similar to Sony's greats of yesteryear: the PS1! the PS2! the PS3! the PS4! And no PS Vita.
</p>
<p>
Turn on your console now and, if updated, you'll be greated by the option to choose your favourite console generation. This adds a themed swirl to your PS5 desktop based around the look and feel of Sony's past consoles.

There's even a thank you message when shutting down or restarting your console, congratulating players for being part of Sony's journey.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-history-of-indiana-jones-video-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you go by last year’s finalists for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards, there are indie games, and there are “indie” games. That is, there are independent games financed and made by individuals or teams free from the influence of a major publisher, and there are “independent” games that are… actually owned by billion-dollar South Korean corporations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you’re not interested in the debate about what can be named an indie game and what can’t, there is a <em>third</em> type of Indy game, and <em>they</em> are named after a dog.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-fond-memories-1732678475338.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"I got a lot of fond memories of that dog."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After well over 10 years since his last dedicated digital adventure, Indiana Jones is returning to video games in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which is arriving imminently on PC, Xbox, and Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how did we get here? Well, Indiana Jones games may have otherwise dried up over the past decade-and-change, but <em>before</em> that, the good Doctor Jones’ video game history dates back over 40 years. So kick back as we dust off some antique hardware and whip through the history of Indiana Jones games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">First created by George Lucas back in the early ’70s, Indiana Jones – originally conceived as Indiana <em>Smith</em> – was heavily inspired by the adventure serials of Lucas’ youth, and the character’s trademark look took a heavy dose of inspiration from the likes of Alan Ladd in the 1943 film China, Humphrey Bogart in 1948’s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Charlton Heston in Secret of the Incas from 1954.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a surname shift, Indiana Jones was brought to life by Harrison Ford on the big screen in one of the most magnificent action adventure movies ever made: 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. As you almost certainly already know, Raiders of the Lost Ark was followed by two absolutely outstanding films and two… other films.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-nasty-1732678614048.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Now you're getting nasty."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What you may <em>not</em> know, however, is where Indiana Jones made his very first appearance on the small screen. The answer is Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari 2600. It was created by legendary Atari game designer Howard Scott Warshaw, the man behind Yars’ Revenge – the best-selling first-party game ever on the console. Raiders of the Lost Ark hit the Atari 2600 in late 1982, around a year-and-a-half after the film had arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only first played my dad’s 2600 <em>later </em>in the ’80s, and about all I remember is instantly bouncing off anything more obtuse than Outlaw, which is a game with a premise that begins and ends at “shoot the cowboy on the other side of the TV.” Despite my unequivocal love of all things Indy, Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari was not my type of thing. Looking at it through a modern lens, however, it is certainly a fascinatingly complex and ambitious Atari 2600 game – even if it is confusing and more than a little unfair. Come on, snakes the same colour as the ground?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-2600-1732678774966.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1982's Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the Atari 2600.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a strictly single-player experience, it required the use of both the console’s joystick controllers to operate. The right joystick moves Indy around the limited assortment of screens, and the left stick allows players to navigate their inventory and select the object you want Indy to use. Of course, utilising both controllers came with the benefit of DOUBLING the amount of buttons players had at their disposal. Twice the buttons!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-just-the-two-1732678893770.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"It was just the two."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, yes, Indy is correct: Atari 2600 controllers only have one button, so yep, it was just the two. However, don’t assume Raiders of the Lost Ark is simple on account of having such a limited spectrum of controls. Rather, it’s anything but. With the benefit of hindsight and the fact that the effective route through this game has long since been charted, Raiders of the Lost Ark’s arcane gameplay seems almost quaint in 2024 – but how exactly contemporaneous audiences were meant to blunder their way upon these ambiguous but awfully specific puzzle solutions is a total mystery.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How exactly contemporaneous audiences were meant to blunder their way upon these ambiguous but awfully specific puzzle solutions is a total mystery.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Raiders of the Lost Ark holds the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/88979-first-videogame-based-on-an-official-movie-licence" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Guinness World Record as the first-ever video game based on an official movie licence</u></a>. It would seem it just pipped Alien from Fox Video Games, which also came out in November 1982, although that was literally just a Pac-Man clone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, that, and that <em>other</em> alien movie tie-in for the Atari 2600 from December 1982: E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Coincidentally, E.T. was actually <em>also</em> designed by Howard Scott Warshaw (at the request of Steven Spielberg himself, no less), though he only had five weeks to make it. Of course, that’s a story for a <em>different</em> documentary.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-see-this-priceless-1732678989803.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"I take it, I bury it in the sand for a thousand years; it becomes priceless."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next video game would be his first original one: Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, which was released by Mindscape for the Commodore 64 in late 1984. It features a… pretty nifty arrangement of John Williams’ unforgettable theme music, but very little else worth celebrating, depending on how much mileage you reckon you’d get out of a constipated cowboy turning birds into butterflies with an apparently enchanted walking stick. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-lost-kingdom-1732679499488.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1984's Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, for Commodore 64.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s box boasted that "Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you." It wasn’t quite true – <a href="https://archive.org/details/commodore-power-play-15/page/n33/mode/1up?view=theater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>there was actually a clue hotline for stumped players</u></a> to call and be told how to proceed – but either way it feels like Mindscape was putting a lot of stock in the cognitive powers of the youth of the ’80s here. I was there, and I can’t exactly vouch for it, but maybe that was just the palookas I hung around with back then.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-not-one-brain-1732679266588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"They have not one brain among them."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next official movie tie-in came with August 1985’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arcade game, which arrived a little over a year after the movie. Also developed by Atari, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was instantly a huge step up over its Atari 2600 predecessor – and not simply because Indiana Jones no longer looked like a tiny UFO floating over a fire hydrant. The Temple of Doom arcade game was a very early example of digitised speech in video games – something that had only just started in Atari’s 1983 Star Wars arcade game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/temple-of-doom-arcade-1732679647638.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1985's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, for arcades.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With his iconic whip, players were required to hustle their way through Mola Ram’s lair, freeing captured children, avoiding spike traps, and defeating cultists and creatures. A mine cart level obviously made an appearance, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Versions of Temple of Doom eventually made their way to home devices like the Commodore 64 and the NES but, as was generally the case during the golden age of arcades, the home versions looked and played like vastly inferior knock offs of the real thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1987, Mindscape returned with yet <em>another </em>original Indiana Jones game that flaunted the series’ naming conventions by switching the “and the” for a much clumsier “in”: Indiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients. It was a text adventure, so Mindscape wasn't just going back in time for Indy’s story matter – it was going back in time for its game design, too. Do you want to hear about it?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-not-at-all-1732679741253.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Not at all."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, good, because that brings us to quite a busy little period for Indiana Jones games, kicking off around the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which is frankly the most perfect movie ever made and, no, I won’t be taking any questions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade actually inspired <em>three </em>separate games released between 1989 and the early ’90s. One of those was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game, first published on PCs in 1989 by Lucasfilm Games, which was later renamed LucasArts, and then later still, Lucasfilm Games again. Versions of the game eventually made their way to approximately every other platform on Earth in the early ’90s. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-action-1732680355798.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game, for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, no version of the game was very good and, considering Indiana Jones is supposed to be a teenager in the scene depicted in the above screenshot, the understanding of the movie some versions displayed was rudimentary at best.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/doom-insulting-1732680574031.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"You're insulting them, and you're embarrassing me."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, be that as it may, it’s hard to get too misty eyed about The Action Game when it was so thoroughly outclassed by its own stablemate, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure. While Lucasfilm Games had outsourced the development of The Action Game to a long-defunct studio called Tiertex, The Graphic Adventure was developed by Lucasfilm Games itself, and was the third game to run on the studio’s now famous SCUMM engine – after Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders. Point-and-click adventure games have always been Lucasfilm Games’ bread and butter, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure remains a fine example of its work.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-graphic-1732682035503.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure, from 1989.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Led by adventure game legend Ron Gilbert of Monkey Island fame, The Graphic Adventure sticks far more closely to the events of the film, though it still finds room to colour outside the lines of the script with sequences that allow Indy to talk his way around Nazi encounters if you’re canny enough. Or, you can just punch Hitler right in his goddamn face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are definitely some quality of life issues present in The Last Crusade that later Lucasfilm point-and-click games would go on to iron out, but there’s no denying the tremendous attention to detail the team managed to squeeze into it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-taito-1732682148005.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1991's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, published by Taito.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The third game based on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a NES-exclusive action game from Taito, which was distinct from “<em>The</em> Action Game”, but <em>did </em>mean there were literally two Last Crusade tie-ins available on NES published out of opposite sides of the planet. For reference, you can recognise the Taito one via Indy’s high-kicking martial arts skills, as it appears Harrison Ford has been replaced with Jean Claude Van Damme. But hey, I guess I love Kickboxer and Bloodsport as much as the next guy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-complaining-1732682199921.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Then what are you complaining about?"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, nothing, I guess, although the topic of recasting Harrison Ford does bring us neatly to 1993’s The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles by Chris Gray Enterprises, Incorporated, and 1994’s Instruments of Chaos starring Young Indiana Jones from the less enterprising but equally incorporated Brian A. Rice, Incorporated. The former was a NES exclusive, and the latter was only available on Sega Genesis, which went by the slightly cooler ‘Sega Mega Drive’ in Japan and Europe, the accidentally mispronounced ‘See-ga Mega Drive’ in Australasia, and the… very different ‘Super Aladdin Boy’ in South Korea. No, that’s not made up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/young-indy-sega-1732683532535.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1994's Instruments of Chaos starring Young Indiana Jones, for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, in keeping with the TV show that aired between ’92 and ’93, Harrison Ford was, in fact, replaced with Sean Patrick Flanery – at least for the box art. The platforming action in each, however, was not particularly fun or memorable enough for either of them to be much more than a footnote in Indiana Jones’ gaming history. Certainly not fun or memorable enough to ignore the magnificent game we just skipped: 1992’s legendary Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis finds Indy in a race against time to beat the Nazis to the lost underwater city of Atlantis. Directed by Hal Barwood, the game had initially been intended to be based on a sidelined Indiana Jones script written by Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire director Chris Columbus prior to The Last Crusade. However, Barwood – who himself had earlier co-written Steven Spielberg’s first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express – petitioned to create an original story for it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-fate-atlantis-1732683670616.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, from 1992.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Barwood collaborated with The Last Crusade co-designer Noah Falstein, who introduced the concept of having three different routes through the game’s story: The Wits Path, which focuses on a more cerebral challenge, the Fists Path, which is a more action-oriented, Hollywood experience with lighter puzzles, and the Team Path, where Indy remains with his partner Sophia Hapgood to solve puzzles together. These paths would branch away after the first act, though they would converge again towards the end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Fate of Atlantis is not only regarded as one of the studio’s best-ever adventure games – it’s one of the best adventure games of all time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Representing LucasArts at around the peak of its point-and-click power, The Fate of Atlantis is not only regarded as one of the studio’s best-ever adventure games – it’s one of the best adventure games of all time. That said, it’s hard to say whether it would have been the same smash hit with the name the suits reportedly <em>wanted</em> to give it, which was simply “Indy’s Next Adventure.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-fools-1732683739962.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Bureaucratic fools!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As with The Last Crusade, LucasArts simultaneously published an entirely redundant second version of the Fate of Atlantis: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game, which was developed by Attention to Detail, slightly before it briefly hit the big time with the futuristic Rollcage racing series. With its isometric view and its finicky and frankly awful controls, Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game was actually a far poorer action game than the platformers that had preceded it. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-fate-atlantis-action-1732683852882.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game, from 1992.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A CD version of the Graphic Adventure arrived in 1993 with full voice acting, but unfortunately a planned follow-up called Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix was cancelled – although the game’s story was still actually published in a limited Dark Horse comic series from December 1994 to March 1995.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, while Indiana Jones’ graphic adventures were wrapping up on PC, SNES owners were in for one final taste of Indiana Jones’ greatest adventures in Indiana Jones’… Greatest Adventures. Released in late 1994 in North America and mid-1995 in Japan and PAL territories, Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures is a Super Star Wars-style side scroller that encompasses the events of all three original films. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-greatest-adventures-1732683966889.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Factor 5's Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, released in 1994–95.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Factor 5 – which would go on to develop a string of Star Wars games with LucasArts, including the Rogue Squadron series – Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures features a horde of familiar locations from the movies, some seriously impressive Mode 7 sequences to break up the platforming action, and well balanced combat split between Indy’s whip, pistol, and grenades. Sure, it was harder than a woodpecker’s lips, and sure it took a few detours to accommodate some genre-typical boss battles – particularly since Indiana Jones villains in the films have a habit of literally killing themselves – but Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures is a much-loved segment of the Indiana Jones gaming tapestry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-tapestries-1732684050945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Tapestries?"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Less beloved was the peculiar 1996 PC game Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures, which was led by Fate of Atlantis creator Hal Barwood but was an entirely different sort of adventure game. With its budget price and retro RPG aesthetic – even for the mid-’90s – Desktop Adventures was officially designed for a more casual audience to idly play in windowed mode while they were doing other tasks, and its procedurally generated approach promised “literally billions of possible games,” as per an enthusiastic claim on the game’s box art. One mission even had Indy retrieving the head of C-3P0. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-c3po-1732684228833.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This Easter egg was later re-referenced in 2008's LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this casual take on Indy-themed adventuring was not exactly welcomed by critics. Thanks in no small part to LucasArts’ existing reputation as the home of genre-leading adventure games, Desktop Adventures’ low-fi and frictionless approach was met with an inauspicious reaction. It also probably didn’t help that 1996 also saw the debut of Tomb Raider, a 3D adventure more cutting edge than Lara Croft’s tank top. Though she was certainly inspired by Indiana Jones, Lara rapidly rose to become a certified cultural icon herself. Indiana Jones had some archaeological competition, and she was more than happy to muscle Indiana out of the equation. Indeed, 1999’s Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation even had an Easter egg of Indiana Jones’ skeleton – complete with a fedora and a whip.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-trying-to-kill-us-1732684312693.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Those people are trying to kill us!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones finally entered the third dimension himself in 1999’s Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine for PC – which, coincidentally enough – is about an ancient Babylonian device that facilitates interdimensional travel. Again directed by Hal Barwood, The Infernal Machine is a third-person action adventure heavily informed by Core’s early Tomb Raider games. Run. Jump. Pull blocks. <em>Push</em> blocks. Lara may have begun life as an Indy imitator, but now Indy was looking at Lara, and copying her every move. Puzzles weren’t particularly taxing, though performing them sometimes was with the somewhat cumbersome controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 1947, The Infernal Machine benched the series’ normal Nazi baddies in favour of Soviets instead, who are intent on harnessing the power of the titular Infernal Machine and its interdimensional properties for an edge in the quickly escalating Cold War. It did, however, bring back Sophia Hapgood from The Fate of Atlantis, which was a neat touch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-infernal-machine-1732684376376.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1999's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, for PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Infernal Machine was initially set to receive a PlayStation port, but it was cancelled. An N64 version did make it into the wild in 2000, albeit exclusively in the US, and it was only available to purchase via the LucasArts company store, or purchase or rent from Blockbuster. You know, the stores that used to let you borrow games for a small fee, before that beautiful concept was sacrificed in order to let people stream Is It Cake? directly to their phones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The N64 version was <em>supposed</em> to make its way to PAL territories but after numerous delays that was eventually cancelled. There was also a top down handheld version of Infernal Machine released in 2001, although it unfortunately arrived on the Game Boy Color just as the Game Boy Advance was arriving to replace the Game Boy Color.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-museum-1732684464910.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"That belongs in a museum!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next adventure came in 2003, courtesy of The Collective, a team fresh off 2002’s Xbox exclusive Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Taking place in 1935, Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb was actually a prequel to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arriving first on the original Xbox, then PC, then several months later on PS2, the Emperor’s Tomb remained relatively Tomb Raider adjacent, but it dialled back the brainteasers and block puzzles in favour of lever hunting and light platforming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Emperor’s Tomb was also considerably more combat oriented, with a brawling system borrowed directly from Buffy and the ability to use items lying around the world as weapons, including chairs and broken table legs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Emperor’s Tomb had all the core ingredients of a robust Indy adventure, including magnificent music, nefarious Nazis, and a typically powerful ancient artefact the Nazis want.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Emperor’s Tomb had all the core ingredients of a robust Indy adventure, including magnificent music, nefarious Nazis, and a typically powerful ancient artefact the Nazis want – in this case, the Heart of the Dragon, a perfect black pearl legend says can control the hearts of men. However, it also packed a few surprises, including an appearance by an enormous dragon and a showdown with a huge kraken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here I was thinking the only crackin’ involving Indy was the sound his whip made. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-emperors-tomb-1732684601305.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2003's Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, for Xbox, PC, and eventually PS2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">LucasArts began work on a follow-up to The Emperor’s Tomb in 2004, destined for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, both of which were set to arrive in late 2005 and late 2006 respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were treated to a first glimpse of the game in a quirky tech-focused teaser trailer which LucasArts used to illustrate some of the advancements it was promising under the hood. It was actually our first look at the animation middleware Euphoria, the biomechanical AI that would go on to hit the big time in 2008’s Grand Theft Auto IV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, work on the much-anticipated project faltered, and the game missed its planned 2007 release. To make matters worse for LucasArts, Naughty Dog had also decided to join them in the archaeological arena with November 2007’s Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune for PlayStation 3, the first outing for the now iconic PlayStation hero Nathan Drake.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-competitor-good-1732684713467.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"A competitor. He was good. He was very, very good."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Indiana Jones project continued for a time, and in the interim LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures from Traveller’s Tales arrived in June 2008, just after the arrival of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in cinemas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whimsical and family-friendly tour of the first three films in the series, LEGO Indiana Jones didn’t stray far from the successful formula Traveller’s Tales established with its brickbusting LEGO Star Wars games, but it didn’t really have to, as evident from the dozen or so licensed LEGO games that have followed over the last decade-and-a-half. With a great sense of imagination and a huge list of playable characters, LEGO Indiana Jones was certainly the most fun way to re-experience the original films in a virtual environment since Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures for SNES back in 1994. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/lego-indy-1732684775164.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2008's LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, from Traveller's Tales.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveller’s Tales released a quickfire sequel in 2009 dubbed LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues, which included new levels for the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but slightly poorer versions of the original trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But back over at LucasArts, how were things going with its belated but bold new biomechanically-driven baby?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-our-situation-1732684924333.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Our situation has not improved."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, in early 2009 it was confirmed that LucasArts had permanently iced its Xbox 360 and PS3 Indiana Jones project, and the reportedly largely-unfinished game would never see the light of day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LucasArts allowed its third-party partners to continue working on the PS2, PSP, DS, and Wii version of the project, published in mid-2009 as Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, but the reception for an Indy adventure on such superseded hardware was understandably tepid. What did the Staff of Kings get from IGN?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/doom-five-1732685038008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Five. You know it and I know it."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released right in the heart of the motion control fad, the Staff of Kings was hamstrung by its drastic overuse of waggle. Even the Wii-exclusive co-op mode that paired Indy up with his dad was diabolically unfun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, the general consensus was that the best thing about the Staff of Kings on Wii was that it came with Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis embedded in it as a bonus. Well, that and the absolutely dead-on Sean Connery impersonation from Scottish actor Lewis MacLeod.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-staff-of-kings-1732685128872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2009's Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, for Wii.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But was this just an isolated misstep in the Indiana Jones gaming saga? One bad date before we returned to the banquet? Unfortunately, no.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones’ next appearance was Indiana Jones Adventure World, a long-defunct Zynga game that was released in 2011 and shut down in 2012. It was on Facebook, presumably wedged somewhere between all the minion memes and misinformation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-dont-look-1732685235248.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Don't look, Marion! Keep your eyes shut!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones also made an appearance in Fortnite back in 2022 as one of its hundreds and hundreds of skins, designed purely to keep Epic plush and parents poor. Indy was back in the games business after 10 long years. He just wasn’t in a fun one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, for fans of Indy’s traditional single-player adventures, Indiana Jones is finally about to return in a proper game of his own: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a first-person action adventure set between Raiders and The Last Crusade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you're not aware, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is being developed by MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein series, and frankly I can’t think of a more perfect place for the world’s most prestigious Nazi-punching professor to end up than the current home of Mr. B.J.

It could be a licensing situation and Triangle Strategy will eventually come back with a different publisher under its name.</p><p>There's also the possibility that it's getting primed for a bigger release to the PS5 and Xbox, which would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-2-is-coming-to-xbox-next-year/1100-6517893/" data-ref-id="1100-6517893">be similar to Octopath Traveler 2</a> and would fit Square Enix's recent attempts to bring its games to more platforms.</p>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an extremely demanding game that has trouble <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-pushes-ryzen-7-9800-x3d-limits/">running well</a> even on top-end hardware, but a new mod now available online introduces some optimization improvements that bring significant performance improvements at 4K and 1440p resolutions.</p>
<p>The Optimization Essentials mod developed by Hybred, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/60?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a variety of tweaks that clean up Unreal Engine's effects quality, reduce ghosting and stuttering and improve loading and boot times. While some of the presets have a big impact on visual quality, the mod introduces considerable performance improvements of up to 25% at 4K and 1440p resolution, as showcased in a new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC, </a>so it's definitely worth using for those who cannot run the game well, no matter the graphics settings used.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Optimization Mod - Up to 25% More FPS | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.8 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUZhbYvN-L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a more than worthy entry in the series, offering exactly what fans expected the game to be. While the experience is sometimes unbalanced, exploring the Zone is incredibly engaging, although its sheer size sometimes works against the experience as a whole, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Let's make one thing clear: STALKER 2 is one of the largest single player shooter games I've played, if not the largest. I reached the end after playing for 47 and a half hours, and that's after abandoning some of the sidequests. While I generally love large games, the sheer size doesn't always work in this game's favor. That's because most of the time you're scattered through the vast, completely seamless 64 square kilometers map, running on one wild goose chase after another. It gets a little repetitive after some time (prepare to visit a dozen different secret laboratories), not to mention slightly tedious for all the reasons explained in the earlier portion of the review. Moreover, while some side missions are interesting, most are fairly run-of-the-mill.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is also part of the Xbox Game Pass library on both PC and consoles.</p>

<p>On December 3, it’ll be 30 years since the original PlayStation first launched in Japan. A system that changed the course of the industry, PlayStation has been at the top of the console market for three decades now. To start the celebration, not only is Sony holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-sale-500-games-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty massive sale</a> on the PlayStation Store, but the company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released</a> a new “Thank You” video for its fans.</p>



<p>“For the past three decades, we’ve shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together,” Sony says in the video description. “Along the way, we’ve found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We’ve forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey — we couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>



<p>The two-minute video shows some of the biggest franchises in the console’s history with various messages about what PlayStation “is about”. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While December 3 marks the official 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, the console didn’t release in North America and Europe until September 1995. That means there’s still another nine months of celebration to happen, and plenty of more time for PlayStation to say “Thank You”.</p>

            <p>
Sony has released a nostalgia-fuelled video to mark PlayStation's 30th anniversary. 
</p>
<p>
It's just gone 3pm here in the UK, which means it's now past midnight on 3rd December in Japan - 30 years to the day since Sony's PS1 first launched in the country. 
</p>
<p>
Sony's video features a montage of classic games past and present that have all had a huge impact on PlayStation's legacy, beginning with Horizon: Forbidden West, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> and The Last of Us Part 2, set to a gentle remix of The Cranberries' Dreams. (Dreams itself does not feature.)

<p>
God of War, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune">Uncharted</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, Marvel's Spider-Man and many more make the cut, and like PlayStation itelf, there's plenty of third-party blockbusters here alongside games from Sony's own studios. 
</p>
<p>
"For the past three decades, we've shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together," Sony wrote alongside the video. 
</p>
<p>
"Along the way, we've found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We've forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey - we couldn't have done it without you."
</p>
<p>Last week we learned a newly-official <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-officially-surpasses-160m-sales-retaining-its-best-selling-console-crown">sales total for PS2 of 160m sales</a>. Here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-playstations-30th-anniversary-london-tube-carriage-looks">PlayStation also rolled out a special tube carriage on the London Underground</a>.</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has a special week of PlayStation-themed content lined up, beginning when 3rd December rolls around here in the UK.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/blizzard-is-removing-original-warcraft-i-and-ii-from-gog-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The classic versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II are being delisted from GOG on 13th December, at Blizzard’s request. However, anyone that buys the games before that date will continue to receive ongoing support from GOG themselves as part of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">GOG Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p>Presumably someone at Blizzard just couldn’t handle the idea that the games are available in their original form when there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/warcraft-and-warcraft-2-remastered-released-alongside-major-update-for-warcraft-3-reforged/">recently been a remaster of the games</a> – a bit like how you can’t buy a legit print of the original Star Wars films, for some reason. These remasters have brought a number of technical improvements, such as multi-unit selection in Warcraft I and right click actions across the board, as well as revised graphics that can be toggled on and off at will.</p>
<p>However, there’s something just a little bit off about the remastered graphics, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJ3ebyzORk">they forgot to accommodate for the tall pixels</a> with the original game that came from playing DOS games on old CRT screens. It means that everything in the remastered game is just a bit… wider. Also the mission briefings have motion that are completely ignored for Blizzard’s remastered versions.</p>


<p>Warcraft on GOG, however, has already had a number of preservation efforts made as it’s integrated into the DOSBox emulator for the original, and with a custom DirectX wrapper for the sequel. As some of the first inductees into the Preservation Program, GOG committed to ensuring that these games would have technical support from them to maintain compatibility with the newest versions of Windows.</p>
<p>GOG is now extending that with a pledge to maintain compatibility even if a game is delisted from their store. It’s worth remembering that games bought via GOG are DRM free, so they can always be downloaded, stored and played later.</p>

<p>As part of this announcement, they’ve cooked up a $2 USD, €2, £1.50 and 8 PLN discount using the code MAKEWARCRAFTLIVEFOREVER on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle">Warcraft I &amp; II Bundle</a>, bringing it down a smidge to £10.39.</p>
<p>The Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest with the full trilogy of Warcraft RTS games is £34.99.</p>
<p>GOG closed out the announcement by saying:</p>
<p>“We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Blizzard on these titles. While the delisting is unfortunate, we assure you that every user who already owns these games on GOG will continue to benefit from our commitment and have access to versions that remain compatible with modern systems, preserving their experience for years to come.</p>
<p>“We’re thankful to every Blizzard employee who contributed to these timeless games and for your ongoing partnership over the years. Game preservation is at the heart of what we do, and we hope to continue collaborating with Blizzard to keep these iconic titles accessible to future generations of gamers.”</p>

            <p>Netease's free to play open world gacha <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Project Mugen now has a proper name: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>. As Edwin points out in the Maw, it is very much like Spider-Man meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, with its mixture of cityslinging and unabashed anime teens with long, flowy hair and a penchant for metal accessories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Project Mugen debuted in August 2023, with devs Naked Rain releasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAPIKxrSDw">slick trailer</a> that showed its anime cast (technically not) webslinging across a lavishly presented city, as well as driving cars and cyberbikes around its neon streets. It garnered a lot of attention. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-mugens-lead-producer-reveals-the-games-and-films-inspiring-this-open-world-action-rpg">IGN</a> has an interview from later that year that goes over combat and microtransactions. Then, there's a bit of a silence.</p>
<p>Naked Rain emerged with a bit of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Project_Mugen/comments/1amcsmw/happy_spring_festival_spring_festivals_messages/">Chinese New Year art</a> in February 2024. In August, they held a recruitment event in Shanghai, where fans could talk with the devs and possibly join the team (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1gbrexs/where_is_project_mugen_a_short_overview_of_things/">here's a link to a reddit post</a> that rounds everything up nicely). Now, they've released a trailer announcing the game's name change and an overview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9py8e7ma7U">with snippets of in-game footage</a>.</p>

<p>So does it look any good? Well, the world is easy on the eye and traversing it seems fun. I'm into the way you can enter shops without any loading screens, and the sneak peaks of combat seem slick. It's still too early to say how it'll all come together, especially when this is a gacha game and will no doubt feature about a bazillion currencies and steer players towards opening their wallets to secure the bunny girls with the highest stats.</p>
<p>There's another trailer dropping on the 4th December, so hopefully that will reveal a bit more on what you'll <em>actually</em> get up to. You can pre-register for Ananta over on <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/preview/">their website</a>, although there's no release date just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Path of Exile 2 is coming for the crown of ARPG king. It’s no secret the original PoE has co-op and multiplayer, so I’m here to clear up any questions and confusions relating to Path of Exile 2’s potential co-op and multiplayer—it would be nice to have someone to clear the path with.</p>



<p>Multiplayer takes many forms in 2024: Online multiplayer shooters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, couch co-op tag teams in It Takes Two, and outrageous tests of patience such as Chained Together. I personally love single-player games as much as anyone, but you can’t beat getting together for some harmonious co-op or multiplayer action.</p>



<p>The nature of Path of Exile 2 makes it perfect for either form of gameplay. 2013’s PoE incorporated co-op multiplayer into its action, but this doesn’t mean Path of Exile 2 continues on the multiplayer co-op theme. Let’s see what the developer is cooking up.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-multiplayer-co-op">Is Path of Exile 2 Multiplayer Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Path of Exile 2 team, assemble! Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Good news! <strong>Path of Exile 2 features both online multiplayer and local couch co-op</strong> for you to enjoy the game with other people, either via wi-fi, or sitting next to someone.</p>



<p><strong>The confirmation comes from Grinding Gear Games itself</strong> via an official YouTube announcement trailer and the official FAQ.</p>



<h3 id="h-local-couch-co-op">Local Couch Co-op</h3>



<p>If you consult the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 frequently asked questions post</a>, under the query asking, “Is couch co-op available in Early Access?,” the answer says, “<strong>Yes, you can play Path of Exile 2 in couch co-op mode on a single account right from the start.</strong> The second player will be able to create a character on that account.”</p>



<p>No waiting around and no kerfuffle here—it’s immediate access to local <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-path-of-exile-2-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couch co-op</a> with a player of your choosing. Furthermore, the “Path of Exile 2 – Console Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games” trailer also confirmed couch co-op was slated for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-online-multiplayer-co-op">Online Multiplayer Co-op</h3>



<p>Hammering home the notion of online multiplayer and co-op for Path of Exile 2 is the announcement trailer I referenced above. The trailer says “<strong>Online multiplayer play requires PlayStation Plus membership</strong>.” It also mentions crossplay for Path of Exile 2 too—so you and your friends don’t need to play PoE 2 on the same format.</p>



<p>Check out the cool trailer below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gog-preservation-program-pledges-updates-for-delisted-games-as-warcraft-1-and-2-delisted.1049571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>are to be delisted from its storefront, but don't worry; the recently-announced Preservation Program has had its terms updated to account for occasions like this.</p>

<p>In a press release, GOG confirms that the two real-time strategy games will be removed from its store on December 13th, probably in light of the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>remasters that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor" rel="nofollow">leaked ahead of</a>, and were then confirmed during, the franchise's recent 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>

<p>However, in that same press release, GOG also announces a new feature for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Preservation Program</a>, an initiative that pledges to keep games updated for modern systems whether or not their developers are still supporting said games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=ggjhTDv1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=_eOnWInZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>may be getting delisted from GOG, but you're in luck if you did happen to buy it via GOG's store.</figcaption></figure><p>GOG says that from now on, if a game joins the Preservation Program, it will be supported with updates and compatibility patches "even if it gets delisted from [GOG]".</p>

<p>Thankfully, since "from now on" begins today, that new feature will cover the two original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games, so if you did happen to buy them via GOG, you don't need to worry about them suddenly losing compatibility or support.</p>

<p>In fact, if you've yet to pick up the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on GOG</a>, then you can currently do so using the discount code MakeWarcraftLiveForever, which knocks "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP, or 8 PLN off" your order.</p>

<p>It'll only work with those currencies, but as GOG points out, you can simply change your currency at the bottom of the store page if you're not currently working within one of the supported currencies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=2bzo0wgv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=S0dA5ZlS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be entitled to a discount right now if you pick up the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games on GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>That code's only available to be used once for each user, though, so once it's gone, it's gone. Bear that in mind before you pick up the bundle.</p>

<p>Given that Activision Blizzard doesn't seem to be making the same promise of eternal compatibility and support for its own remastered&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles, you may want to grab these games via GOG if you're looking for peace of mind. We'll bring you more on this, and all other things GOG, as we get it.</p>

<p>Tencent has acquired another new game studio, Chinese studio Kuro Games. </p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Youxi Putao</a> — then found by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> — , Tencent has purchased 37% of the Wuthering Waves developer’s shares. When adding it to the 24.4% it already owned, the new acquisition gives the company 51.4% of the shares, and a controlling stake in the company.</p>



<p>The purchase also makes Tencent the only external shareholder of the company.</p>



<p>According to Kuro Games’ internal memo to staff, the studio will continue to work independently. It was iterated that “operational strategy will remain unchanged”. An example used in the memo was Tencent’s ownership in Riot Games and Supercell.</p>



<p>“Based on our past collaborative experiences with Tencent, we firmly believe that this external shareholder change will provide Kuro with a more stable external environment, further benefiting our future independent operational strategies and long-term development,” the internal memo reads via machine translation.</p>



<p>“Over the past decade, our original intention of creating games has never changed, and it will remain unchanged in the next decade. We will continue to love our players, our games, and our team.”</p>



<p>Kuro Games is set to release Version 2.0 of Wuthering Waves on January 2.</p>



<p>What do you think of Tencent buying another game studio? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, a free-to-play game launched in 2017 for mobile devices, is now available in a "Complete" edition for $10. This new version of the game does away with Pocket Camp's microtransactions in exchange for a set price point, at least to begin with. After January 30, 2025, the price will double.</p><p>The game has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-announced-arriving-in-december/1100-6527417/" data-ref-id="1100-6527417">same features as the previous edition</a>, as well as some new ones. For example, players can import their own custom designs from Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch. Players can assign the custom designs to clothing, and items like umbrellas, walkways, and flooring, among other things.</p><ul><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Download at iTunes</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa&amp;pli=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download at Google Play</a></li></ul><p>Anyone who already played Pocket Camp when it was free can continue their journey. Players can link their Pocket Camp app to their Nintendo Account to transfer save data to the Complete edition to do this, but they must do so by June 1, 2025.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="364818667"

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/workers-resources-soviet-republic">Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</a>, the Warsaw Pact-era city-building sim from 3DIVISION and Hooded Horse, is getting eight new maps scattered across the globe. These include a map set in the Eastern United States, from approximately New York State down to North Carolina, and another one set in Rock Paper Shotgun's very own United Kingdom, where Karl Marx wrote most of his best stuff.</p>
<p>"Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades," explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords. It's high time we sceptre-kissing Brits learned the importance of a properly joined-up sewage system. Looking at you, Thames Water. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Aside from the USA and the British Isles, the DLC includes maps based on Austria, the Czech Republic, East Germany, France, Estonia and North Korea. "Every map will differ in terms of overall size and the challenges the local topography brings, and they will also come with pre-generated towns, cities, and infrastructure," the announcement release explains. "This will require players to mold and shape their nations over time in order to create a new wave of top-notch Soviet Republics."</p><p>I still haven't played Workers &amp; Resources, but I've greatly enjoyed reading Sin's articles about it. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-review">her review of the 1.0 version</a> from June 2024, she paints a simultaneously appealing and terrifying picture of a game where setting up a recycling service or demolishing a mine requires you to implement a whole infrastructure of specialised workers, vehicles and buildings (there are also plenty of options to simplify the simulation, if desired).</p>
<p>"I could recite a litany of frustrations and wishes, but it would be dwarfed by the novella about how absorbing and fascinating Workers &amp; Resources is," Sin wrote. "I love its conceptual commitment to a planned economy that its genremates observe de facto but don't examine. Its complex models and processes built for the joy and satisfaction of watching them come together. Its foundations in Slovak history and experience, and its refusal to be like anything else."</p>
<p>Sin also has a piece from a couple years back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-ostriv-workers-resources-and-where-town-builders-ought-to-go-next">exploring how Workers &amp; Resources deviates from the liberal American idea of town-building epitomised by SimCity</a>. I imagine she'd be keen to see how the game stacks up when you actually transport it to North America, though I suspect there are mods that do this already. Sort of feels like the logical endgame here is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM">go to space</a>. There are probably mods for that too.

</p><p>The Worlds Map DLC is out on 13th December via Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store, and will be localised into the same languages as the base game.</p>
