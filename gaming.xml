            <p>
Atari has purchased the Intellivision brand, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest running console war in history".
</p>
<p>
Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.

</p>
<p>
Now Atari owns the rights to over 200 games from the Intellivision portfolio and its trademarks. However, Intellivision Entertainment will continue developing and distributing the <a href="https://intellivision.com/">Amico console</a> under a new brand and with a licence from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on that console.

<p>
"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision and the golden age of gaming," said Atari chairman and CEO Wade Rosen.
</p>
<p>
"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellivision brand," said Phil Adam, CEO of Intellivision Entertainment. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and the prospect of bringing a broad array of new titles to the Amico family gaming platform."
</p>
<p>
Atari will now expand the digital and physical distribution of Intellivision games, explore brand and licensing opportunities, and potentially create new games.
</p>
<p>
So, perhaps a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/atari-2600-10306">Lego Intellivision to match the Atari</a>? Until then, there's a new t-shirt.

Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-bought-rollercoaster-tycoon-3-for-7m">Atari bought the rights to Rollercoaster Tycoon 3</a> from developer Frontier, meaning it's now the sole publisher of all games in the theme park sim series.

</p>
<p>
Before that, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-acquired-the-rights-to-a-load-of-old-retro-ip-including-busby-and-hardball">Atari bought the rights to over 100 retro games</a> from the 80s and 90s, including Bubsy, Demolition Racer, and more.

According to the announcement, Atari will take over the Intellivision brand and over 200 games from its library.</p><p>“Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore brand and licensing opportunities,” Atari wrote in the press release.</p><p>Interestingly, though, this deal doesn’t include the <a href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271">Intellivision Amico</a>. Atari stated that Intellivision would rebrand itself and continue to work on developing the console project that was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/18008970/intellivision-amico-console-announcement-release-date-price">originally scheduled to launch in 2020</a> and was once headed up by “prolific” video game composer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24074902/tommy-tallarico-oof-hbomberguy-mtv-cribs-house-listing">Tommy Tallarico</a>. Atari said that the company formerly known as Intellivision would rebrand itself and that it would grant licensing rights to the new company permitting it to feature Intellivision games on the console.</p><p>“We look forward to our expanded collaboration and the prospect of bringing a broad array of new titles to the Amico family gaming platform,” said Intellivision CEO Phil Adam in the press release.</p><p>Atari and Intellivision competed against each other with their dueling Atari 2600 and Intellivision home consoles. Developed by Mattel Electronics and introduced in 1979, the Intellivision sold roughly 5 million units by 1990. Atari has established itself as a retro gaming-focused company, relaunching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113699/atari-400-mini-hands-on">mini</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">versions</a> of its consoles, supporting the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam">rerelease of its games on modern consoles</a>, acquiring retro gaming developers like Digital Eclipse, and now buying its retro gaming peer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="zDFE9y">If imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery, Alex Roberts’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/23632869/dnd-dungeons-dragons-alternatives-role-play-storytelling"><em>For the Queen</em></a> might be the most lavishly complimented game in indie role-playing game history. First published in 2019 by <a href="https://evilhat.com/roleplaying-games">Evil Hat Productions</a>, the company behind <em>Fate</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22446171/blades-in-the-dark-rpg-review-evil-hat"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23342844/queer-tabletop-games-thirsty-sword-lesbians"><em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em></a>, <em>Monster of the Week</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23759900/apocalypse-keys-rpg-preview-impressions-release-date-price"><em>Apocalypse Keys</em></a>, among many other games, <em>For the Queen </em>was an immediate sensation among indie tabletop fans. It’s a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23997106/best-rpgs-zero-no-prep-dnd-alternative-indie-tabletop">no-prep, no-GM storytelling game</a> that’s designed to build high drama and deep emotion quickly: Players create their characters through play by drawing from a deck of narrative prompt cards that let them build a fraught, conflicted relationship with the enigmatic queen they love and serve. The best proof that Roberts’ design is appealing and inviting? It’s inspired a <a href="https://itch.io/c/534770/descended-from-the-queen">huge wave</a> of <a href="https://www.forthedrama.com/listejeux">independent, self-published</a> <a href="https://itch.io/c/1481461/descended-from-the-queen">copycat games</a>. </p>
<p id="hlMftl">Roberts, also the creator of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/7/17328112/star-crossed-shipper-tabletop-game-kickstarter"><em>Star Crossed</em></a> and <a href="https://helloalexroberts.itch.io/">many other indie RPGs</a>, published <em>For the Queen</em> under a Creative Commons license, giving other creators the right to make their own structurally similar RPGs under the label <a href="https://forthequeengame.com/">Descended From the Queen</a>. Those games vary immensely in tone, content, and intent, but they all credit Roberts’ work as their inspiration, which has just bolstered <em>For the Queen</em>’s reputation further.</p>
<p id="f2mZaf"><em>For the Queen</em> now has an <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/announcing-for-the-queen/">expanded, updated second edition</a> that was released by Critical Role’s publishing house, Darrington Press. Polygon caught up with Roberts via Zoom to talk about what the new edition of <em>For the Queen</em> adds and changes, why she wants to do an explicit adults-only version of the game, how she feels about the dozens of RPGs she’s inspired (and which ones she recommends), and why the highlight of her career was designing a LARP about kinky balloon fetishists.</p>

<p id="TA7cLO"><strong>Polygon: Why did you move </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> from Evil Hat to Darrington Press?</strong></p>
<p id="LeGqkw"><strong>Alex Roberts:</strong> <em>For the Queen</em> was the last boxed game Evil Hat put out. Since then, they have been doing exclusively books. When they made that change, <em>For the Queen</em> was 80% done, so they finished it, which was nice — but it was almost on the chopping block, actually. Some people within the company advocated for it, so I was very happy that they put it out at all. It has been a little indie success, or critical success, or something, so that’s been really nice, but obviously, over the years — I think they were not displeased when I was like, “I’ve been chatting with other publishers about the possibility of someone else putting it out.”</p>
<p id="yV6gjA">There was a lot of love for the game internally, but — I don’t want to say they didn’t know what to do with it, but it was just not really in-line with where they put their efforts. You could get it in specialty game shops, but you couldn’t get it more broadly. And it’s kind of a role-playing game, but it’s also kind of not. So it was in a weird section of their website. Basically, I had been wanting to do a second edition or an expansion, and I kind of thought Evil Hat wasn’t going to be down for that.</p>
<p id="xG27yi">A friend of mine at Darrington said “Hey, we’re looking to publish more games, do you maybe want to do something with us?” In the summer of 2022, they had tagged me into work on <a href="https://shop.critrole.com/products/till-the-last-gasp"><em>Till the Last Gasp</em></a>, a two-player game I did some design work on. So I’d had a good experience working with them. When Darcy Ross, their marketing manager, reached out to me and said “You want to do something else? Maybe we could publish an Alex Roberts game?” I was like, “I’ve actually been looking for maybe a new publisher for a second edition of <em>For the Queen</em>.” And [Darrington head] Ivan Van Norman emails me right away. Basically, the response was, “Yes. We are huge fans.” I know a couple of the Critical Role folks are big fans of <em>For the Queen</em>, and they jumped on it. There was just so much enthusiasm for the game on their side that it was very easy to be like, “Okay, great, let’s go!”</p>

<p id="fFrc6d"><strong>What did you want to address with a second edition? What needed changing or expanding?</strong></p>
<p id="PEUoWG">For the most part, it was about expanding. I wanted to write more cards. I wanted to write new prompts. People tell me the game has a lot of replayability — there’s enough randomization and enough ambiguity in the questions that nobody ever answers a question the same way twice. But I have been playing that game a lot since it was a pile of notecards in a little purse. I would write new cards and take some out — I played it so much in playtesting and promoting it, playing it with different people. I knew I wanted new things in it. My personal copy had new, handwritten cards in it. So I mostly wanted to add to it.</p>
<p id="f05a8t">But there were also certain things in the rules — the way the “pass” mechanic is phrased always seems to cause stumbles, often enough that I don’t like it. There were one or two cards — they’re supposed to be ambiguous and interpretive, but one or two sometimes made players scratch their heads, or stop play for a second. And I know it’s perfectly normal for people playing a board game to be reading through the rules and have to stop and go, “Wait, what does that mean?” and maybe Google it or something. I know that’s totally fine. But I hate it! Not in my game. I wanted it to be smooth as silk; I just want it to flow.</p>
<p id="fscfzg">So there were a few little things I wanted to change, and there was so much to add. And then on top of that, Darrington was like, “We want twice as many queen illustrations in the second edition.”<em> </em>There are like 25 queens in the new edition. The first one, I think, had 12 or 15. And that’s so exciting to me, especially because everyone who has the first edition will still have all of their original queens that they love, and they get to add more.</p>

<p id="hxIE24"><strong>Does the new edition have more prompt cards, or just tweaked, different prompts?</strong></p>
<p id="kGJ0lU">More. I think there were only two questions I took out, and then there are 10 new ones that I added. And some of them have been rephrased. </p>
<p id="u4ljPC"><strong>You’ve mentioned wanting to do expansions of the game as well. What did you have in mind?</strong></p>
<p id="h6Rx0X">That’s definitely something I still want to do. <em>For the Queen</em> fans should buy this game a lot, so that there’s every economic reason to let me simply write prompt cards for the rest of my life. There are a couple of expansions I would really like to do. In my mind, I just want to do more prompts, but if I really thought about it, I’m sure I could also introduce new mechanics to the game. Theoretically, you could make a different setup — imagine the same questions about the queen, but instead of being on a journey to a distant power to broker an alliance in a time of peril, you’d be doing something else. </p>
<p id="aeN3gD">I’d love to do an adults-only expansion that really emphasizes your more intimate relationship with the queen, where cards could be quite explicit. Obviously, there’s always an intense power dynamic between player characters and the queen, and people, for lack of a better term, get horny about that! So people bring that to the game. But I also know people play with their kids. Kids understand profound power dynamics in a different way — they understand it, and they can play with it, let me tell you — but I would love to be able to write cards that are not for kids. [<em>Laughs</em>] And that explore that more explicitly.</p>
<p id="aur1Fz">I also think it would be interesting to write questions that were specifically about rebellion — say, that assume some of you are planning to betray the queen, and maybe you can have ambiguous feelings about that. Or ones specifically suited to a particular setting — like ones that assume you’re in space, and she’s a spaceship queen.</p>
<p id="Tkfp4V">I would love to make more Descended from the Queen games, and do sequels to <em>For the Queen</em>. I already have some sequels in progress. But part of me just wants to release booster packs, like Pokémon cards. </p>

<p id="FEHofg"><strong>Both editions of </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> are so built around aesthetics, particularly the sleek custom game boxes. If you started releasing booster packs, wouldn’t you have to rethink how the game is boxed and packaged?</strong></p>
<p id="zSbeJa">In the alternate universe where <em>For the Queen</em> is as popular as <em>Magic: the Gathering</em> or something, [I imagine] people are deck-building, and they have their custom decks, and their own boxes for them. Whenever I’m working on a prompt-based game, I like to put [the working copy] in a cute little purse or makeup bag. So everyone could have their own little pet deck. But that’s really pie-in-the-sky thinking. I would just love to be able to write more for this game, and give people the option to expand on the experience and take it in new directions.</p>
<p id="DE7B0b"><strong>The Descended from the Queen phenomenon is such a unique aspect of this game, with so many other people using this engine to create their own games. What was the original conversation like in terms of putting the game out under a Creative Commons license?</strong></p>
<p id="YlbBem">To me, there was no reason to not do it, or not support it. The thing is, nobody needs my permission to make a game that is functionally Descended from the Queen. It’s just a bunch of cards. And it’s not like <em>For the Queen</em> is the first game to use that format. For a lot of people, it’s the first one they’ve encountered. But there’s quite a tradition to have a game in a deck of cards. There’s <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/144510/183-Days" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a game called <em>183 Days</em></a>; my gosh, it’s a fantastic game. It’s beautiful. It’s a little more complex than <em>For the Queen</em>, because eventually, the deck gets split into two, and it’s all very procedural.</p>
<p id="SGrVF4">And one of my favorite live-action role-playing games of all time, the one I recommend to first-time LARPers, is <a href="https://bullypulpitgames.com/products/juggernaut">Jason Morningstar’s <em>Juggernaut</em></a>. You just pull the first card and it tells you what to do, but then some of those cards end up belonging to a machine that tells the future. It’s a great piece of tech.</p>
<p id="WA02bd">The most obvious antecedent of <em>For the Queen</em> is <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/169890/The-Beast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aleksandra Sontowska’s <em>The Beast</em></a>, a one-player RPG where basically, you find a monster and bring it home, and slowly, over the course of the game, you develop a sexual relationship with it. It’s very different content than <em>For the Queen</em>, and it’s about journal prompts rather than questions and follow-up questions and <em>For the Queen</em>’s group dynamic. But I played it and loved it, and it was a big influence on me. </p>
<p id="wn19bM">So encouraging people to make games inspired by <em>For the Queen</em> — people are gonna do it. I love that they do it. Why not support it? If there’s some kind of commercial or business aspect to that decision, I’m sure it exists. I just know I’m stoked when people approach me and say, “I made a game because of your game<em>.</em>” So I really just genuinely want to encourage that.</p>

<p id="tevt0P"><strong>I’ve seen authors similarly say they love fanfic inspired by their work — but they also often say they can’t read it, whether for legal reasons, or because they can’t have someone else’s version of their characters taking up space in their heads. Have you played many Descended from the Queen games?</strong></p>
<p id="7bvuBG">I embrace it in theory. The first Descended from the Queen game — which was a bit like <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts"><em>Monsterhearts</em></a> was to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22787981/powered-by-the-apocalypse-tabletop-rpg-explainer"><em>Apocalypse World</em></a> — I think that started before <em>For the Queen</em> was even out. It’s called <a href="https://jennmartin.itch.io/reunion%20is%20it%20called%20reunion?"><em>Reunion</em>, by Jenn Martin, Andy Munich, and Yoshi Creelman</a>. All three of them are <em>For the Queen</em> fans, and I think <em>Reunion</em> was originally conceived as “the retinue of <em>For the Queen </em>is coming back, years later.” The prompts are all in the sense of “Do you remember that time? Remember how this used to happen?” I’ve gotten to play that, and I really love it. Partially because it innovates on the format in interesting ways —  you actually pull questions and ask them of someone else, rather than answering them yourself. It has a very distinct relationship with time, where <em>For the Queen</em> has an ambiguous relationship with time. So that one’s great.</p>
<p id="8xvN5I">So is <a href="https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/keepers-of-the-cards"><em>Keepers of the Cards</em></a>. That one’s kind of a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2Fseries%2FGRNQP873R%2Fcardcaptor-sakura&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Ftabletop-games%2F24161224%2Ffor-the-queen-second-edition-changes-darrington-press-descended-games" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23925265__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRNQP873R/cardcaptor-sakura\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24161224/for-the-queen-second-edition-changes-darrington-press-descended-games&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925265__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRNQP873R/cardcaptor-sakura&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24161224/for-the-queen-second-edition-changes-darrington-press-descended-games&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em></a> fan game, which makes sense, [given the importance of] <a href="https://ccsakura.fandom.com/wiki/Clow_Cards">the clow cards</a>, right? And there’s one called <a href="https://nycavri.itch.io/descending-the-stairs"><em>Descending the Stairs</em></a> about a venue that’s closing, and you’re there on its last night, so you’re having this very specific relationship with time. So in theory, I’m all about it. In practice… I have a once-a-month RPG meetup, and when I’m there, I want to play something very new. I play a little bit outside of that. Someday I’ll go to a gaming convention again. So I’d love to play more Descended from the Queen games, but my priority is to play something that feels really new to me. All of us have our white-whale games. Someday I’d love to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Roleplaying_Game">West End’s Star Wars game</a>, just once. </p>
<p id="MWMZ2J"><strong>What’s the status of your spinoff game </strong><em><strong>For the Cube</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="0Sb2xt">[<em>Laughs</em>] <em>For the Cube</em> is a game that 75% of the time, works like magic and people love it, and then the rest of the time, it doesn’t quite hit right. So it’s still in playtesting. Again, if <em>For the Queen</em> does really, really well, maybe Darrington will put it out there and kick me to finish it. But it is in progress. It is happening. I would not be surprised if it exists as a viable product in the next year or two. It’s coming down the pipe, but it’s taking its time.</p>

<p id="XxsEvQ"><strong>You’re known most for </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Star Crossed</strong></em><strong>, but you have so many smaller games out there, many of them independently published. What are you proudest of? Or what would you point a </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> fan to if they want something very different that still has your sensibility?</strong></p>
<p id="zJeWu5">Okay, so I have two answers. The game people probably want to play is <a href="https://helloalexroberts.itch.io/our-time-on-earth"><em>Our Time on Earth</em></a>, a two-player game that you play asynchronously, in six days or six weeks or six months. You message each other, or write letters, whatever, that kind of epistolary format. And you pretend that the two of you are aliens visiting Earth for a limited time, for six days or six weeks or six months. And you send each other messages about what you’re experiencing in the world.</p>
<p id="13iOR6">It’s a very sweet game that takes place in these very small moments. If you want to hear an actual play, I was on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4SHXpDJXucWVdWdpRqYp4n"><em>Party of One</em> with Jeff Stormer</a>, and we played it over audio messages to each other. It’s very soft. It’s an understated game, and it takes place in these tiny little experiences with one person. It’s very easy to play, because all you need is a friend who lives far away, and I think we all have a friend who lives far away, who we don’t see as often as we would like. </p>

<p id="oVLjBF">So that’s my palatable answer that is probably accurate to what people want. But here’s the thing: The best game I’ve ever made is <em>Pop!</em> It’s a live-action game about a community of balloon fetishists. It’s in the <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/product/honey-hot-wax/"><em>Honey and Hot Wax</em> anthology</a> of live-action games, although I don’t think this game is erotic. I think it’s just about sex, kind of. It came out in March 2020, when <em>nobody</em> was playing games that involved intimate contact.</p>
<p id="3XBELn"><em>Pop!</em> is the best game I’ve ever made. I’m so proud of it. Everyone who’s played it has had a beautiful experience. It’s played in person — you put up a bunch of paper on the walls and you write on it with markers, because you’re playing an online community. So you’re in the room with other people, but you’re not actually interacting face-to-face with them until the last act of the game, which is a little half-hour in-person meetup, where you meet all your friends and enemies from online in person. And people always act differently online than they do in person, and that carries over to role-play as well. </p>
<p id="LtPAqq">Some people love to pop balloons, and that’s fun and hot. Some people have a phobic response to popping. And all those people are trying to get along in a community together. I thought about that game for years. I never thought I would actually make it, because I thought <em>Nobody wants to play my game about balloon kinksters</em>. But I went to an artist residency in Corvallis, Oregon, and I was like, <em>Okay, this is my one chance</em>, so we did it and ran it, and it was so fun and so great. I wish more people would play it. </p>
<p id="WAaCG9">If you can get 10 to 12 people into a room with a lot of paper and pens, and everyone’s willing to play about the things we didn’t think we would ever have in common with other people — it’s a game about desire and finding belonging, and then having that belonging challenged, and how we get along with people. How our insecurities and peculiarities can get in the way of that. And feeling like a freak, and then feeling like a member of a group. That’s my real answer. I wish everyone would play <em>Pop!</em></p>

<p id="IeJUGt"><strong>Looping back to </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> — it’s such a flexible game. I’ve seen it played almost comedically, or for high drama. It can be a game about loyalty, or longing, or about vengeance against someone who dares to make you feel desire you can’t act on. Do you have a favorite playthrough experience?</strong></p>
<p id="2N6Q26">I’ve had a few. I played it with a friend of mine on a road trip. They were driving, and I was in the passenger seat. Something about that format gave us so much opportunity to answer questions, and then really sit and reflect on them, and stare out the window and talk about relationships.</p>
<p id="qaBZML">But honestly, something that is really memorable, that really stays with me, was playtesting the game with my dad and sister. My dad had never played a role-playing game before. In that game — I won’t go into too much detail, but I learned a lot about how my father feels about his military service. For whatever reason, there was a way to learn that through this game, and through his fictional character, who was a soldier in service of the queen. For whatever reason, I hadn’t learned about that before, and I don’t know if there would have been another way to understand that side of him. So that one definitely sticks out for me.  </p>

Disappointingly enough, Druckmann spends chunks of the interview hyping up AI technology as a cost-cutting measure. As a person who is a fan of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ writing when it’s written by people like <em>Part II</em>’s narrative lead Halley Gross, it’s a huge fucking bummer to see him even entertaining that AI could be used to write dialogue, even as he passively mentions “ethical issues” with zero follow up. He says that as long as one can “precisely direct” AI tools, they could be used to create “nuanced dialogues and characters.” Were the beloved ones you and your team created with their hearts, minds, and skills not enough?</p><p>“AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address,” Druckmann said. “With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we’re reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games. This evolution is truly empowering creators to bring their visions to life without the traditional obstacles.”</p><p>Whatever your feelings on <em>The Last of Us</em>, the series has been considered one of the most important narrative franchises in AAA video games of the past decade (and if you forget, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030">someone working on the franchise will remind you</a></span>, don’t worry).

<p>After information about Valve’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/">in-development hero shooter</a> Deadlock began to appear online, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s roster of characters</a>, more looks at the game are starting to pop up. The latest involves a number of gameplay clips <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-gameplay-leak-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing off how the game works</a>.</p>



<p>Searching anywhere on Reddit at the moment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cyqtcr/neon_prime_gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will bring up plenty</a> of Deadlock gameplay videos to watch. The videos range from short clips to full walkthroughs on how the game’s mechanics work at this stage. Someone even shared <a href="https://imgur.com/CSpjEtG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the lore for each of the characters</a> in the game.</p>



<p>You can check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cyvkh0/new_deadlock_gameplay_videos_has_just_been_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some of the gameplay videos</a> below. Another can be <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/bu2i3v.webm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. </p>



<p>Currently, Deadlock is in an alpha state and has yet to be officially revealed by Valve. The game is a 6v6 hero shooter with gameplay elements similar to traditional MOBAs like Valve’s DOTA 2. Each hero, which you can upgrade with new items throughout a match, has various abilities as well as an ultimate ability.</p>

A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419240/Sushi_Ben/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamVR</a> release is also planned.</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p>Fancy a cozy adventure in a stunning locale? Inspired by real-life experiences, Sushi Ben drops you into an idyllic seaside town rich with addictive mini-games and curious characters across an anime-inspired slice-of-life sim.</p><p>I’m excited for the chance to give players insight into what to expect in Sushi Ben and announce that the game launches May 28 for PlayStation VR2. I’ll also include some additional insights on the creation of this game from Big Brane co-founder Kane Tyler, who first conceived the idea of <em>Sushi Ben</em> as part of his college thesis.</p><p><strong>Mini Slices of Life</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Sushi Ben</em>, players are tasked with saving a sushi bar from going out of business as a group of land developers try to buy up all the property in town. You will assist the townsfolk with various activities and tasks to cultivate business.</p><p>As one would expect, <em>Sushi Ben</em> has a wonderful fishing game at its core. As you develop relationships with the locals and complete quests, you’ll fish for the particular type each customer wants so that you can bring their business into the restaurant. That’s only the tip of the iceberg, though.</p><p>The townsfolk have unique motivations and desires and, thus, have a wide range of mini-games for players to engage with. There’s table tennis, stone carving, bug catching, dog walking, archery, and more. Each one takes advantage of the dynamic movements that make virtual reality gaming immersive and exciting, challenging players to get moving and use their hand-eye coordination in fun ways.</p><p><strong>Storytelling in <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [139 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a></strong></p><p>We at Big Brane hope players are captivated by how the story is told. The freedom of VR, where players have a perpetually unlocked ability to look anywhere at any time, creates some challenges when directing focus. To attract the player’s eye, you must make things stand out, and that’s where our dynamic manga panels come into play.</p><p>The thesis specifically focused on filmmaking techniques in virtual reality, which is a significant challenge given that the player is the camera. It’s our job then to provide visual clues and guidance, and Kane, while watching JoJo’s Bizarre <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,475 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>, was suddenly inspired by the idea of manga panels. Using manga panels as a dynamic focal point for VR users became the driving force behind the thesis. </p><p><strong>The Pursuit of Authenticity</strong></p><p><em>Sushi Ben</em>‘s seaside village is inspired by thousands of hours of research and by Kane’s time working at a sushi bar with a Chef named Takayuki “Ben” Okuda. When the pandemic prevented many from traveling globally, Kane invested tons and tons of hours into using Google Maps to explore the world and find particular elements that could feed into this authentic representation of a seaside town in Japan, but inspired by the home-town feel of Kane’s neighborhood in Savannah, Georgia. </p><p><em>Sushi Ben</em> is written by Hato Moa, writer of the indie hit Hatoful Boyfriend. Kane dreamed of bringing in voice actors he was a fan of from different anime. Still, he put control of this effort in Hato Moa’s hands because she was in Japan and had the experience and familiarity to get the right people for the gig. It just so happened that Moa shared the same goals, agreeing to their ideal cast in unison. The game’s script blew away the voice actors. Moa, Kane, and the crew ran with their enthusiasm. </p><p><strong>Features and Accessibility</strong></p><p>From the start, the game was designed to be approachable for any VR player – new or experienced. In addition to featuring a gameplay experience with a serene and interesting setting and cozy mini-games, <em>Sushi Ben</em> also has features for VR players that address player comfort and ability. There are options for sitting and standing players, and for those who choose to sit or are differently abled, there’s a height adjustment that allows you to remain seated but have the perspective come from a taller point of view.</p><p>For those desiring different degrees of comfort with VR, there are various settings like full locomotion and teleportation options for movement and snap turning or smooth rotations. In addition, dialogue can be set to autoplay, or players can enjoy the Story Mode, which skips the game portions entirely, allowing them to focus on the narrative. This and many other settings can be changed anytime to accommodate every player’s desired experience.  </p><p><em>Sushi Ben</em> takes advantage of a few features as it comes over to PS VR2, enhancing the visual quality, and giving players a more immersive experience with detailed haptics.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The PS5 library has grown considerably over the past few years, and if you've been gaming since 2020, there's a good chance you're running out of storage space. It's not uncommon to see titles take up 100GB or more--meaning your drive can fill up from just a handful of games. If you're juggling games on and off your PS5, consider picking up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 980 Pro SSD with Heatsink (2TB)</a>, as it's on sale for just $140 (down from $230) until tonight at 10 PM PT / 1 AM ET (May 23).</p><p>This is one of Best Buy's deals of the day, and Amazon is matching the price. Amazon's deal will likely disappear not long after Best Buy's offer expires.</p><div title="6523669 - Samsung SSD Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2399" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523669 - Samsung SSD Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Samsung 980 Pro SSD with Heatsink (2TB)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$140 (was $230)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The SSD has been priced around $180 throughout most of the year--deals such as this one have become increasingly uncommon in 2024. That makes this current offer of $140 for 2TB mighty enticing. This model includes a built-in heatsink, so getting it installed in your PS5 requires little more than popping off the faceplate and undoing a few screws. The Samsung 980 Pro has been one of the most popular storage expansion solutions for years. We tested the 980 Pro, and it's still working perfectly years later. It' virtually indistinguishable from the PS5's internal SSD. </p>                      </div><p>Of course, you can also use this with your PC. This high-end NVMe SSD boasts read speeds up to 7,000MB/s and write speeds up to 5,100MB/s. If you do use it on PC, you can check out the Samsung Magician software to get updates on the drive's health, overall performance, and check for firmware updates.</p><p>While the sale isn't as generous, you'll find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHL33X7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 980 Pro SSD with Heatsink (1TB)</a> on sale for $120 (down from $165). </p><p>Keep in mind that Best Buy is offering this sale as its Deal of the Day, and Amazon is simply price matching. That means there's a strong possibility the SSD will jump in price tomorrow. So if you're interested in the deal, it's best to check it out soon.</p><p>To help you through the installation process, be sure to check out our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-install-ssd-in-ps5/1100-6496986/" data-ref-id="1100-6496986">how to install an M.2 SSD in PS5</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony has shared a video that shows the results of a prototyping exercise in which its teams imagined what future products from the company might look like, including PlayStation.</p>
<p>In the video below, you'll see a mix of transparent smartphones, augmented reality headsets, and a games controller with a ring light in the middle.</p>
<p>The footage was first shown at Sony's annual corporate strategy meeting, where it shared its 'Creative Entertainment Vision' for where it aims to be in ten years.</p>
<p>There are also appearances from Aloy, the protagonist from Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, as well as Sony positioning Horizon as a key IP along Ghostbusters and others.</p>
<p>The video description emphasizes that anything shown "is not directy related to any existing Sony products of services."</p>

Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, "I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p>

<p>The interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, "AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games."</p>

<p>He also briefly touches on the future of <em>The Last of Us</em> TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.</p>

<p data-characters="300" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Most live service games end up going through a rough period of development every so often.

Thankfully, things are slowly settling down now that the former CEO, Johan Pilestedt, is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-steps-down-so-he-can-focus-more-on-actually-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in action</a>.</p> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">More specifically, after <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-design-may-be-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the review bombing of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a> and the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-ceo-admits-helldivers-2s-balancing-isnt-what-it-should-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questionable balancing updates</a>, the former CEO decided it was time for him to give up the business side of things and refocus on the game itself. Thus, Pilestedt stepped down from his position of CEO to step into the shoes of <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s chief creative officer and chairman. Unsurprisingly, Pilestedt already has some promising ideas on where to take <em>Helldivers 2</em> next, and many of them stem from the game’s time-to-kill or TTK.</p>

He also wants to take the players’ own sentiments into account while handling balancing questions in order to create a “holistic view of WHY feedback is given.” Hard to complain about that! The TTK bit is particularly interesting, however, as Pilestedt feels that many of the players’ issues with <em>Helldivers 2</em> stem from the fact that the game’s time-to-kill is simply too high.</p>
 <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="171" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, this doesn’t appear to mean that Arrowhead will simply carve a chunk out of each enemy’s health and call it. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weapon balancing</a>, too, is on the menu.</p>  <figure data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Overall, then, this could be the big turning point that the community has been waiting for. If Pilestedt can rally Arrowhead and begin enacting positive, meaningful changes to <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s current sandbox, the game might yet correct its course and reinvigorate the players to jump back into the thick of it.</p> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is in any real trouble, of course, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b9k51r/rant_and_vent_megathread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s biggest subreddit has grown increasingly negative </a>as time goes on, with most players eagerly anticipating Arrowhead’s next move. As one would expect, some players have already been hard at work deconstructing Pilestedt’s tweets with hard statistics to back their arguments with:<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">And, really, Arrowhead would do well to take into account this particularly passionate section of the community. So far, it seems that this is <em>precisely</em> what’s going on behind the scenes, but we won’t know what’s really up with the game’s sandbox until a few more balancing updates drop in.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">For one, I’m thrilled with the fact that Arrowhead Games is <em>at least</em> reverting the massively bolstered enemy patrol spawns sometime down the line. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Playing <em>Helldivers 2</em> solo</a> has never been quite as problematic as it’s been as of late, but with a balance patch or two and some engaging new content, a solution is already on the horizon. Let’s see how it pans out!</p>

            <p>The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 creative director Neil Druckmann has said Naughty Dog's next game could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">interview</a> shared today to coincide with Sony's corporate strategy meeting, the studio head was asked about what dream project he would like to see realised. In response, Druckmann said he has been "lucky to work on several dream projects" already, before adding he is "currently excited about a new one".</p>
<p>This undisclosed project, Druckmann said, could be Naughty Dog's "most thrilling yet".</p>

</figure>
<p>"There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up," he elaborated. "This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers.</p>
<p>"This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p>
<p>While Druckmann's words are vague, it does not seem likely this upcoming project is The Last of Us Part 3. "You have to take risks to find new ideas that connect with audiences, and even though Uncharted was a chart-topping success, it was important for our studio to innovate again with a new franchise like The Last of Us," Druckmann said during the interview. "Many companies would insist on sticking to profitable franchises, but [Sony's] culture and philosophy empower us to pursue new ideas.</p>
<p>"Art requires risk; You can't engineer perfectly and predict how successful it will be. I'm incredibly thankful that [Sony] trusts us to leverage our past successes to explore brand new creative avenues."</p>
<p>There have long been rumours that a third instalment in The Last of Us series will come one day, and Druckmann previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">studio had a story outline for Part 3 penned</a> which he hoped "one day can see the light of day". However, nothing has been confirmed to be in development.</p>
<p>Last year Druckmann additionally stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">Naughty Dog is open to developing Part 3</a>, but only if "[the team] can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love", as it did with Parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p>"With The Last of Us, it's up to us whether we want to continue it or not... If we can't come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end," Druckmann said at the time.</p>
<p>As for what Naughty Dog could be working on next, previously, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-naughty-dog-left-a-clue-about-its-next-project-in-the-last-of-us-part-1">speculation the studio had its eyes on a fantasy-themed release</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere during today's conference, head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/3.html">Asad Qizilbash</a> stated he believes games will shift their focus towards more immersive narratives and personalised player experiences in the next decade.</p>
<p>"Technological advancements will enhance emotional depth in games by allowing characters to be much more emotive and expressive, fostering more evocative storytelling," the PlayStation exec said. "That's going to help a whole generation of creators be able to just create so much more emotion in the stories. The focus is going to shift from graphics or visuals to immersive narratives that resonate long after the controller is set down.</p>
<p>"Regarding PlayStation's role in this evolution, I see it as a destination defined by community and a commitment to quality, unexpected and memorable experiences."</p>
<p>When asked what significant advancements he anticipates will have an impact on storytelling across the different forms of media over the coming decade, Qizilbash stated technology will "democratise" it and make it more accessible for creators as a result.</p>
<p>"With the level of fidelity in video games now, there's an opportunity to repurpose assets from games for animation and live-action films, leveraging Sony's volumetric and virtual production capabilities," he said. "Gaming engines like Unreal are expanding beyond games and being used for virtual production, enabling creators to focus on storytelling rather than logistical constraints. This freedom fosters creativity and allows creators to focus on delivering compelling stories.</p>
<p>"Advancements in AI will create more personalised experiences and meaningful stories for consumers. For instance, NPCs (Non Player Characters) in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal."</p>
<p>This is something Qizilbash believes is important for younger audiences who "are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalisation across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning".</p>

<p>For more, earlier today Sony shared a video detailing the company's future plans for the next decade, including a look ahead at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-futuristic-controller-concept-brings-back-memories-of-the-ps3-boomerang">one possible concept for a futuristic PlayStation controller</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/strange-horticulture-sequel-strange-antiquities-officially-announced.879513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/strange-horticulture-sequel-strange-antiquities<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad Viking and Iceberg Entertainment have announced a followup to&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em>&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities</em>, and if you loved the first game's blend of cozy atmosphere and spooky horror, you're in for a treat, it seems.</p>

<p><em>Strange Horticulture&nbsp;</em>put you in charge of a shop selling all kinds of curious plants, and if you cared to uncover it, there was a spooky mystery lurking underneath the light puzzling as well.</p>

<p>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities&nbsp;</em>will continue that theme, only this time, your shop deals in curiosities of all stripes, not just botanical ones. It'll be set in the same town as&nbsp;<em>Horticulture</em>, though, so shop real estate must be insanely valuable there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/strange-antiquities-strange-horticulture-sequel-eli-white.jpg?itok=LvmiA-JC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/strange-antiquities-strange-horticulture-sequel-eli-white.jpg?itok=1KNjAbmG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to inherit your very own antiquities shop in&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities</em>?</figcaption></figure><p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Antiquities&nbsp;</em>will marry that peculiar kind of atmosphere you encounter in Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe-style places with an undercurrent of intrigue and macabre horror.</p>

<p>Residents of Undermere will come to you for help with various problems, and you'll need to help them unravel the mysteries of the objects they bring in, as well as objects you discover through other means.</p>

<p>The story begins when a flock of ravens begin circling Undermere, upon which occult expert Verona Green journeys to Undermere to talk things over with thaumaturge Eli White.</p>

<p>Things go awry, though, and Undermere soon finds itself drawn into yet another mystery that only you can solve. You can watch the (admittedly brief)&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities&nbsp;</em>reveal trailer right here.</p>




<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em>, you should still be able to understand&nbsp;<em>Antiquities</em>, but it'll likely contain some references that might go over your head.</p>

<p>Besides which,<em>&nbsp;Strange Horticulture&nbsp;</em>is pretty great, so if you're interested in what you see here and you haven't played the first game yet, I'd strongly recommend you do so.</p>

<p><em>Strange Antiquities&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC when it launches, although no release window has been revealed yet. You can take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/strange-horticulture-review">our review of&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture&nbsp;</em>here</a> if you want a refresher course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hints have been dropping for a while, but today Activision officially announced this year’s entry in the mega-blockbuster CoD franchise – Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. No subtitle like 2020’s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, they’re keeping it simple. You can check out the announcement tweet, below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A dark new chapter of the Black Ops franchise begins. Call of Duty: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://t.co/db3lPR0ibI">pic.twitter.com/db3lPR0ibI</a></p>
<p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1793635518648836544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to that, while many suspected it as Microsoft wasn’t being particularly sneaky, but the “Direct” being broadcast after <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June’s big Xbox Games Showcase</a> will indeed be a Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Join us at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxShowcase?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxShowcase</a> immediately followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> Direct, your first in-depth look at all-new gameplay and product announcements.</p>
<p>⏰ 10 AM PST Sunday June 9 <a href="https://t.co/sj2dUqg7Dw">https://t.co/sj2dUqg7Dw</a></p>
<p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1793639768125026788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p><em>“Full Reveal Date Confirmed: Xbox Games Showcase, Sunday June 9th at 10 AM PT. Black Ops 6 Direct immediately following. Stay on this channel for further updates.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-leaked-image-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we reported yesterday</a>, a teaser site and some “leaks” (most likely strategically placed by Activision) hinted that the reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was imminent. In particular, the teaser website <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thetruthlies.com</a> features a couple brief video clips that hint at the tone of the upcoming game. One of the videos shows some group making a statement by putting blindfolds reading “The Truth Lies” on the Presidential noggins of Mount Rushmore. Another teaser on the site shows the same group putting up posters featuring an image of the blindfolded Mt. Rushmore.</p>
<p>While we’ll have to wait for the full reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in June, rumors have stated it will be your typical shadowy Treyarch tale <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in and around the first Gulf War</a>. Whether it focuses specifically on the Gulf War of just that general early 90s period, remains to be seen. The Black Ops 6 Direct will also likely reveal how Microsoft plans to sell the game, as there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong rumors they plan to put it on Game Pass on Day 1</a>, which would obviously be a big shakeup for the series.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Excited to get your first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6? What’s your favorite Call of Duty sub-series?</p>

That game—which was a direct sequel to 2010's original <em>Black Ops—</em>ended with (spoiler!) a choice over whether to tell the truth or lie about the location of Soviet spy Perseus. The marketing for <em>Blops 6</em> seems centered around this moment, with a website called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thetruthlies.com/1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Lies</a></span> appearing this week.</p><p>This leaves the setting for the new game somewhat less ambiguous. <em>Cold War</em> was set in the 1980s, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-2024-black-ops-6-gulf-war-treyarch-1851043516&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-2024-black-ops-6-gulf-war-treyarch-1851043516">rumors swirled</a></span> at the end of last year that accurately predicted a Treyarch-developed <em>Black Ops</em> sequel, and suggested it would be set during the Gulf War. No, not that one, the one President Bush started. No, the <em>first</em> President Bush. Gulf War 1.</p><p>That makes a lot of chronological sense, as it’s the next big U.S.-involved conflict in which our intrepid team of shark-jumping, MKUltra-addled heroes could meddle within.</p><p>The mysterious The Truth Lies website sees Mount Rushmore’s stone presidents wearing giant blindfolds, bearing the same legend—the same image that appears in the mock newspaper story wrapped around <em>USA Today</em> today, and on the back page of <em>The New York Post</em>. The site loops a short video of some people fussing about on a road, getting into a car, and then seemingly climbing up Mount Rushmore to place the blindfolds, before admiring their work.</p><p> You can change TV channels on the site to see other equally badly shot short films, of people putting up The Truth Lies posters, a bunch of static fuzz, and then images of worldwide monuments similarly defaced. People on Reddit are also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarCallofDuty/comments/1cyrt27/black_ops_6_the_truth_lies_posters_in_new_york/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarCallofDuty/comments/1cyrt27/black_ops_6_the_truth_lies_posters_in_new_york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting images</a></span> they claim to be <em>Black Ops 6</em> posters pasted up in New York.</p><p>There you have it. You’re now expected to enthusiastically speculate about what it could all mean! I suggest just entirely dismissing the entire thing from your mind, until Activision inevitably offers something more coherent during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Studio has secured funding to remain independent</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Relic Entertainment has partnered with UK-based investment firm Emona Capital to become fully independent <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-sells-relic-and-will-cut-240-jobs-across-uk-studios">after being sold by Sega in March</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/relic-partners-with-investment-firm-to-go-fully-indie-again">Game Developer</a>, the studio has secured funding to stay independent through Emona Capital.</p>
<p>The investment firm will support the developer's current portfolio and will assist in creating partnerships with other publishers.</p>
<p>"We see a huge opportunity to unleash Relic's creative potential as an independent studio," said Relic CEO Justin Dowdeswell. "The talent, technology, and track record we have built over the years are an amazing starting point for us on this next chapter."</p>
<p>A week after its sale from Sega, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/relic-hit-with-layoffs-following-sale-from-sega">studio was hit with a wave of redundancies</a> in which 41 people were laid off.</p>
<p>Relic formed in 1997, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thq-split-up-at-auction">was acquired by Sega in 2013</a> following the bankruptcy of its previous owner THQ.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision Blizzard and Xbox have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, and we'll get to learn more about the game during Xbox's showcase next month.</p>

<p>When Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-june-showcase-direct-announced">announced its June showcase at the end of April</a>, it accompanied the announcement with a picture that featured a game's logo and publisher name obscured by black bars.</p>

<p>That publisher was pretty clearly Activision, and by extension, it was obvious to most that the game in question was&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>. The only ambiguity that remained was what the game would actually be called.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-showcase-rushmore.jpg?itok=P37CokP1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-showcase-rushmore.jpg?itok=SlBRQO4A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ooh, evocative.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the announcement of the game itself, the first teaser for&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has been released.</p>

<p>It's a short one, clocking in at just 40 seconds or so, and it shows a couple of figures traipsing up to Mount Rushmore, where the four iconic heads have had their eyes obscured by blindfolds that read "THE TRUTH LIES".</p>

<p>The teaser is simply titled "wake up (rushmore)", which makes it sound like a comeback song by a classic 2000s indie band. It's not, though, and you can check it out right here.</p>




<p>With&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, Xbox and Activision are apparently pulling a&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator 3</em>, skipping&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 5</em>&nbsp;(although the intervening game <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">does actually exist in this case</a>).</p>

<p>This also puts the kibosh on the idea that the game would be called&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War</em>, which, if you ask me, is a slightly more interesting title than the straightforward numbering that Activision has opted for.</p>

<p>Still,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is now official, and we'll get to learn more about it during the Xbox showcase in June. That showcase is scheduled to air on June 9th at 10am Pacific or your local equivalent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162545/bridgerton-lord-debling-colin-penelope-love-triangle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9cUwGn">In the new season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156775/bridgerton-season-3-part-1-review-netflix-polin-3a"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>, it’s Colin’s turn to get the leading man treatment. He comes back from his time abroad with a new found swagger — and a sexy coat — and all the ladies of the Ton notice. (And his brothers tease him for his newfound “sturdiness.”) He’s not the baby-faced idealist from season 1; nay, now he knows how to get down and dirty, and that makes it even sexier when he realizes that he’s actually in love with his long time friend Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). </p>
<p id="Wfbv65">But Penelope, who realizes she cannot bear to live under the thumb of her controlling mother any longer, has her eyes set on what she believes is a more attainable marriage prospect: Lord Debling (Sam Phillips), a reclusive lord who’s set on finding a wife this season. </p>
<p id="2UU8FM">Now Lord Debling isn’t exactly popular himself, though according to the gentleman of the Ton, his biggest crimes are that he 1) is a vegetarian, 2) likes animals a lot to the point where his is determined to save endangered species, and 3) he doesn’t like cavorting in high society and would rather go on long expeditions to faroff regions and leave his estate behind.</p>
<p id="UnOAj2">To that I say: the Ton’s gentlemen are idiots and Lord Debling is an absolute catch! </p>
<p id="MjSJVa">He has interests that <em>aren’t</em> drinking, gambling, or having sex with prostitutes. He’s passionate and has ambitions and drive. He sparks to Penelope when she’s being herself. They have a connection, both being shunned by society for entirely trivial reasons, and they share meaningful conversations. Practically, a dude who is away for large swaths of time and doesn’t concern himself with the gossip of the Ton is a <em>great</em> match for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995119/bridgerton-lady-whistledown-spoiler">Lady Whistledown</a>. She’d be free to build her gossip empire without worrying about her husband busting her spot, or the pressure of producing heirs (as her sisters are currently experiencing). </p>

<p id="ogxcKG">Of course, because this is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157362/bridgerton-queer-characters-benedict-eloise-brimsley"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>, Penelope Featherington wants both her gossip empire and a love that sweeps her off her feet (and she deserves that!). So it is Colin who chases after her carriage and professes his love to her at the end of part one. We’ll have to wait and see how the Whistledown of it all effects their blossoming relationship, but this is a series full of happy endings (not to mention, one that solidly uses Lady Whistledown as a framing device and marketing tool), so it’s likely Penelope will find a way to balance both loves of her life. </p>
<p id="WS0WSH">There’s still half a season (due out in June) for Colin to prove that he’s worthy of Penelope, but as of right now, all he’s really done is realize she’s beautiful after kissing her. Sure, he’s apologized for the hurtful things he said in previous seasons, and he helped her in her pursuit to find a husband. But just because he’s gotten a bit of a makeover and now has more confidence, doesn’t mean he’s a worthwhile suitor. What are his passions? C<em>an</em> he respect Penelope’s own pursuits? What does he feel about her that’s not just “my best friend who’s been by my side forever, and also I realize she’s hot now”? The Lady Whistledown of all of this will certainly develop in the next half of the season, but Lord Debling already saw Penelope for something more than just a wallflower and best bud.  </p>
<p id="PUbbsD">But once Lord Debling’s suspicions about Colin and Penleope’s feelings are confirmed, he graciously bows out of the love triangle. He knows he probably cannot love Penelope the way she wants (or deserves!), and with full confirmation that her heart is elsewhere he tells her as much. Yes, it’s a bit of a bummer at the moment, especially since Penelope hasn’t yet learned that Colin’s dumb in love with her. But it’s been clear from the beginning that Debling will always prioritize his passions over his wife, and any marriage for him would’ve been closer to a business transaction built on trust and understanding. </p>
<p id="Qps8m7">So, when he rejects Penelope it’s not because he’s worried or hurt that she’ll cheat on him with Colin when he’s abroad (honestly, he doesn’t seem like the type of guy who’d actually care what his wife does when he’s gone), but because he’s not about to trap her in a loveless marriage. He knows she deserves more, and he’s giving her a chance to have it! Sure, it might hurt in the moment, but the fact he’s willing to step back says a lot about his character. </p>
<p id="1AnopU">I don’t think he wants to find romance, but I am rooting for him to get everything he wants: a nice wife who is more than content to run his estate (Cressida Cowper, now’s your chance to swoop in) and a chance to save an endangered species. And since this is a work of fantasy, maybe he <em>does</em> save the great auk before it goes extinct in 1844. If anyone can do it, it’s Lord Debling. </p>

<p>Following recent leaks pointing toward a full reveal of Black Ops 6 in the coming days, people want more. I want more! We all want to learn as much as possible about the upcoming first-person shooter. More specifically, when is the Black Ops 6 beta?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-black-ops-6-beta-start">When Does the Black Ops 6 Beta Start?</h2>



<p>As of right now, we don’t have an official date for the beta of Black Ops 6. However, we can look back at past Call of Duty titles, like the one for Modern Warfare 3, to help us discern the potential launch of this year’s Call of Duty beta. Last year, you could play the beta from October 8 to October  16, a short period to experience the gameplay and gunplay of the latest FPS release.</p>



<p>Typically speaking, most Call of Duty titles are released in October or November, and those with a beta usually occur in the first two weeks of October. We fully expect the Black Ops 6 beta in early October 2024.</p>



<p>We’ve heard reports that Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 25</a>. If that’s the case, then an early October beta would make the most sense, though late September is definitely in the cards, too!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-include-zombies">Does Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Include Zombies?</h2>



<p>We know that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will feature a brand-new iteration of the ever-popular zombies game mode. It’s said to include two new maps, new weapons and equipment, unique traps to help slay the undead, and more.</p>



<p>However, we don’t know if Zombies will feature in the upcoming Black Ops 6 beta. It’s possible and more than likely, but not a guarantee at this time.</p>

<p>While we eagerly await the full reveal of Black Ops 6, check out what else Insider Gaming is up to these days:</p>

<p>Xbox has confirmed that the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 reveal <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-2024-redacted-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will take place on Sunday, June 9</a> as part of the Xbox  Games Showcase. Immediately after the showcase, Xbox will hold an in-depth Black Ops 6 Direct to go into more detail on the upcoming game.</p>



<p>In addition to the announcement, the game’s official logo was also revealed, which you can see in the featured image above.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-gulf-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier reported</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will take place during the Gulf War of the early 1990s. The new game is expected to embrace <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-gulf-war-campaign-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a more open-world campaign</a> as the start of a new focus for the series. It was also seemingly confirmed that both Raven Software and Treyarch are working on the game together, as reported by Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>There are no other details regarding what the reveal will include, but fans should expect to see information about all of the major features coming to the game. That includes the campaign, Warzone, multiplayer, and more.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to release in late October. Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes that October 25</a> is the current target date. It’s also been reported that Call of Duty is coming to Xbox Game Pass with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-to-make-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-tiers-because-of-call-of-duty-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possible pricing and tier changes</a> as part of the addition.</p>

                <p>Embracer has released its latest earnings briefing, and included in the report is some accounting for how the Alone in the Dark reboot performed commercially.</p><p>The company said the game <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">didn't do as well as it hoped</a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-flopped-embracer-says-after-laying-off-staff" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), recording "softer-than-expected performance." Embracer used this language to describe the commercial performance of Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning, both of which were published by THQ Nordic.</p><p>Embracer never said what its sales expectations for Alone in the Dark were in the first place, nor did the company reveal a sales number for the game now. The title launched on March 20 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-best-selling-games-for-march-2024-in-the-us/2900-5344/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5344">did not crack the top 20 best-seller chart for March in the US.</a></p><p>The Alone in the Dark reboot stars David Harbour (Black Widow, Stranger Things) and Jodie Comer (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Killing Eve). Prior to launch, Harbour discussed how Alone in the Dark was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-harbour-says-alone-in-the-dark-was-limited-in-scope-wants-to-do-a-full-motion-capture-game/1100-6517017/" data-ref-id="1100-6517017">not everything he hoped it would be from an acting perspective. </a></p><p>Harbour also said he never worked in the same space with Comer on the game, and he said this was "tragic." He said Alone in the Dark is a "wacky franchise" and that some of the games in the series were "terrible."</p><p>He added that the motion-capture process wasn't a "full-born" experience. It was "just me and some dots on my face in a room," he said.</p><p>In other Embracer news, the company recently conducted a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-ceo-says-he-deserves-criticism-after-mass-layoffs-and-game-cancellations/1100-6522874/" data-ref-id="1100-6522874">cost-cutting and restructuring program that included mass layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures. </a> Embracer will ditch that name soon, as the company instead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-ceo-says-he-deserves-criticism-after-mass-layoffs-and-game-cancellations/1100-6522874/" data-ref-id="1100-6522874">splits into three distinct companies.</a></p><p>Lars Wingefors, the CEO of Embracer, is staying on with the company and will become the top boss at all three companies. He has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-ceo-says-he-deserves-criticism-after-mass-layoffs-and-game-cancellations/1100-6522874/" data-ref-id="1100-6522874">he deserves criticism for what he did</a> that led to this situation, but told investors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-ceo-says-he-deserves-criticism-after-mass-layoffs-and-game-cancellations/1100-6522874/" data-ref-id="1100-6522874">it was the right thing to do.</a></p>

        <p>Publication has partnered with ESL FaceIt Group for launch</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Rolling Stone has returned to games media by launching a new section, Rolling Stone Gaming.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rolling-stone-launches-gaming-vertical-with-help-from-saudi-wealth-fund">Game Developer</a>, the section will be headed by senior gaming editor Christopher Cruz, who was previously an executive producer of the site's content studio which included its daily show Rolling Stone on Twitch.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone Gaming launched in partnership with ESL FaceIt Group owned by Savvy Games Group, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-is-savvy-games-group-and-how-is-it-trying-to-change-saudi-arabias-image">a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>.</p>
<p>The PIF has previously purchased stakes in Capcom, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-acquires-usd1bn-stake-in-embracer-group">Embracer</a>, Nexon, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-increases-stake-in-nintendo-to-708">Nintendo</a> over the past few years, in addition to Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-increases-stake-in-electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that Rolling Stone has covered gaming. Back in 2016, it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rolling-stone-publisher-launching-gaming-site">launched its gaming vertical Glixel</a> with industry veteran John Davison as the site's general manager.</p>
<p>A year later, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/glixels-san-francisco-office-closed-team-laid-off">Glixel's San Francisco office was shut down</a> and all of its staff were laid off.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuthering-waves-waveplate-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-more-and-what-to-spend-it-on.879435/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-waveplate-how-to-get-more-and-what-to-spend-it-on/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wuthering-waves-waveplate-how-to-get-more-and-what-to-spend-it-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="137" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Waveplate is hands-down the most important part of the early game in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, but it is also super easy to mess up and waste it. </p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">You will really want to know as much as you can about Waveplate in order to take full advantage of it and get your hands on the best resource for the early game. In this guide, I’ll tell you everything you need to know.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-waveplate-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to get more Waveplate in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true"><strong>To get Waveplate, you just need to let it recharge</strong>. It will do so at a rate of one Waveplate per six minutes. This means that for every hour, you earn ten Waveplate. The currency has a limit of 240 that can be held at any one time, which means if you are at zero, then within 24 hours, you will be maxed out and will need to spend some to take advantage of the recharge rate. </p>
 <p data-characters="525" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Now, should you need a lot of Waveplate in a hurry, you can use items called Crystal Solvents. That will instantly restore 60 Waveplate. These Solvents can be obtained via gift codes or the Battle Pass and are a great way to store Waveplate, so only use them when you really need to power-level something. If you wish, you can also convert 60 Astrite to 60 Waveplate a total of six times a day. This is not something that I recommend, frankly. While there are <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-astrite-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many ways to get Astrite</a>, you really want to save it for Banners</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to use your Waveplate</h2> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Waveplate can be used to get all manner of rewards, including the items and resources that you will need to level up characters and weapons. That said, some of the ways you can use it are just not really worth it, as the associated rewards can be easily obtained via other means.</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Simulation Training</strong> – this costs 40 Waveplate and will reward you with both character and weapon experience materials, union experience, and credits. <strong>It is NOT WORTH DOING</strong> unless you absolutely need to spend some Waveplate or desperately need the experience materials from this. You can get all these items via much better means just by playing the game.</li> <li><strong>World Bosses</strong> – A good place to spend some Waveplates is on World Bosses for Ascension materials. <strong>You do NOT need to spend it on farming echoes</strong>, as the echoes drop independently from the Ascension materials. In the early game, these Ascension materials are the best possible way to spend them. Just make sure you are farming the right boss to get the materials for the characters you actually wish to upgrade.</li> <li><strong>Tacet Fields </strong>–<strong> </strong>These are good to farm, but you should likely wait until you reach the maximum possible level for them, as then you will be farming the best drops. Until then, I would argue the World Boss farms make more sense. Get to Data Bank Rank 15, and then you can start farming these efficiently. </li> <li><strong>Forgery Challenge</strong> – another solid way to spend Waveplate, this will give you weapon materials. </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Ultimately, the important thing is not to sit there with 240 Waveplates, as you will not earn any more. If you are about to finish up for the day and go to sleep for 8 hours, the important thing is to spend some so that you can earn them back while you sleep in the pesky real world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-as-2024s-cod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This year’s COD has been confirmed to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as Activision follow up on a teaser site and leaked newspaper advertising with a formal announcement. The game will debut during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-and-a-redacted-direct-confirmed-for-june-9th/">Xbox Showcase on 9th June</a> with a Black Ops 6 Direct to follow immediately afterwards.</p>
<p><iframe title="wake up (rushmore) #thetruthlies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxIHyfwUrTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The advertising came with copies of USA Today in a promotional supplement that show’s the game’s logo, title and some in-universe news stories. In particular there’s the defacing of Mount Rushmore, which also appeared on <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/6/">the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 teaser website</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>That teaser site features an analogue TV which you can scroll through six channels, some of which give static, but the first of which shows Mount Rushmore’s defacement, and the sixth of which tunes in to News 6, with faux reporting of monuments around the world also being defaced.</p>
<p>Activision are building up to the full reveal of this year’s Call of Duty at the Xbox showcase at Summer Games Fest on 9th June. That showcase will be followed by a deep-dive into a game, secretively called ‘Redacted Direct’, but now rebranded as Black Ops 6 Direct.</p>

<p>2024 will be a huge year for Call of Duty. This will be the first game in the series released after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, and it will also come after a relative down year for the franchise, the back-to-back development of Modern Warfare III not exactly being a high-point. Returning to the popular Black Ops setting could be the boost that company execs want to see.</p>
<p>However, there’s also reports that Microsoft will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/report-call-of-duty-2024-will-come-to-xbox-game-pass-on-day-one/">throwing Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 straight into Xbox Game Pass</a>, potentially undermining the strong yearly sales of the game in an attempt to boost subscriber counts. This could also see Microsoft shake up the Game Pass price structure for the first time since Game Pass Ultimate was introduced.</p>

More than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs this year across the video game industry.
</p>
<p>
That's according to an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">archive tallying layoffs across the industry</a>, which has now hit an estimated total of 10,100 people.
</p>
<p>
For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning almost as many have been impacted so far in 2024 in less than half the time.

The archive lists layoffs by individual studio, publisher, or company, with Activision Blizzard having the most layoffs at 1900. This is followed by Unity with 1800, PlayStation Studios with 900, EA with 670, and Take Two with 600 (some of these numbers are approximate).

Some companies are listed but with an unknown number of people affected, while others are not yet included - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">Square Enix, for instance, has reportedly been impacted by an unknown number of layoffs</a> across its US and European offices.

</p>
<p>
Grouping together by parent company also reveals Microsoft has laid off at least 2150 people across its studios - the most of any company listed.
</p>
<p>
Coupled with 2023, over 20,000 people have lost their jobs in the video game industry in less than 18 months - an incredibly sobering statistic and indictment of the state of the industry.
</p>
<p>
Have layoffs reached an apex? It's impossible to say what the future holds, although you would expect the situation to settle for the foreseeable.
</p>
<p>
At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">Embracer</a> - one of the biggest contributors to layoffs from 2023-2024 - has now "successfully finalised" its restructuring programme. Its headcount has dropped by 4532 in the past 12 months.

</p>
<p>
"The layoffs will slow down. Most of the big companies have made their moves now, and hopefully they won't need to go further (some analysts speaking to GamesIndustry.biz believe companies may now need to hire back up within a few years). But the pain isn't over," wrote GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring for Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">the state of video game layoffs</a>.

</p>
<p>
"With so many people out of work, and so few jobs out there, you might expect to see new studios form. We will get a few, but with investors being increasingly conservative, the reality is that a lot of these artists, programmers, designers, producers, writers, and others will have to leave the games business to find work. I'm writing this article from a cold business point-of-view, but there's no denying the horrible human cost of this 'correction'. The anger towards executives, shareholders, and capitalism in general, is more than understandable."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-intellivision-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it has acquired the Intellivision brand and game library, putting to rest a 45-year-old rivalry between the two classic gaming companies.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://atari.com/blogs/newsroom/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Atari website, the company says it's bought the brand and "certain games" from Intellivision Entertainment LLC, whose name might still be in your recent memory thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaked-intellivision-amico-documents-paint-grim-picture">disastrous Amico debacle</a>.</p>

<p>That debacle may well be set to continue, though, because Atari says it hasn't acquired that aspect of the business. Instead, Intellivision Entertainment will apparently rebrand and continue distributing the Amico. Atari is also granting the company a license to distribute newer versions of Intellivision games on the Amico. Ow, my head.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-intellivision-purchase-amico.jpg?itok=zHF7ELYO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-intellivision-purchase-amico.jpg?itok=rP-RrC1X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This thing isn't included in Atari's purchase of Intellivision, and I'm sure Atari is relieved.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Atari, the legendary retro gaming company will "seek to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games", and new games under the brand name might also be on the cards.</p>

<p>Atari also says that the console war between itself and its (now-former) rival is "arguably...the first console war of consequence" and "the longest-running console war in history", although I'm not sure either participant was particularly interested in fighting towards the end.</p>

<p>More than 200 Intellivision properties, along with the Intellivision trademark itself, are included in this purchase, but Atari doesn't specify what those 200 properties actually are.</p>

<p>Still, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-problems-cause-significant-staff-layoffs">disastrous</a> history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-future-in-doubt-as-creators-admit-massive-debt">the Amico</a> and the reputation of its "visionary" Tommy Tallarico, it's arguable Atari has bought the best parts of Intellivision and left the most toxic ones behind.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-50-intellivision.jpg?itok=XaXrFoqW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-50-intellivision.jpg?itok=Rzow9f16 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could an Intellivision retrospective collection akin to <em>Atari 50&nbsp;</em>be on the cards?</figcaption></figure><p>Atari CEO Wade Rosen, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-ceo-offers-to-buy-atari-after-rough-year">purchased the company back in late 2022</a>, describes the Intellivision purchase as "a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors" and bring together retro gaming fans of all stripes.</p>

<p>Intellivision Entertainment head Phil Adam, meanwhile, says he's confident Atari will be a "responsible steward of the storied Intellivision brand".</p>

<p>It's not yet clear what kind of games or projects this purchase will yield, but expect Atari to dig deep into the Intellivision vaults to see what it can salvage. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Embracer Group said that the Alone in the Dark reboot failed to meet expectations after its March 2024 release. The announcement came as part of <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s latest earnings report</a> released on Thursday.</p>



<p>The company says that the reboot of the 1990s classic franchise had a “softer-than-expected performance”. They added that despite seeing a “positive reception from users”, the game, along with Outcast: A New Beginning, had a “mixed reception from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.”</p>



<p>This performance that Embracer viewed as negative could be viewed as what led to developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-lays-off-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pieces Interactive having layoffs</a> just a month after its launch. As of writing, Embracer Group had yet to publicly comment on the layoffs. However, the studio did announce around the same time as the layoffs that it was set to split into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three different companies</a>.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of the game</a>, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said that he didn’t feel like he could “reliably advocate for buying Alone in the Dark at full price.”</p>



<p>He added: “It’s not&nbsp;<strong>terrible</strong>, but there’s just something lacking that doesn’t allow the player to experience satisfaction at any point throughout the story.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-will-rework-economy-console-release-window-shrinking/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/upcoming-patch-content.1681104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on the Paradox forum, an upcoming update for Cities Skylines 2 will rework the economy system. </p>



<p>The update will improve management, challenges, and clarification for the consequences of player actions. The developers clarify that the update is still “currently being polished,” and it “will not address everything.” </p>



<p>At this time, the team is aiming to release the patch somewhere between June 3 and 19, 2024. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In addition to the Cities Skylines 2 economy, Paradox’s new forum post also gives fans an update on the console builds. The devs state that they “still hope we can keep the timeline for an October release.” </p>



<p>However, they also warned fans that “it might have to be delayed further.” This follows the results of various stability tests on a Beta build delivery last April. </p>



<p>Cities Skylines 2 has faced a variety of issues, including the launch of its recent DLC. Paradox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-apologizes-again-after-even-more-cities-skylines-2-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even apologized</a> over the state of the game last April. </p>



<p>So, it may be particularly wise for the team to spend enough time to roll out smooth console builds. Fortunately, the devs did work to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-is-finally-getting-mod-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduce mod support</a> in March, a highly requested feature from longtime fans.</p>



<p>Paradox just recently slowed down Life By You, retracting its Early Access release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-pulls-life-by-you-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this week</a>. Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja simply explained that “additional development time is needed” for Life By You.</p>
