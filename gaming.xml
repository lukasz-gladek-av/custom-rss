            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Sues Palworld Developer for "Patent Infringement"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-patent-infringement.985395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it is suing&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair for "patent infringement", seeking an injunction against said infringement alongside "compensation for damages".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notice for the lawsuit on its official website</a>, Nintendo says that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>"infringes multiple patent rights" it holds, although the Japanese gaming giant naturally doesn't go into any more detail regarding what those patents might be.</p>
<p>The notice is characteristically brief; Nintendo concludes by simply saying that it "will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights, including the Nintendo brand itself". That <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-garrys-mod-takedowns">sounds like</a> Nintendo, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-sues-creators-of-switch-emulator-yuzu">alright</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=SFylnIaY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=xR2pOE33 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo has turned its ever-present legal gaze on&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair.</figcaption></figure><p>Responding to the lawsuit <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1836692701355688146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Pocketpair says it is currently "unaware of the specific patents" it's being accused of infringing, and Nintendo has not "notified" the studio of these details.</p>
<p>Pocketpair goes on to say that it is "truly unfortunate" for the studio to have to "allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development" as a result of the lawsuit, but that the developer is determined to make sure fellow studios "are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas".</p>
<p>This may well be the culmination of a promise issued by The Pokemon Company back in January, whereupon the media giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-company-issues-statement-about-palworld-as-game-passes-8-million-copies-sold">said it would investigate</a> any potential infringement on its intellectual property rights pertaining to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>wasn't named in that declaration, but context strongly suggested it was the game to which The Pokemon Company was referring. The announcement of the lawsuit arguably adds further fuel to that particular fire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-exploration.jpg?itok=YKRLRyHD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-exploration.jpg?itok=uC-KL9KW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is, it's an open-world survival action-RPG developed by Japanese indie studio Pocketpair. Released earlier this year, the game sees players befriending (or potentially enslaving)&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures called Pals.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>allows you either to pit your Pals against other wild Pals or trainers, and you can also recruit them to help you build your base. You can, as Pocketpair says on the game's Steam page, "even sell them or eat them" if you wish.</p>
<p>Although comparisons were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">immediately drawn to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>arguably bears more of a resemblance to games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>, although Nintendo clearly doesn't think so.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9nkv34xdw014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. Stay tuned for more on this lawsuit and all other things&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>-related, including its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal">expansion into the world beyond video games</a>.</p>

"Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim says Krafton wanted to "acquire as many people as possible from Tango to continue their legacy," with the studio having been </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-closes-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-alpha-dog-studios">shuttered by Microsoft in May</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The South Korean company, best known for developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was also rather smitten with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and sought to acquire the IP to develop sequels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fans really want to see sequels, we negotiated with Tango Gameworks' parent company [Microsoft] to acquire that IP as well," he continues. According to Kim, the sudden shutdown of Tango Gameworks left employees "anxious," which is pushing Krafton to complete the deal as soon as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to make sure the deal happen fast to minimize that gap in their career," he adds. Kim says the scale and complexity of a conglomerate like Microsoft meant it was difficult to move quickly, but noted the Xbox maker was "open" to the sale of both the studio and its IP.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given Krafton felt the move was time sensitive, the company focused on purchasing the Hi-Fi Rush franchise as opposed to Tango's entire IP slate–which also includes The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much. Krafton is a pretty big company, but Microsoft is very complicated," he says. "We wanted to help the team continue developing their games, but especially </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When I think about our fans, I think what they really care about is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sequels."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The acquisition is still being finalized, preventing Kim from disclosing how much Krafton has spent on the Japanese studio. He did, however, describe the purchase as "not too expensive, or too cheap either."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We cannot really translate the volume into money. It's more about the significance," he adds. "The dollar amount was not really important to Microsoft."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1823815934458650940">It was previously reported by Game File</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that Krafton has brought over 50 employees from Tango Gameworks, representing around half of the development team as it existed under Microsoft. The aim now is to help the studio rescale and perhaps even expand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think a minimum of 100 people [is what we're aiming for]. We have to scale it to around that size. That's a minimum requirement to continue developing the franchise. Or perhaps they'll need a bigger team. We haven't decided on that, but we don't plan to reduce the size of the team at all," says Kim.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They have to work on new projects as well, so there is a great possibility the team will scale up even further."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Krafton boss hoping to acquire more studios like Tango Gameworks">Krafton boss hoping to acquire more studios like Tango Gameworks</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for what expectations Krafton has for the studio, Kim hopes to champion creativity without fear of failure. He claims Krafton will strive to take risks to produce titles that feel innovative rather than derivative. "We're trying to increase our portfolio lineup and Tango Gameworks comes into play [there]," he says, noting that many of Tango's previous games "may not even have broken even."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can't acquire Tango Gameworks based on their financials or their numbers, right? We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank," he continues. "But it's part of our attempt. We have to keep trying [to develop games] in the spirit of challenge-taking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Tango Gameworks are creative. They want to try something new, and we want to do more of that. [Making] video games is really a hit or miss industry, and that is risk taking. But having more project lineups is actually a way to mitigate risk, because one of them might work out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed on whether </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a commercial success for Microsoft, Kim says he doesn't know exactly how much the game earned, but when considering production costs he feels it might not have delivered a substantial return.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Did it add a lot of money to Microsoft? That might not be the case," he says. "I'm not saying I know how much they made–this is just my guess. But the IP itself was very fresh [and featured] new types of gameplay. I know it's not a game a lot of studios were making, and we have to keep trying [that approach]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim suggests corporations like Krafton shouldn't aspire to deliver an infinite procession of chart-topping hits, largely because that's a wildly unrealistic aim. Instead, he feels the goal should be to "break even" while nurturing creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Just recoup the production costs, please, is what I say. But that in itself is a pretty big challenge. If you try doing that, you might actually land a big hit. I don't trust people who say 'oh, this is going to be a hit.'

		<p>Former Minecraft console developers 4J Studios has announced Reforj, a fresh spin on the blocky sandbox survival game, with exploration, crafting and discovery at its core.</p>
<p>Reforj is being built on the studio’s new in-house Elements Engine, which has been designed from the ground up to enable voxel-based graphics and a sandbox that you can bend to your will, as well as online multiplayer. The studio had announced the Elements Engine a few months ago, though has now confirmed that it’s Reforj that they’re building within it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing... the Elements Engine" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wa7rTm56bw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is currently in a pre-alpha stage, but 4J are keen to start building a community around their project and will build it alongside their feedback.</p>
<p>4J Studios spent the better part of the 2010s bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/minecraft">Minecraft</a> to consoles, with a hand in the original 360 release, then PS3, Xbox One, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U and the initial Nintendo Switch edition of the game. However, their time working on the game came to an end as Mojang decided to move on from the console editions that they had produced, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/09/minecraft-bedrock-edition-ps4-release-date-free-updae-1-14/">aiming to unite the player base on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition instead</a> – something not universally pleasing to fans, it should be said.</p>


<p>Of course, there’s pretty much no way that Reforj can really contend with the vast player base and mindshare that Minecraft has built up, as one of the best-selling video games of all time, but 4J Studios could absolutely carve a little niche out from that and still be very successful. The key will be striking a balance between familiarity to Minecraft’s core formula, making adjustments and improvements to that, and introducing new idea of their own.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-price-is-a-test-to-see-customer%E2%80%99s-tolerance-a-bad-press-cycle-may-not-have-many-lasting-consequences.985377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's high price is likely a test of customers' tolerance for highly-priced gaming hardware, and the related bad press cycle could be part of Sony's bigger strategy for the future.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Massive Damage Studios art director Bryan Meemskerk made some interesting observations about the upcoming system. According to the developer, Sony made a lot of good hardware decisions for its current generation mid-generation refresh, with one exception: the lack of a disc drive. While this sounds like a tone-deaf decision, considering the system is aimed at a hardcore audience, the same audience that mostly buys physical games, the lack of a disc drive is as much of a test as the high price is. As the attachable disc drive is essentially sold out almost everywhere, now Sony knows that there's demand for this type of accessory and may release a discless PlayStation 6 compatible with the PS5's attachable disc drive.</p>
<p>The most important test, however, remains the PlayStation 5 Pro's high price. Bryan Meemskerk noted how Sony likely saw what NVIDIA and Apple did in recent times and attempted to follow suit. In the case of NVIDIA, the company did not suffer any major consequences from a cycle of bad press caused by the high price of some of its top-of-the-line products. On the contrary, Meemskerk pointed out that consumers tend to forgive when the price of next-generation hardware is slightly lower than that of the previous generation, making the negative press cycle over an expensive halo product ultimately inconsequential and possibly worthwhile. Also, the high cost of the PlayStation 5 Pro could make the base console more appealing due to its lower price.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Developer Analysis, AMD Zen 5 Fine Wine, RDNA 4, UDNA | Bryan Heemskerk | Broken Silicon 275" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5v-U_Dk5oRA?start=653&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro's price is undoubtedly high for a gaming console, the system offers plenty of improvements over the base system that will allow for smooth 60 FPS at 4K resolution. As highlighted by an early analysis shared online <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">yesterday</a>, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be among the existing PS5 games that will benefit the most from the system's better specs.</p>

            <p>The mad lads at Square Enix have released a demo for their remake of 90s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven</a>, in which you play a whole dynasty of customisable protagonists fighting vengeful ancient heroes. It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complimentary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday. </p><!--more-->

<p>The demo gives you the beginning of the tale, ending with a battle against Kzinssie, one of the aforesaid malingering heroes. New to SaGa and worrying that you’ll need to play the first one before sampling the remake? Be of good cheer, my child: according to producer Shinichi Tatsuke, Revenge Of The Seven “has no connection to the rest of the SaGa franchise in terms of worldview or storyline” and “is designed to be easy to pick up even for beginners” thanks to some apparently ample tutorials and a choice of difficulty modes.</p>
<p>We ran through some of the remake’s new features in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-are-remaking-a-classic-90s-rpg-about-defending-an-empire-from-a-bunch-of-spiteful-ancient-heroes">our announcement post</a>, but I cannot expect you, a weary denizen of websites, to swim back through the sluggish tides of the internet and peruse something we published a whole <em>three months ago</em>. As Revenge Of The Seven’s story demonstrates, time marches forever onward, grinding away at the cartilage in the very finger joints we might use to click on links to the past. So here’s Tatsuke’s just-circulated breakdown instead. I hope your finger joints are still functioning well enough to scroll the page:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of new features in this remake! There are new episodes from the Seven Heroes’ pasts, the battle system has been updated with increased strategic elements through United Attacks and the timeline, we’ve added new areas for character growth with abilities, plus new classes, new formations, new techniques, and new spells. There’s also upgraded facility development and equipment crafting in the game, in addition to new mini-games, such as the University Exams and Mr. S Finder. I’m also happy to share we’ve added three difficulty modes to choose from, fully voiced event scenes with English and Japanese voice acting, the soundtrack has been completely redone, and we’ve included the option to toggle between the rearranged version and the original retro music… There’s quite a lot, and even more for players to discover in the full game!</p></blockquote>
<p>Tatsuke also has some advice for battle – strike at enemy weaknesses to fill up an Overdrive gauge and perform a big-ass United Attack, basically – and some comments on the Lineage system, which is the aspect of Revenge Of The Seven I find most intriguing, inasmuch as it pongs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings</a>.</p>
<p>“There is a limit to the techniques, spells and such powers that a single emperor can learn,” he notes. “However, these powers can be passed down through generations to emperors of various classes, which will ultimately help birth emperors with overwhelming powers. You’ll need to accumulate several generations worth of power and experience in order to defeat all of the Seven Heroes.”</p>
<p>OK, so it doesn't quite sound like there are the raw materials for another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-a-crusader-kings-3-ruler-with-every-setting-on-maximum">Gigaknight Excelsior</a> here, but I live in hope of some kind of surprise in-breeding mechanic and a touch of filial backstabbing. Failing that, the combat system looks fairly jolly and there are a lot of classes and abilities to pick from.</p>
<p>The Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven remake will launch on 24th October 2024. The team behind it also worked on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gather-your-party-and-venture-forth-in-trials-of-manas-free-demo%E2%80%9D">Trials Of Mana remake</a>, which appears to be popularly regarded as a “good game”. If you own one of those "Switch" things and have access to Nintendo's eShop, I hear the demo is also available there too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm in the cat shelter and the woman you play as, Olive, is coughing and the screen is going blurry. The elderly woman in the cat shelter is ill and the music is sad and it is so shameless that I cannot stop howling. At least I got to pick which epic skin I wanted for my cat.</p>

<p>As someone who recently adopted a cat, this is what happened: I filled in a normal, boring form, had a phone call, someone popped round to make sure I didn’t have any pythons, and I got a cat. Note how the shelter's letterhead just says 'cat shelter', and also note how the contents of the form read like they were written at the point of a gun, held by a cat. </p>
<p>I’m the cat now. Olive lets me out in her house and feeds me a bowl of food that looks like soggy Wotsits. The telephone rings, and the game breaks into a sort of Far Cry 3 drug sequence where I have to run away scared from the ringing. I hide under some cabinets. The phone call was Olive’s daughter saying how worried she was about Olive’s illness. Olive asked for a hug afterward and the game gave me two options, both of which involved refusing to offer comfort to this dying elderly woman. Olive sadly bumbles out of the room, then tells me she’s leaving the house to go to the pharmacy. She’s ill, remember.</p>
<p>When she’s gone, I steal her chicken. This is an objective, by the way. I don’t get a say in the matter.</p>

<p>Yep. Classic bathroom sausage. Here's a Steam description:</p>
<blockquote>We follow the tale of Dawn, a sceptical shelter cat who would much rather be in the wild than be readopted again. Dawn actually believes she is a wild cat. And plans on escaping as soon as she gets the chance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-tears-of-the-kingdoms-creativity-to-a-new-dimension<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For many fans, a Zelda game where you <em>actually</em> play as Zelda is enough reason to be excited for the latest instalment, but The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom truly shines by showing what we can expect from the series in a post-Tears of the Kingdom world. </p><p>Solving puzzles has always been at the heart of this iconic Nintendo franchise since it began in 1986, but as the series evolved, so too did the puzzles Link was tasked with finding solutions to. We first saw this major change in Breath of the Wild with tests and shrines dotted across the map for pit stop–speed challenges. Its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, evolved this into new building mechanics like Ultrahand and Fuse, transforming Hyrule into a sandbox, with a world intuitively designed in its verticality and obstacles to require all kinds of creative contraptions. This synergy between a versatile range of abilities and a cohesive open world design carries on into the future of traditional top down Zelda with Echoes of Wisdom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-002-scrn-1725980140402.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>No rest for the wise...</figcaption></figure></output><p>Set in the familiar land of Hyrule, our expected hero, Link, has been lost and it is up to Zelda to traverse the world, defeat monsters, and overcome challenging dungeons using the “echoes” she learns on her adventures. This new summoning power is granted by Tri, the helpful companion of our journey, and the staff bestowed to our heroine called the Tri Rod. Echoes range from inanimate objects you may find by snooping in the homes of villagers, such as beds and pots and tables, to the many fearsome foes you face on your travels, like Keese and Moblins. Every echo has a cost, which depending on Tri's power level, means you're limited by how many echoes you can have active at once. Beds can be slept in to recover health, pots can be hidden in for stealth missions, and rocks can be hurled at foes in a pinch. When defeated for the first time,  foes can be learned as echoes, and when summoned, are loyal to you, but they will retain their animalistic instincts and desires so may not always act as you wish. For example, devouring the meat you laid down to distract a marauding Moblin – you can eat your fill after the giant, spear chucking pig is vanquished, thank you. Each new echo we acquired during our time with the game left us wondering what new one would surprise us further down the line, especially given the vast variety already at our disposal. </p><p>These quirks and behaviours unique to each echo keep them interesting and bring the world to life as you discover new methods and combinations for achieving your goals. Just as in Tears of the Kingdom you could scale a mountain by building a great structure out of trees, or a rocket fuelled launch pad, Echoes of Wisdom lets you create stairs out of assorted furniture, trampolines on top of trampolines, or a helpful Strandtula to shoot you a rope of web. Combat is less about overwhelming the enemy with brute force and instead deciphering the best natural predator of the target in front of you. Snake-like Ropes can slither between airborne assaults whereas the sharp spines of a Sea Urchin can pierce a Darknut’s armour. Or just brute force it and pelt them with rocks. The possibilities feel endless, and with echoes constantly replenishing their uses you can experiment with all kinds of bizarre setups. I’m sure we’ll be seeing a new wave of nefarious set ups on social media, as Zelda is seen setting her kingdom of furnishings ablaze and gliding to safety on the wings of a Keese.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-020-scrn-1725980180853.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Friendly Ropes can help you overcome any fear of snakes</figcaption></figure></output><p>Whilst echoes are the bread and butter of the game, much like Ultrahand and Fusing were for Tears of the Kingdom, Zelda has a few more abilities in her already expanded arsenal. Bind grants control over the objects you cannot echo, like giant boulders, moving platforms, or unique features of a puzzle. When an object is bound to Zelda, it moves with her, meaning clever positioning when the ability is activated is essential to success. So far we’ve seen it used to remove obstacles, place objects on switches, and to create barriers from unwanted attacks. Given that these objects do not expire like echoes do, combining the powers may help you build higher than before and achieve more creative setups. You can also bind echoes, which is helpful for moving things you don’t want to touch, like flaming shrubs, around. Reverse Bond is, as the name suggests, the opposite of Bind in that it allows objects to move Zelda. Things with their own momentum, such as a moving platform or even a crawling critter, can be reverse bonded to and will travel Zelda with it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-016-scrn-1725980216790.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Reverse Bond is handy for covering great chasms</figcaption></figure></output><p>For those already missing our fabled swordsman, do not fret, as Zelda can also tap into the power of Link’s blade when she needs to by transforming into Swordfighter Form. After fighting an imposter to reclaim Link’s sword, Zelda can enter a glowing blue state and use new powers for a limited time, laying waste to enemies with slashes and spin attacks. This is not a core ability like echoes or bind, and from what we’ve seen is not necessary for solving puzzles or besting bosses, but a nice addition when you need a power boost against a ferocious horde or just want a dramatic climax to a battle. The energy required to enter Swordfighter Form can be found in the still world or by defeating rift enemies but charging the metre is still a slow task, so you’ll want to use it wisely. Similar to how Tears of the Kingdom allowed you to use powerful weapons and devices to creatively circumvent challenges, if you took the time to locate them, Echoes of Wisdom has a few extras and power ups that let you rain destruction should that be your approach. Drinkable smoothies and deployable automatons shown off in trailers are going to grant Zelda healing and buffs or can be unleashed in battle for dramatic effects, respectively. Automatons, robotic replicas of foes with a few added upgrades, can be broken in combat and then need to be repaired, similar to how the durability of weapons and battery-life on builds in Tears of the Kingdom require a little resource management.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-015-scrn-1725980242565.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Who wore it better?</figcaption></figure></output><p>With all of these abilities, a vast catalogue of echoes, and an army of creatures at her command, adventuring and overcoming threats in the world of Hyrule feels fresh and exciting. Traditional locales you’d expect, such as the Gerudo Desert and Eldin Volcano, return but have been made with Zelda’s new powers in mind. There are more vertical elements, terrain hazards, and weather conditions than previous top down titles, instead resembling recent games. The overworld feels more like that Tears of the Kingdom hybrid between a giant puzzle and a sandbox, allowing player creativity and experimentation to shine. Dungeons retain that more focused puzzle solving objective, alongside the new Still World–a dimension that bends the laws of physics with floating islands and areas shifted onto their side. These sections allow for creative platforming which both challenges players and teaches them new tricks to take back into Hyrule.</p><p>Given the leaps in creativity and mechanics the series has made in recent titles, it’s exciting to see the return to the top down style of Zelda embrace this as well as having a playable princess. Echoes of Wisdom takes elements of Tears of the Kingdom and develops them into something fresh which stands on its own two feet. If Tears of the Kingdom is a physics test utilising forces and the laws of gravity and aerodynamics, Echoes of Wisdom is a chemical experiment pushing players to toy with different combinations in a more contained environment. It marries the classic puzzle solving that long time fans of the series adore with the outside-the-box thinking and unexpected chaos of recent games. The result is uniquely Zelda and has us eager to  discover all of the echoes and challenges the game has to offer. Whether you opt for the pillow fort you dreamed of as a child, a genius domino effect of destruction, or the humble fish attack, there’s an adventure waiting just for you.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.</blockquote><blockquote>It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.</blockquote><p>Players were left wondering whether Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit will force Palworld to shut down. As you’d expect, the official Palworld Discord is packed with posts from players debating the likelihood of Nintendo’s success with its lawsuit, and the implication it might have on the game.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pocketpair is continuing to update Palworld regardless. Just a few hours after Nintendo announced the lawsuit, Pocketpair released a hotfix for the Xbox version of Palworld to fix a fatal bug where wild Pals and base Pals would sometimes stop moving and working. The developer said the same issue is happening in the Steam version, and it’s on the case.</p><p>“Thank you for your continued support of Palworld,” Pocketpair <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1836625740445683780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p><p>Replies to this tweet were quick to note the timing of the hotfix. “Please don’t ever shut down the game, ya'll killing it,” said one fan. “Y’all getting sued and posting hotfixes,” said another. “Not even phased,” added one user. “Does bro know they’re getting sued?” joked another.</p><p>After Palworld’s record-breaking launch in January and the subsequent comparisons to Pokémon, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-palworld-blows-up-could-nintendo-successfully-sue-the-controversial-pokemon-with-guns-game">IGN asked experts whether Nintendo could potentially successfully sue Pocketpair</a>. At the time, Peter Lewin, video game lawyer at Wiggin, told IGN much would depend on which country Nintendo pursued legal action in, given the differences in IP laws across the globe. The U.S., for example, has a “notoriously permissive” fair use defense, which might have influenced where Nintendo sued Pocketpair. Nintendo’s lawsuit was filed in the Tokyo District Court.</p><p>Sam Castree, a copyright lawyer and avid Pokémon player, told IGN there was the potential for a court order that would block Pocketpair from selling Palworld, but cast doubt on the likelihood of a lawsuit. That analysis, however, was in the context of a lawsuit based upon copyright infringement. Nintendo’s lawsuit alleges patent infringement, although the company has yet to detail which patents.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Today sees <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> release on PC almost two years after its console launch and it brings a much-requested new option.</p>
<p>Yes, finally players will be able to reduce the frequency of puzzle hints from companions, so talking head Mimir will finally shut up. Check the in-game "Gameplay Settings" tab to enable this feature.</p>
<p>You may remember plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-overly-helpful-characters-create-a-puzzling-puzzle-problem">discourse around the high frequency of puzzle hints in God of War Ragnarök</a>. Essentially, whenever you arrive at a puzzle NPCs will provide hints to its solution before you've barely got your bearings.</p>

<p>Many players found the hints intrusive, but there was no specific way to turn them off. While the accessibility options included a "Puzzle Timing" setting, this was actually for increasing the time limit of certain puzzles. As the game's lead UX designer Mila Pavlin told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-guide/23453949/atreus-mimir-puzzle-solutions-menu-option">Polygon</a> at the time: "Those settings do not impact the banter".</p>
<p>Players took matters into their own hands by turning down the volume of dialogue during puzzle sequences, though this was hardly a suitable solution.</p>
<p>Thankfully Sony Santa Monica has listened to criticism and included the option for PC players, as detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/18/god-of-war-ragnarok-brings-a-host-of-new-features-to-pc-available-tomorrow/">PlayStation Blog</a>. What's more, it'll soon be added for the console version too.</p>
<p>Another addition on PC also coming to console is Cinematic Audio Description. Found in the accessibility options, this will provide contextual information alongside dialogue in cutscenes.</p>
<p>Lastly, for anyone streaming their playthrough of God of War Ragnarök on PC, Sony has provided custom alerts for subscribers, followers and the like.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarök is now available on PC across both Steam and Epic.</p>
<p>"Much like its heroes, God of War: Ragnarök learns to love itself for what it truly is: gargantuan, excessive, and wonderfully absurd," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-glorious-excess-makes-a-triumphant-return">Eurogamer's God of War: Ragnarök review</a> of the original PlayStation release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Starfield beta patch is now live on PC, introducing performance and lighting improvements and much more.</p>
<p>The main addition of the 1.14.68 patch in terms of features is a new Creation Kit feature, an automated process for creating models for distant LOD. The new beta patch also brings quite a bit in terms of improvements and fixes, such as general performance and stability improvements, lighting enhancements throughout the game, visual improvements for weapon models, improved player head tracking when exiting dialogue, and more.</p>
<p>The new Starfield patch also brings some gameplay, quests, locations, ships, vehicle, UI and audio fixes and improvements. You can find the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1716740/view/4676514574278987287?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Starfield is about to receive the Shattered Space expansion, which promises to enhance the experience considerably with new handcrafted locations, a new engaging storyline, improvements to close-range combat, and more. You can check out a deep dive into what the expansion will offer by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-gets-official-deep-dive-video/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about Bethesda's latest game by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.</em></p>

<p>Pocketpair has officially responded to Nintendo’s lawsuit of patent infringement over the highly successful game Palworld.</p>



<div><p>Pocketpair’s <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">response reads</a>,</p><p>“Yesterday, a lawsuit was filed against our company for patent infringement.</p></div>



<p>We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.</p>



<p>At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.</p>



<p>Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.</p>



<p>It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.</p>



<p>We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.</p>



<p>As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.”</p>



<p>Released in January 2024, Palworld sold over 25 million copies and became the second-highest-played game in Steam history before it was knocked into third position by Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> is being developed with the intention of the series "being a story that will be completed".</p>
<p>That's according to series director Tetsuya Nomura, via a new interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://youngjump.jp/yj45_interview/02/">YoungJump</a>.</p>
<p>Nomura was asked if he could foresee an end to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> series, especially considering its multiple sequels and spin-off games.</p>

<p>Nomura replied he only has "a few years left until I retire" so must "decide whether to retire first or finish the series first" (via Google translate). As such, he's developing Kingdom Hearts 4 "with the intention of it being a story that will be completed".</p>
<p>Further, the game will be a reset of the story (it's notoriously complex), with new writers hired and a new logo to make it easier for newcomers to join the series (thanks, Aitai Kimochi).</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Nomura says in an interview with Young Jump that he envisions Kingdom Hearts IV and Missing Link as new titles to the series rather than just sequels. </p><p>After KH3 ended, he wanted to kind of reset the story, so they even hired new writers and changed the logo to make it easier… <a href="https://t.co/h6CKqr8YNz">pic.twitter.com/h6CKqr8YNz</a></p></div>— ☆オードリーAudrey☆ (@aitaikimochi) <a href="https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1836427263614816332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>What's more, the plot will finally resolve Sora's famous line from the first game: "is any of this for real or not?" That will come from Quadratum, described as an "unreality within reality" - Nomura stated this in-game world based on Shibuya has been an idea since the first game.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Nomura discussed development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, for which he was lead character designer.</p>
<p>He explained, for the first time, that Aerith was designed first but with Tifa's personality. However, he decided to avoid convention and have two heroines, taking Aerith's personality and creating Tifa as a separate character. Aerith's new personality was then born from the destiny she must fulfil in the plot.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Nomura mentions, apparently for the first time ever regarding FF7 Aerith and Tifa, that Aerith was actually created first but with the personality of Tifa.</p><p>However, he didn't want to do what had already been done before, so he decided to make two heroines. He then took Aerith's… <a href="https://t.co/9ojLMCUeex">pic.twitter.com/9ojLMCUeex</a></p></div>— ☆オードリーAudrey☆ (@aitaikimochi) <a href="https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1836437207734997350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>Aerith was meant to be a glamorous heroine in contrast to Cloud's dark side and Barret's toughness, resulting in her red clothes and bright hair - although this was tied up as polygons couldn't express its fluttering texture.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Nomura also commented on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">confusing ending of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. <strong>Spoilers follow</strong>.</p>
<p>Part of the aim for the Remake trilogy was to play with the "distortion of perception" based on players' memories of the original game that must have changed slightly in the years since its release.</p>
<p>As such, the scene at the end of the game with Sephiroth and Cloud in white space witnessing multiple visions is meant to capture the multiple distortions of memory - while all visions represent Final Fantasy 7 (including the world of the game in the player's mind), they are all subtly different. This is to represent the blurring of memory and how, through various spin-offs and the passing of time, the original story has become distorted.</p>
<p>In a separate interview last week, Final Fantasy series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-betray-fans-of-the-original-says-series-producer">Yoshinori Kitase promised the final part of the Remake trilogy won't "betray fans of the original"</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear when that final part will be released, though there's certainly a balancing act between fan expectations and providing a satisfying conclusion to its complex multiverse plot.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has responded to this morning's dramatic decision by Nintendo to file a patent infringement lawsuit against the company.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">statement</a> issued via social media and the company's website, Pocketpair said it received notice of the legal proceedings yesterday but was still "unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon". 
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair said it would battle the lawsuit on behalf of Palworld's fans, but also framed the fight as a matchup between "a small indie game company" that wanted "to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursusing their creative ideas".
</p>
<p>
The developer described the situation as "truly unfortunate" - as it would now have to divert resources to fighting the lawsuit - and apologised to supporters for "any worry and discomfort this news has caused".
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair's statement is below in full:
</p>
<p>
"Yesterday, a lawsuit was filed against our company for patent infringement.
</p>
<p>
"We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.
</p>
<p>
"At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.
</p>
<p>
"Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.
</p>
<p>
"It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.
</p>
<p>
"We apologise to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.
</p>
<p>
"As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair."
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced their legal action</a> in the early hours of this morning, via a short statement that revealed the companies were seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages".</p>
<p>Palworld launched in January and was played by 25 million people during its first month on PC and Xbox. Today's news comes ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">widely-expected PS5 version of the game</a> being announced. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Plucky Squire Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-plucky-squire-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-plucky-squire-review.985311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-plucky-squire-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I immediately liked <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-plucky-squire">The Plucky Squire</a>. Not just because it’s utterly charming, beautifully presented, and exactly what you’d hope for from an indie game, but because within the first few moments, it also used my favourite non-expletive exclamation “Cracking!” It sets the tone for an adventure that’s perfectly written, unequivocally British and genuinely funny. And what a cracking game it is too.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Plucky Squire | Launch Trailer | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xREgLxEzZE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sam’s room is a normal child’s bedroom, stuffed with slightly too many things, and probably the wrong side of clutter. On the desk sits The Plucky Squire, a children’s book packed with bright colours and fun-filled characters. The key difference though, is that you can take control of The Plucky Squire, taking him on a Zelda-esque journey through the pages of the book. The edge of each page isn’t where this adventure stops though, and you can move from the 2D surface of the book out into the 3D ‘real’ world beyond, and then onto other 2D surfaces.</p>


<p>Jot is the titular Plucky Squire. He lives in the land of Mojo, a land of creativity, and one which looks and feels very much like the 2D Hyrule of Link’s smaller-scale adventures – and more specifically, the Zelda-inspired <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/21/swords-of-ditto-mormos-curse-switch-review-update/">Swords of Ditto</a>. As you move from 2D screen to 2D screen, the pages of the book turn, lending a sense of place and solidity to this literature-led fictional world.</p>


<p>The Zelda comparisons are never truer than during The Plucky Squire’s combat. Jot swings his sword with Link-like alacrity, battling Goblins, Slimes and charging bulls within minutes of setting out on his quest. He’s just as keen to chop down nearby tufts of grass, too, with the lightbulbs discovered within the currency you’ll use to upgrade your abilities, unlock new skills or add concept art to the in-game gallery. It’s definitely quicker to dispense these than Nintendo have ever been, as long as you’re keen on manicuring every lawn.</p>
<p>There’d be very little reason for the game to be set in a book unless All Possible Futures made the most of it, and they absolutely do, with words crucial to advancing through Jot’s adventure. At first, some pages feature text that further the narrative, but soon enough you’re presented with words that just aren’t right. They’re not right because they’re missing, and you have to search for the replacement words to fill in the gaps, solving this very first word puzzle in order to open a gate that’s blocking your path.</p>
<p>While it starts out straightforward, you’re soon using words to puzzle your way further, swapping them around for different results, or choosing from multiple options. In a nice touch, some of the wrong choices have deeply funny or unexpected results, so it’s worth deliberately getting things wrong, just to see what lies in store for you. After all, who doesn’t want to turn a tiny frog into a huge one?</p>

<p>In all the most positive ways possible, The Plucky Squire feels like a first-party Nintendo game. Shifting between the 2D pages of the book and the 3D world outside it is fundamentally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">a trick we’ve seen Mario perform</a>, but it’s done wonderfully well. Sam’s a creative child, and there are sketches stuck around the real world that Jot can also hop in and out of, and every time you do it just feels smart and ever so playful. If ever a game felt intelligently designed, it’s this one.</p>
<p>As with many puzzlers, there are occasional moments of backtracking, and hopping in and out of the book is sometimes more of a chore than a magical experience, but overall, the team have done a good job of making the mechanic feel integral and imaginative, and it doesn’t outstay it’s welcome through the game’s 7-8 hours of runtime.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire is built on the collaboration between intelligence and charm. It looks utterly gorgeous too, from the art of the picture book, through to the lovingly crafted world of Sam’s room. There’s a vein of classic British children’s properties running through it all, and books/shows like Funnybones and The Trap Door have the same sort of knowing humour that will appeal to adults and children alike. I’ve loved playing through it with my eight-year-old son, particularly as he’s an avid reader, and we’ve shared the same enjoyment of Jot’s ability to swap out words and see the effect.</p>

<p>In fact, if we’re looking for one of the few downsides, it would be that some words don’t have any effect at all when put into certain sentences. While there’s definitely some great moments, it would have been fun to see some further odd results. Other than that, there is a sense of familiarity here, and for all of the astounding vibrancy and playfulness on display, you may have seen some of it before. That Nintendo-feel amalgamates some of their greatest hits, combining elements of Mario and Zelda, but then, if you’re going to crib from someone, why not crib from the best?</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> was one of last year's surprise <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> hits. It was a brilliant dystopian scavenging sim in which you searched cellars for bolts while avoiding the attentions of creatures that hate being looked at, or which only move when they're not being looked at, or which look like your friends, from a distance. The developer's next game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/welcome-to-the-dark-place">Welcome To The Dark Place</a>, is more about hearing. It's an "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a>, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"You are lost in a nightmare playground of ideas," explains the Steam page. "This is an expansive, auditory feast of tragedy and terror. You must find a way out." From the looks of the trailer below, you'll do that partly by selecting text options in the style of a choose-your-own-adventure book. But there's definitely a navigable 3D world in there, made up of heavily pixelated objects.

Unlike, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perception-review">Perception</a>, Welcome To The Dark Place doesn't appear to be a story about a person with a visual impairment. The "playground of ideas" bit sounds like a joke about the infamous "marketplace of ideas". I wonder if this will be in keeping with the whimsy of Lethal Company, whose "entities" are as silly as they are atrocious. That said, the Steam page cautions that "there are underlying themes of suicide and self-harm". Here are some moody snippets from the blurb:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
#1: Three red blots mark liars.
</p>
<p>
#2: Food means depravity and death.
</p>
<p>
#3: No one leaves the forest where trees align.
</p>
<p>
#4: Don't listen to the wolf.
</p>
<p>
#5: Holes in suspicious places may lead to the Undergoing.
</p>
<p>
#6: Tellers of time... 
</p>
<p>
[The corner of the note is torn off.] 
</p></blockquote>
<p>All words to live by, I'm sure! Probably not for very long.</p>
<p>
Welcome To The Dark Place was announced back in 2019, though it's news to me. I'm interested to know how the success Zeekerss has found with Lethal Company may have altered its direction. Anyway, you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135700/Welcome_To_The_Dark_Place/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://zeekerss.itch.io/welcometothedarkplace">Itch</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A comment on a Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 video appearing to be from Saber CEO Matthew Karch has raised eyebrows for stating that games should be about "glory kills" instead of "imposing morals on gamers".</p>
<p>The comment, from an account named "MatthewKarch" purporting to be the Saber CEO, was made on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBUqCUZ0swE">video by streamer Asmongold</a> titled "Space Marine 2 is a reminder of what we lost".</p>
<p>The video is a response to another from YouTuber Legendary Drops who described the recently released Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 as oozing "with so much masculinity that I feel like I've been in a desert for the last few years". Asmongold vehemently agrees in his almost one hour response.</p>

</figure>
<p>The comment from the "MatthewKarch" account mentions they love Asmongold's videos, before providing further details on the developer's intentions with Space Marine 2.</p>
<p>"I love your videos," the account wrote. "When we signed the deal to make Space Marine 2, all I wanted was a throwback game. We had the chance to work on something which by its nature was 'old school'. I can't even comprehend many of the current games that we play these days. They are too complex and too much of an investment. We worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> back in the day, and that game could be distilled down to the simplest of shooting loops, but it was entirely addicting.</p>
<p>"That is what we wanted to recapture. I hope that games like Space Marine 2 and Wukong are the start of a reversion to a time when games were simply about fun and immersion. I spent some time as Chief Operating Officer at Embracer and I saw games there that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers.</p>
<p>"We just want to do some glory kills and get the heart rate up a little.  For me that is what games should be about."</p>
<p>Another account, purporting to be creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick, also commented on Asmongold's video: "Hearing everything you have to say about the story and characters resonates so strongly with our actual approach. It's great to hear you calling out the exact things that we intentionally focused on. It was four and a half years of intense work and passion and watching videos like this makes it all worth it."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Saber to verify the legitimacy of these accounts, but a company representative said it was "not commenting on this matter". Eurogamer also contacted Karch directly, but has not heard a response.</p>
<p>Five days after posting, the comments are still live on the video, with MatthewKarch's comment receiving 15,000 upvotes and hundreds of replies praising his work. "This is what we, the gamers, the audience, not the non existent 'modern audience' want," reads one.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2 has certainly received praise since its release last week. Our Eurogamer review applauded the game's "grisly" combat, but criticised its characterisation. "Saber clearly wants you to think of its characters as more than metal-plated meatheads, and I enjoyed how the campaign hints at the character's emotions by their very attempts to avoid showing them," it reads. "Sadly, it never delves much further than this, and the campaign drifts increasingly toward tropes and fan-service as it proceeds. It's still entertaining, but doesn't transcend itself in the way it suggests it might in the first half."</p>
<p>However, Asmongold and Legendary Drops praise the game for its overt masculine themes and for - at last! - targeting a game towards a straight male audience.</p>
<p>Karch's comments about imposing morals have raised eyebrows, particularly in the wake of criticism surrounding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> considering the anti-woke sentiment around that game following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">reports of misogyny at the studio</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-studio-requests-influencers-not-include-feminist-propaganda-or-covid-19-references-in-coverage">leaked document to streamers</a> requesting not to include "politics" or "feminist propaganda" in their coverage.</p>
<p>Space Marine 2 is the first release from Saber <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">following its split from Embracer</a>, which sold its assets for $247m in a move to withdraw from Russia and "reduce [its] geopolitical risk".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that they, alongside The Pokémon Company, are suing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair.</p>
<p>Citing patent infringement, the lawsuit is seeking an injunction and compensation for damages.</p>


<p>The lawsuit is coming around nine months after Palworld launched into Early Access at the start of 2024, become an instant smash hit thanks, in part, to the popular perception that it’s basically “Pokémon with guns”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">Nintendo’s statement reads</a>:</p>
<p><em>Nintendo Co., Ltd. (HQ: Kyoto, Minami-ku, Japan; Representative Director and President: Shuntaro Furukawa, “Nintendo” hereafter), together with The Pokémon Company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court against Pocketpair, Inc. (HQ: 2-10-2 Higashigotanda, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, “Defendant” hereafter) on September 18, 2024.</em></p>

<p><em>This lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights.</em></p>
<p><em>Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years.</em></p>
<p>They’re coming for Palworld and all it’s got, in other words.</p>

<p>It’s without a doubt that Palworld features a menagerie of rather derivative creature designs, with comparisons of 3D models by the gaming community bringing up the theory that Pocketpair had used Game Freak’s assets as base models and tweaked them. As a game experience, though, Palworld has a lot of rather different game mechanics in it alongside creature battling and capturing.</p>
<p>Back in January, all this speculation <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/the-pokemon-company-issues-a-statement-about-palworld/">pushed The Pokémon Company to issue a statement</a> that said, “We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.”</p>
<p>What’s particularly interesting is that they’re not going for copyright infringement, which would have suggested they thought Palworld copied Pokémon designs, but rather for infringing patents that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company hold. These would delve deep into the specific mechanics of Palworld, which game patents can cover, while an overarching genre cannot – similarly, there used to be a patent for including minigames in loading screens, and Warner Bros. holds a patent over the Nemesis System featured in the Shadows of Mordor game, preventing other developers from having a similar dynamic boss structure in their games.</p>
<p>As court documents start to emerge it will be fascinating to see what Nintendo’s lawyers pin Pocketpair with. Could it be Pal Spheres and capturing creatures a bit too similarly to Pokéballs?</p>

            <p>
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the Palwoods and hunt large, electric yellow animals of entirely original design whose names rhyme with "peekaboo", Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have announced that they're taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair to court for "infringement of patent rights". 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"This lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights," reads <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">a terse statement</a> published last night.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years," it adds.
</p>
<p>
The statement doesn't specify which of Nintendo's intellectual property rights Palworld has allegedly infringed.
</p>
<p>
Palworld, in case you're still catching up, is a monster-catching <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game with monsters that are maybe just possibly a teeny bit like Pokémon. There was some discussion of this earlier in the year, when Palworld <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-continues-to-break-records-with-18-million-concurrent-players-on-steam">set Steam records at launch</a> - some Pokédefenders were convinced that Pocketpair had actually broken intellectual property law. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">We interviewed a lawyer about it ourselves</a> - he told us that, on the whole, Pals and Pokémon are "sufficiently different that there's no problem". Nintendo evidently disagree. 
</p>
<p>
There were warning signs that Nintendo - who are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-still-owes-millions">a lot more protective of their intellectual property</a> than their cherubic branding suggests - would take action back in January. "We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game," they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pokemon-company-statement-on-palworld-copyright-allegations-sounds-a-lot-like-please-leave-us-the-hell-alone">wrote in a comment at the time</a>. "We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon. We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future." 
</p>
<p>
Back in January, I interpreted that partly as a weary acknowledgement to Pokémon fans that, yes, they were aware of Palworld's existence. In hindsight, I think I underestimated Nintendo's litigiousness. The question I have is: if Nintendo wins this lawsuit, what does that bode for other artistic works that take inspiration from Pokémon? Palworld might be a bit of a rip-off, but it's a very different game moment to moment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-early-access-review">somewhat to its cost</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Update 19th September 2024</strong>: Pocketpair have <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">responded to Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, stating that they are beginning "the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement" and that "at this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details".</p>
<p>They add: "It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review.985278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Shambling out of the seventh-generation graveyard for its <em>second</em> remaster, Capcom at least deserves credit for bringing Dead Rising itself in line with accepted zombie lore. That is, it too is now officially a stubborn corpse that refuses to stay dead. However, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster earns credit for more than just that. Capcom has injected a series of smart tweaks to the gameplay that make surviving a zombie-infested mall less frustrating than it was 20 years ago, but it does so while still preserving the feel of the original’s challenging, time-limited experience. Combined with a fresh visual overhaul, the result is easily the best way to play what’s still the best Dead Rising game – even if the occasionally creaky combat is certainly showing its age through a modern lens.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Remasters and remakes of already strong video games can be a little hard to appraise. They can be fantastic yet inescapably inessential, like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review">The Last of Us Part 1</a> – a remake of an existing, excellent remaster that was already hard to fault on a console just a single generation old. Alternatively, they can be literally nothing more than a small resolution bump, like the 2019 remaster of 2009’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/12/ghostbusters-the-video-game-remastered-review">Ghostbusters: The Video Game</a>. I adore Ghostbusters but, aside from saving it from being marooned on PS3 on Sony’s side of the fence, what did re-publishing it as a bespoke product achieve that the ‘Enhanced’ 4K updates delivered to dozens of Xbox 360 games for free did not? </p><p>In fairness, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster makes a far clearer case for itself, because it isn’t <em>just</em> slightly better looking. Crucially, it’s also a better game to <em>play</em>.</p><h2>Kill ’em Mall</h2><p>For clarity, this is not a ground-up do-over in the same spirit as its undead Capcom cousins, though it is driven by the same RE Engine that powers all recent Resident Evil remakes. Cutscenes and conversations are all running on the same rigging, and it does largely feel like the 2006 classic is chugging away under the glossy surface most of the time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It is a vast visual improvement, but that’s hardly a shocking revelation considering the 18-year-old source material. The increase in fidelity boosts the facial animations to a level that was virtually non-existent before. I don’t really have a position on Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster’s older and wearier Frank West. More dad bod, less heartthrob; it makes no meaningful difference to me. I am jealous of his shoulders, though, which seem slightly more immense this time around. Seriously, the bloke is built like a 4:3 man in a world of widescreen.</p><p>At any rate, it’s the world of Willamette Parkview Mall that remains the real star here. Exploring the detailed stores, each with their distinct themes and ranges of weaponisable products, was deeply nostalgic – doubly so considering how much I desperately miss CD and DVD shops, and Willamette has four of ’em.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s the world of Willamette Parkview Mall that remains the real star here.</p></div><p>It’s not without defects, though. Pop-in is particularly prevalent in the outdoor Leisure Park area, which is disappointing. There are also occasional textures that are consistently late to sharpen up, and some literal signs of AI-upscaled nonsense (on a door plaque that’s overtly closed in our faces during an early cutscene, no less) do make me wonder about how many human eyeballs passed over these assets on their way into the finished product.</p><p>However, the more important tweaks in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster concern how it feels rather than how it looks. While the original control scheme is still included, I warmed to the new controls instantly. I certainly couldn’t go back now.</p><p>The ability to move while aiming is a sizeable shift. Even though it makes cheesing some of the dopier bosses a lot easier, it's a big part of what makes the new controls feel far less clunky. Special moves have been shifted to button presses rather than requiring expert manipulation of the right stick. On the flip side, answering radio calls and issuing commands to the survivors you have in tow has been moved <em>to</em> analogue stick presses, meaning we can continue moving in any direction without being interrupted. I found I could jog, carve a path through zombies, <em>and</em> bark commands at the moronic mallrats I’d mustered together without skipping a beat. It also helps that survivors are noticeably smarter than they were in the original. They’re not completely immune from pathfinding problems, and things begin to look quite janky when herding large groups, but it’s a tidy improvement overall.</p><p>Weapon durability is now illustrated, and navigation is also improved markedly. The original’s nebulous arrow has been replaced with a working compass and distance indicators, which help distinguish when objective locations are on different floors and make it clearer when fresh objectives are close by. It makes it a lot easier to see whether a newly noticed survivor is worth diverting for on, say, your current trip back to the security room. Combined with the new auto-save mechanic, it’s a real timesaver. I’ve picked up far larger groups of survivors in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster than I ever dared to back in 2006.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The constant loading times between areas are admittedly a bit draining in 2024, but the auto-saves that trigger upon passing between them are a game changer. Yes, it’s true a certain degree of frustration is part of the original Dead Rising’s DNA. It asked players to make difficult and timely decisions, settle on sometimes-unfortunate compromises, and improvise when things went wrong. That said, I think the new auto-save system is a fair and modern middle ground. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster <em>is</em> easier because of it, but it does remain a rigidly time-sensitive experience that demands a considerable amount of plate spinning. If you do want to schlep all the way back from a save point as a matter of principle, there are now 20 save slots and you’re certainly free to play it that way. Personally, I’m okay with the challenge <em>without</em> the tedium.</p><h2>Wrecking Mall</h2><p>In contrast, there are some changes that don’t work, including portions of the re-recorded voice acting. It’s good that all the survivor and radio dialogue is fully voiced now (although there are times where the survivor chatter sounds like a completely different person than you initially spoke to). However, some of the replacement performances for central characters are a little more stilted, which only tends to highlight the awkwardness of the script’s clumsiest lines.</p><p>Speaking of the script, there are also some slightly baffling changes in that regard, too – but none more so than the scrubbing of Cliff’s history as a Vietnam War veteran. To refresh, Cliff is the “psychopath” found in Crislip's Home Saloon who’s suffered a complete break from reality; the horrors of the zombie outbreak have sent him directly back to the war. If there was a genuine concern here regarding trivialising PTSD amongst combat veterans, I’d get it, but Cliff is still overtly a military man. It just comes across like someone didn’t want Cliff to call Frank a “filthy communist.” That’s pretty inane censorship in a game that saw fit to leave, say, its hugely horny hostage-taking cop otherwise intact.</p><p>Of course, it’s hardly game breaking, but it’s a shame something so small has been prioritised over things that would’ve made Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster genuinely better. For instance, the prisoner psychopaths in the Humvee <em>still</em> respawn after a few hours. That <em>always</em> felt like a mistake (or, at a minimum, a cheap trick to pull on players) and it doesn’t make any sense. No other unique psychopaths respawn like that.</p><p>The elevator to the roof is eventually always still full of zombies. That was dumb then, and it’s still dumb. Having it filled with zombies <em>occasionally</em> would be a shock. As it is, it’s just tiresome, especially when all you need to do is dart in and spam interact to trigger the elevator anyway. As long as your survivors were close enough to the lift to begin with, you’ll all still appear safe on the empty roof regardless of how many zombies were in the lift. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster could’ve massaged <em>that</em>.</p><p>Then again, maybe it couldn’t have. Maybe some of that jank is too deeply baked into the original gameplay to be removed without breaking something else. I also guess it isn’t the only stuff that comes across as a little shonky by contemporary standards. We are talking about a game where you need to shoot a woman in the face with a sniper rifle until she calms down, or fill a man’s body with bullets until he runs away healthy, leaving your ally totally crippled with the one shot in the entire shootout that seemed to matter. Hey, it’s old. It’s how we used to do things.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>This morning, at Barcelona's Unite 2024, GTFO developer 10 Chambers showed off a <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-6-showcased-in-new-fantasy-kingdom-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity 6</a> tech demo of its upcoming game, Den of Wolves. <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> at The Game Awards 2023, Den of Wolves marks a return to their roots for the studio founded by former PAYDAY leads.</p>
<p>It's a cooperative heist game set in a near-future hyper-capitalistic island called Midway City. Players will operate as criminals for hire in the conflict between rival corporations. The studio started developing the game in 2021.</p>
<p>10 Chambers Co-Founder and Chief Development Officer Hjalmar Vikström said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At 10 Chambers, we tend to build many tools ourselves, but when the team at Unity built us a scene in Unity 6 with Den of Wolves assets, we were convinced and started upgrading the game to it. It looks better, but it also lets us iterate quickly and freely, which helps when experimenting with many different gameplay ideas. Something especially valuable for a game like Den of Wolves where we’re trying to elevate what a heist game can be.</em></p>
<p>Robin Björkell, Communications Director at 10 Chambers, added:</p>
<p><em>Revealing the look and feel of a game level at a developer conference isn’t the typical marketing approach, but as developers first, it felt natural. Svante showcased Den of Wolves' real-time environment in Unity 6, and while it looks promising, there's still work ahead before it's ready for players. We're taking our time to avoid disappointment, but expect to see gameplay in the not so distant future.</em></p>

<p>Den of Wolves can be wishlisted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818140/Den_of_Wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and will eventually debut in Early Access, although there's no set release window yet. GTFO was only ever released on PC, although that doesn't necessarily mean consoles will be excluded from this new game after it launches out of early access.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Miles Ross Released by Activision As Microsoft Layoffs Hit the Call of Duty League]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/miles-ross-release-activision-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/miles-ross-released-by-activision-as-microsoft-layoffs-hit-the-call-of-duty-league.985263/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/miles-ross-release-activision-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Miles ‘MilesTheRoss’ Ross has been let go from Activision amid an ongoing wave of layoffs at Microsoft. He confirmed that he’s one of several people dismissed from the Call of Duty League team, but it’s unclear how many employees have been impacted yet.</p>



<p>For years, Miles Ross provided impeccable commentary talents to the Call of Duty League’s broadcasts and he had worked hard to become one of the most recognisable presences in the COD esports scene. As an award-winning caster, he has enjoyed many seasons in the spotlight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-certainly-sucks">‘This Certainly Sucks’</h2>



<p>This news went hand-in-hand with a post <a href="https://x.com/MilesTheRoss/status/1836501828613345368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media from Ross</a>, who refrained from any ill repute towards Activision or Microsoft:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week I was let go from ATVI during the latest wave of Microsoft layoffs alongside some brilliant friends in the CDL team. </p>



<p>While this certainly sucks I am still extremely excited for the BO6 season, and even more amped for what the future holds. </p>



<p>For now, my exclusivity with Call of Duty has ended, so bang my line and let’s kick some ass together. </p>



<p>Daddy needs that diaper money.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s around this time every year that the Call of Duty League’s ‘rostermania’ window opens up, with teams chopping and changing across the board. However, the concept of production staff and members of the broadcast team also being cut and dropped during this window is becoming an increasingly common trend.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first round of layoffs to hit the Call of Duty League, unfortunately. It never fails to throw into question the security of the League’s future in the esports space.</p>



<p>For now, teams are continuing to act like nothing is wrong, so perhaps there’s not all that much going on behind the scenes to threaten the Call of Duty League’s 2025 season. It was a only few months back that the CDL’s leadership team made several shocking changes for the betterment of the teams involved in the League, after all.</p>



<p>It’s a monumental shame that we have to bid farewell to Miles Ross, though – his commentary skills were nothing short of transformative.</p>

Because games are often held together by shoestring and fairy dust, updating to the newest version of Unity or Unreal Engine to access new features and stability can be majorly disruptive to your workflow, your code, and your game's performance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a process developers have adapted to, with many only updating their tools every few years during downtime in development—some waiting as long as two years to commit to major engine upgrades.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity wants to change that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the upcoming version of the engine, called Unity 6, the company is changing how it releases updates to developers. According to vice president of product Ryan Ellis, not only will Unity slow down its "major" releases for the engine—with Unity 6 being the major version that will persist through 2025—but it's creating a new update system that will let developers adopt new features and performance improvements on a faster basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a conversation with Game Developer, Ellis said this move is part of its effort to better connect with customers—seemingly another example of how Unity is "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-matt-bromberg-says-runtime-fee-reversal-is-part-of-bid-to-become-a-fundamentally-different-company-">becoming a different company</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity &quot;updates&quot; will roll out alongside the familiar &quot;patches&quot;">Unity "updates" will roll out alongside the familiar "patches"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity's new system will work like this. Instead of annual releases, the new "generational" version of Unity will progress through a series of formalized "updates." ("Imagine that," Ellis said, in reference to the simplicity of the name.)</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-matt-bromberg-says-runtime-fee-reversal-is-part-of-bid-to-become-a-fundamentally-different-company-" target="_self">Unity CEO Matt Bromberg says Runtime Fee reversal is part of bid to become 'a fundamentally different company'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starting with Unity 6.1, which will land in April 2025, developers will gain access to support for foldable devices and "larger screen" formats, Deferred+ rendering in GPU Resident Drawer, and new build targets and build profiles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've been doing patch releases on a biweekly basis for a long, long time," Ellis said, noting that these were meant to be highly stable bits of software providing minor fixes but no new features. Developers who adopted these patches, but didn't advance to the next yearly version of Unity, often missed out on major bug fixes and features that could help their game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This will give us a new mechanism that allows us to drop essentially a minor release...that also has the same stability that they've come to expect," Ellis explained. He said Unity is still determining the cadence of these releases, with multiple updates coming in 2025 in lieu of the next version of Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system won't be perfect right off the bat—developers on long-running games that rely on a specific version of Unity probably won't be making the jump. But Ellis said the idea seems to be resonating with the adoption of Unity 6 preview being "higher" than any of the company's previous releases.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity 6's updates should improve stability for games and game development">Unity 6's updates should improve stability for games and game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity 6 will contain a number of new features the company is eager to promote, but its messaging about the generational update is laden with references to improved stability and quality of life for developers. Some will be visible to players, such as improved graphics rendering like the GPU resident drawer and GPU occlusion culling. "These things allow us to move things that were normally CPU-bound over to the GPU, which is really helping many developers in [Unity 6 preview] speed up their frame rates," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the back end, Ellis said the company has seen "15 percent fewer crashes" in Unity 6 preview, hopefully lowering the number of times developers will need to restart Unity on a daily basis. The company also wants to improve iteration time in the editor. "One of the ways we're doing that is moving from using Mono to CoreCLR in the .net stack—that has some big improvements both in terms of the editor...as well as on runtime," he said. "Another one is that we're moving the content pipeline into an asynchronous process where some import tasks will essentially move into the background."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So instead of developers having to wait synchronously for things in the content pipeline to load, they will be able to have them load in the background while they continue working.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers should hopefully have more frequent access to Unity engineers">Developers should hopefully have more frequent access to Unity engineers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the picture that CEO Matt Bromberg painted for us last week was the idea of Unity getting itself back to a stage where developers could easily get help from the company in almost the same way they would with an in-studio tools expert. Ellis offered more specifics on the topic, saying the company is making changes to its communication process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As Unity 6 is going out the door, we're really trying to ramp up our internal support, and that will mean things like having our teams be much more engaged," he said, noting that many are already regularly interacting with developers, but often through informal processes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Formalizing opportunities to connect with support and engineers at Unity means developers should see more company representatives present in the company's discussion forums and Discord server. He pivoted to pitching the Unite events as another great chance for developers to connect with company experts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity still has a long way to go to earn back trust from developers burned by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-killing-its-controversial-runtime-fee">Runtime Fee saga</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it's fascinating to see how its commitment to changes is manifesting not just in marketing language, but in shifts to its production process.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
