            <p>
You would think that being able to take on 14 different jobs would be enough to keep most people busy in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, but to Level-5 it seems like that won't be enough. Last month, the developer announced that because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has done so well, they'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/level-5-are-so-pleased-with-how-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-is-doing-theyre-giving-away-a-free-bit-of-dlc">releasing a free update/ bit of DLC called Update the World</a>, and they've now offered a couple of details as to what that'll be.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Apparently, it'll be a "roguelike open world" mode, which mostly just sounds like a bit of an awkward translation, but the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">post</a> detailing the mode did explain it a touch at least: "The update will feature an evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements that offers engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." So, kind of what it says on the tin honestly. No details were shared as to how the mode will work, but there will be some new gear, equipment, mounts, hairstyles, emotes, and "unusual items".
</p>
<p>
A bit of character art featuring an evil, wizardy looking big dog creature with a mysterious set of cases attached to their back was also shown off. This new character will arrive with the update, and "plays a pivotal role in the story and is set to leave a significant mark on the world." Kind of love Level-5 just dropping a PNG of some guy almost completely contextlessly.
</p>
<p>
The team is apparently "actively working" on all this new stuff, but there's no release date in sight for it just yet. Considering how big that game is though, I'm sure you've got more than enough to be getting on with in the meantime.

NielsenIQ reports Cyberpunk 2077 has been the best-selling third-party game on Switch 2 so far, while Circana's data reveals Sega is the third-biggest Switch 2 game publisher.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Every Switch 2 Launch Game</p>
      </div>
<p>Circana executive director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Bluesky</a> that "Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%," which is almost double what third-party games did at the launch of the Switch 1. The Game Business did point out that improvement over the performance of third-party games on the original Switch, but also explains that "it's hard to describe these statistics as positive." That's understandable, considering the Switch 2 has had one of the most successful console launches of all time, yet an anonymous publisher is claiming that even its lowest estimates overestimated how well third-party games would do on Switch 2.</p><p>The release of this information has caused discussions over the negative impact of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">Game-Key Cards</a>, which are physical game cartridges that don't contain a game's full data and still require a download. Kelsey Lewin, owner of Seattle game retailer Pink Gorilla Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kelslewin.bsky.social/post/3lrxrv3h7h222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Bluesky</a> that Game-Key Card sales have flagged. "We had very low expectations carrying these in-store but can anecdotally confirm: no one is buying these," Lewin wrote</p><p>Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad is less bullish on the idea that Game-Key Cards had a negative impact on third-party Switch 2 sales. "I hate to break it to people, but the 'I refuse to buy a game for my Nintendo Switch 2 if the physical version is not on the cart' crowd are both a minority today and will be an even smaller minority in five years," he <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1935721809657127138" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>.</p><p>While the third-party numbers on Switch 2 aren't very promising thus far, we'll see how these games perform in the coming months and years as more brand-new games come to the platform.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">got off to a flying start</a>, with Nintendo proudly trumpeting the console as its "fastest-selling hardware ever" just days after launch. But while things are looking rosy for Nintendo, a new report suggests third-party titles have so far struggled, with one third-party publisher saying sales have been "below our lowest estimates".
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">according to TheGameBusiness' Chris Dring</a>, who collated some pertinent sales figures surrounding Switch 2's launch in his latest newsletter. The key numbers are that 48 percent of physical game sales in the UK (and 62 percent of physical game sales in the US) were first-party titles, if Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle is excluded; but if it's <em>not</em>, 86 percent of Switch 2 physical game sales in the UK were for first-party titles. Nintendo, for context, had three titles available physically at launch: Mario Kart World, plus Switch 2 editions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>; third-parties released a total of 13 physical games.
</p>
<p>
Dring notes Switch 2's figures are an improvement compared to the original Switch's launch, where 89 percent of UK physical sales were from first-party games, but adds that "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers", despite the availability of some big names, including Civilization 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, Street Fighter, and Hogwarts Legacy (the report's source, NielsenIQ, does not publicly release video game sales data).

<p>
Speaking to TheGameBusiness, one unnamed third-party publisher painted a bleak picture of its Switch 2 launch sales, saying they'd been "below our lowest estimates". However, not every third-party release has struggled. Dring says CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 was the "best-selling third-party game during the launch of Switch 2", and did "reasonable numbers".
</p>
<p>
Dring highlights the fact CD Projekt was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">one of the few publishers not to opt for Nintendo's controversial Game Key Cards</a>, which require full downloads to play, and quotes CD Projekt's Jan Rosner as having previously said, "Do not underestimate the physical edition. It's not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right."
</p>
<p>
As to <em>why</em> most third-parties have got off to a slow start on Switch 2, Dring suggests a number of reasons in his analysis; there's the console's enhanced backward compatibility, for starters, meaning many players (we've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-scarlet-violet-pokemon-love">some of them here</a>) are likely also delving into the original Switch's impressive back catalogue right now. That's alongside a lack of reviews covering third-party games given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">Nintendo's decision not to provide early consoles to press</a>, and it's hard to ignore the fact almost all third-party Switch 2 titles are ports of older games, which many core players have likely already experienced elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Despite all this, Dring says many major publishers have told him Nintendo is "actively trying to push third-party games this time around", so the hope will obviously be that sales pick up once players have had their fill of Mario Kart World. Notable confirmed third-party titles still to release include EA Sports Madden 26 and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, while Nintendo's big hitters include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-musical-twist-revealed-plus-dk-rap-is-included">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, plus Switch 2 editions of Super Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

            <p>
Match-3 games are probably the purest out there, at least in terms of genre. They are so instantly understandable by pretty much anyone, no wonder there's a seemingly infinite number of them available on our phones. The issue is that most of them can't match up to the heights of a classic like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bejeweled">Bejeweled</a>, though at least every once in a while we get delightful spins on the genre like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spirit-swap">Spirit Swap</a>. Now, there's a new, quite tiny new kid on the block in the form of Sinister Sodies, a match-3 game where you set out to "purify your carbonated concoction before time runs out."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Sinister Sodies has the usual thing you'll find in a match-3 game, i.e. different coloured tiles you have to match up. The particular spin here is that rather than like in other games in the genre where you might move a tile to get a match, you have to box specific combinations of three tiles in by drawing a four-cornered box.
</p>

</span></p><p>
It sounds simple enough, but there's a fast-paced time limit, so in the first instance you have to find a spot that includes your three target tiles before you can even match them up. This gets complicated by things like tiles that explode if you draw a line through them, more and more of said tiles appearing as you make matches. 
</p>
<p>
I really like this little twist on the genre, there's a snappiness to it thanks to the timer that really helps it to feel satisfying when you just manage to make a match. Not enough to make you want to play it for hours on end, but I can see myself coming back to this for five minutes pop when I need a break from writing about the latest Fortnite update or whatever it is games journalists do these days.
</p>
<p>
I think the thing I'm most fond of is the presentation. It all looks like a piece of claymation, rendered in artist Crisppyboat's own signature style. I feel like it's a game that would have fit very well on Cartoon Network's Flash games site back when that was still a thing. Real "killing time on the family computer while your mum is getting ready for the school run" kind of vibe in the most positive of ways possible.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3752580/Sinister_Sodies/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://goblin-laundromat.itch.io/sinister-sodies">itch.io</a>, and it's cheap as chips, so you've not got much of an excuse to not get it honestly.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/powerwash-simulator-2-gets-a-funky-new-gameplay-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Futurlab has shared a new gameplay trailer for their spick-and-span sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in late 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2: Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rLMus-sx1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer showed off a bunch of the tools you’re using to tidy up Muckingham, from your standard powerwasher to a buffing thingy, new elevated platforms, isolated powerwashing jobs for pianos and rugs, and plenty more. It ended off with the new cat companion, Ulysses, who you can pet and take with you on every job. Cute!</p>
<p>But there’s more! PowerWash Simulator 2 will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham.</p>
<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Ganondorf face collage" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103f98688c570/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ganondorf-face-collage.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>You know what would make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> much easier? A herd of Epona. In terms of making it harder? How about multiple Ganondorfs? Well, you can have all that and more thanks to an exploit discovered by the TOTK community. (Thanks <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/feature/what-happens-if-you-send-glitched-items-to-zelda-notes/">GamingReinvented</a>!).</p>
<p>With the new Zelda Notes companion app (compatible only with the Switch 2 Edition), it's possible to share Autobuild creations by uploading them to the app in-game, which then creates a QR code that you can share online. When someone scans that code in and uploads it to the game, voila, they have your Autobuild creation ready to roll.</p>
<p>Those with modded save files have been taking advantage of this feature in hilarious ways, uploading QR codes for "creations" that range from food, bubbles, items locked to shrines, and, uh, Ganondorf. Complete with a health bar and ready to absolutely destroy Link. He'll follow him absolutely everywhere, too, unless you fast travel away.</p>
<p>For something a little more relaxing than being chased by Demon King Ganondorf, there are codes that allow you to summon multiple Epona too — all of this demonstrated over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/1ledk4e/totk_autobuild_sharing_is_so_broken/#lightbox">tearsofthekingdom subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>How is this possible, though? It requires modded save data and access to a modded Switch 1 with TOTK, before transferring the save data to Switch 2. But, essentially, in the save data, you can change any part of an Autobuild to any kind of 'actor' or item.</p>
<p>So, as long as you find a QR code that lets you summon the respective item or character you want (we won't share them here, though they're relatively easy to hunt down), then you can go ahead and cause a different kind of chaos in Hyrule.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering; yes, you can summon an army of good boys, too.</p>

Despite selling out instantly via Wizards of the Coast, these limited-edition mini-sets (Game Over, Weapons, and Grimoire) are still available through third-party platforms like TCGPlayer, though you’ll be paying premium prices well above the original $30–$40 MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each set features beautifully reimagined cards themed around iconic Final Fantasy characters and spells: the Weapons drop highlights legendary arms like Cloud’s Buster Sword and Tidus’s Brotherhood, Grimoire centers on magic-wielders like Vivi and Aerith, and Game Over pays tribute to villains with cards like Spira’s Punishment and Meteorfall. All sets come in standard and foil variants, with Japanese versions available as well. If you’re considering adding these to your collection, be sure to check listings carefully and be prepared for markups ranging from $70 to $150 or more.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Final Fantasy Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's insane how quickly these cards have climbed in value just days after release, and I can guarantee you (almost) that they won't be coming down any time soon. If you fancy saving some money ripping packs of MTG FF, just buy the card you want on TCGPlayer instead and save a fortune.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.
</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark.

Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In Packs RIGHT NOW</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're not talking about vintage or out of print sets, all of these are incredible chase cards you can pull from booster packs available now. You can probably put money on their value going up as soon as their respective sets go out of print. If you don't want to spend mega money ripping open packs, market values on these single cards are quite reasonable for the most part..</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Sealed Stock</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wew're look to market values for Destined Rivals at the moment, seeing as big box stores are either fresh out of stock or charging over MSRP and what they're worth on the secondary market.

<p>Sub-layers of new info</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're all still hyped full of bananergy after yesterday's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025">Direct</a> and, if you're anything like us, you'll likely have been straight onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/">official Nintendo website</a> to check out further details. Standard practice.</p>
<p>However, as we've found over the past 24 hours or so, jumping onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html?m=stage">Japanese version of the site</a> reveals a Donkey Kong Bananza section that has a bunch more details than we've got so far in the US/UK. Indeed, our man Zion has been breaking down the Direct, whilst also digging into new deets he's uncovered on said Japanese site, and well, there's lots juicy stuff to pick at here.</p>
<p>You can check out Zion's video for yourself up top for a much more detailed round-up of everything, but of particular interest here is that he's been looking at the sub-layers (that is, the levels that make up the world that you dig down through in the game) and attempting to piece them all together using both the Direct trailer and the extra details found tucked away on Nintendo's Japanese site.</p>


<p>By doing so, he's attempted to order the nine levels he believes are included, as they'll appear in the game, even digging into some of the minigames and deducing where they may show up.</p>
<p>The levels Zion's managed to work out thus far <em>seem</em> to appear in the game in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingot Isle</li>
<li>Lagoon Layer</li>
<li>Hilltop Layer</li>
<li>Canyon Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Ice &amp; Lava'</li>
<li>Forest Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Beach'</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there's info still missing here, including two missing areas and some names that are placeholders. It certainly gives us a much easier-to-grasp overview of how this one may flow, and an early idea of just how much variety there's gonna be in this one when it drops in just a few weeks' time.</p>
<p>Other juicy details that Zion has picked out in this breakdown include some returning tracks from DK games of the past, as well as a whole bunch of other stuff that, we'll be honest, we'd never have noticed without him!</p>
<p>It's fascinating — and very exciting — stuff for anyone who's been waiting years for a new DK game. Bananza really is beginning to look like a surprisingly inventive banger, and the full breakdown gives lots of details on each area too, so go check it out!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendos-first-party-games-are-dominating-game-sales-on-nintendo-switch-2-while-third-party-published-games-are-off-to-a-slow-start/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is off to an incredible start, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">3.5 million units globally</a> in just its first four days on the market.</p>
<p>Nintendo is selling as many Switch 2 units as it can make, but the massive hardware launch doesn't seem to translate to huge game sales, at least for non-Nintendo games. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">The Game Business</a> reports that in the US, 62% of physical game sales for the Nintendo Switch 2 were for first-party Nintendo games, not including Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In the UK, once again without including Mario Kart World, 48% of physical game sales were first-party Nintendo games, and with Mario Kart World included in those sales, that number bumps up to 86% of physical game sales going to first-party, Nintendo-made titles. Though you might think this leaves out a big piece of the picture by only focusing on physical sales, in cases where games were available digitally and physically, "<em>over 80% of Switch 2 game sales came from physical retailers,</em>" according to data shared by publishers to The Game Business.</p>
<p>A third-party publisher also told The Game Business that their sales numbers were "<em>below our lowest estimates</em>" for what they expected to sell on the Switch 2. The only third-party game that seems to have had great success on the Switch 2 so far is Cyberpunk 2077, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">Circana reported was the third best-selling game in the US</a> during the Switch 2's launch week.</p>
<p>So, at least on a global scale, it looks like third-party publishers aren't having the best time on Switch 2, with first-party Nintendo games swallowing up all the attention. But at least regionally, according to Circana analyst and executive director Mat Piscatella, third-party game sales for Switch 2 games are doing much better than they were compared to the Switch 1's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 just reached shy of 40%</em>," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">Piscatella writes on BlueSky</a>. "<em>For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's far too early to claim best or worst this or that or whatever when it comes to Switch 2</em>."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibt6po5g6srzn35mitsjizz2fkvfyqigwje2m6u4fxzw2zjbecn5m">
<p lang="en">Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%. For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t?ref_src=embed">2025-06-19T17:15:19.742Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As Piscatella also points out, the Switch 2 has not even been out for a month. We'll have a better look at sales numbers in due time, and there are also plenty of other factors to consider.</p>
<p>For example, the number of Switch's available at launch in 2017 is nowhere close to the number of units Nintendo was prepared with for the Switch 2's launch. There are simply more consoles out in the wild, for people to buy games on.</p>
<p>And that's before getting into the fact that people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games. It's only with the Switch that third-party publishers saw more success on the platform. Piscatella also pointed out in a separate post that as of March 2025, "<em>approximately half of all US owners of either the PS5 or Xbox Series also owned a Switch.</em>"</p>
<p>Someone who has never played Cyberpunk 2077 because they don't have a console or PC to play it on is more likely to buy it now that it's on Switch 2 than someone who bought their Switch 2 to play Mario Kart, and already played Cyberpunk on their current-gen console or high-end PC, and that goes for all third-party titles that are essentially ports to the Switch 2 for games that couldn't run on the Switch.</p>
<p>Again, as Piscatella pointed out, it's far too early to really say how third-party games will perform on the Switch 2. With the new hardware being capable of more 'impossible ports' like the Witcher 3 running on the original Switch, and more new games potentially releasing on Switch 2 alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions, the Switch 2 could still be a good platform for third-party games to thrive.</p>
<p>Though, seemingly that's contingent on whether Nintendo has a new Mario game out for the console at the same time.</p>

But if you’ve gotten good and need a harder challenge, you’ll be able to take on “Everdark Sovereigns,” which are more difficult versions of the game’s Nightlord foes you face to conclude a run.</p><p>“These limited-time versions of the Nightlords are extremely challenging and pose an even greater threat to the Nightfarers with new moves and increased power,” according to <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged">a blog post from Bandai Namco</a>.</p><p>The first Everdark Sovereign you can fight is a new version of Adel, Baron of the Night, aka Gaping Jaw. If you’ve beaten the normal version of that boss, you’ll be able to take on the new form. When you beat an Everdark Sovereign, you’ll get “Sovereign Sigils,” which you can exchange for “special Relics and other items.”</p><p>There are a couple caveats to be aware of. You can only fight Everdark Sovereigns while playing online. And Everdark Sovereigns will only be available for a limited time — the upgraded Gaping Jaw, for example, will stick around until June 25th at 8:59 PM ET.</p><p>Bandai Namco says a new Everdark Sovereign will be added every week, and over the “next few weeks,” Everdark versions of Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight will be added to the game.

            <p>
Crytek had a little bit of an oopsie yesterday with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown 1896's</a> 2.4 update yesterday. As soon as it arrived, there were reports of server problems and issues with buying Blood Bonds. This led to Crytek trying to fix it, taking the game's servers offline to do so, except when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was brought back online, it wasn't with a fixed version of the new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859005?l=english">but version 2.3</a>. However! It looks like the team continued work on getting it fixed (hope you didn't have to crunch too hard, Crytek staff), and the update is back and available to download.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Our team has been working tirelessly to resolve the issues that followed the original rollout, and after extensive testing and final checks, we’re confident in this new release," Crytek explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859184?l=english">Steam post</a>. "We’ll continue monitoring stability closely and remain committed to delivering the best possible experience moving forward." For what it's worth, now that the update is live and stable, <a href="https://x.com/HuntShowdown/status/1935431568409116845">you'll be able to redeem a code for 10,000 Hunt dollars as compensation</a> (I'd also like to take a second to note how funny Hunt dollars is as a name, couldn't figure out anything else huh).
</p>
<p>
In terms of the actual content of the update, also called the Judgement of the Fool update, it goes as follows: there's a new area called The Fool's Hideout to explore, where you can use Pledge Marks to unlock Sealed Rewards. The map DeSalle is back too, "revitalized with significant enhancements." 
</p>
<p>
There's a new Catalyst Trait too, which "unlocks powerful Conditional Trait Effects for specific Traits when they’re equipped on your Hunter." And there's also The Brute, a "formidable offspring of Ursa Mortis" that is stealthy in nature, so keep your wits about you. You can read more about the update in a blog post <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/update-24-judgement-of-the-fool-live-now">here</a>.

She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and transformed into a rock."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-confirms-super-mario-odysseys-pauline-is-your-new-sidekick-and-dk-can-now-transform-into-a-zebra-or-flying-ostrich">Yesterday's reveal of this younger Pauline, during the Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct</a>, strongly suggested she was the same music-loving version of the character seen in Nintendo Switch platformer Super Mario Odyssey, where a grown-up Pauline serves as both the mayor of New Donk City and the lead singer of a popular band.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans have been quick to highlight what this might mean for Pauline's overall timeline — and the fact that DK and Pauline's friendly team-up in Bananza is a very different vibe to the pair's usual relationship of kidnapper and victim. Does something happen to DK, turning him evil? Or have we been getting Pauline and DK's friendship wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza sees the two characters working together to help the teenage Pauline get back to the surface, in order to pursue her dream of becoming a world famous singer. Pauline's appearance as a singer in Odyssey suggests that she does indeed make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Bananza looks story-wise to be an Odyssey prequel, the exact timeline here is somewhat unclear. Nintendo has never stated Pauline's age in Odyssey, or in any of her other appearances, so it's unknown how long before those events it is that Bananza takes place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by linking the character across these games through Pauline's musical ambitions, it also highlights the fact that Odyssey's Pauline does address her kidnapping by DK — something she describes as "traumatic."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pauline has been kidnapped by DK multiple times over the years. Most notably, she is saved from DK's clutches in the original Donkey Kong arcade game, but she is then abducted again in various entries within the Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Pauline is snatched by Donkey Kong after the she dares to pick a gift from Mario instead of DK. In Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!, Pauline is kidnapped once more by an enraged DK, upset that he's missed out on a theme park opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later entries in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series paint Pauline's interactions with DK in a kinder light, however, such as in Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, where the two team up to host a mini-game, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars, where the pair plan Mario a surprise party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does something happen to sour DK and Pauline's relationship at the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, turning the ape from an ally to kidnapper? Will we see the events of the original Donkey Kong arcade game take place within Bananza, perhaps, with Mario coming in to save the day? Or have we been getting it wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have suggested that Bananza will turn the Mario universe on its head by revealing that DK and Pauline are in fact friends — and that Mario has been the villain all along, effectively stealing Pauline back when she's just been hanging out with her pal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully all will be revealed when Donkey Kong Bananza arrives as Nintendo's next major Switch 2 launch on July 17, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-im-completely-in-love-with-mario-kart-worlds-photo-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a7165cabc459/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is the biggest Mario Kart to date. The map is huge, with Easter Eggs and little secrets hiding under bridges, atop towering buildings, and in the middle of sprawling oceans. Knockout Tour is the most chaotic concoction of multiplayer I've ever seen. And I'm still knee-deep in unlocking characters (darn, Kamek...).</p>
<p>And yet, here I am to talk about photo mode. <em>Bloody</em> photo mode, you're probably thinking. A modern-day video game checkbox. Probably 60% of games have a photo mode nowadays, either at launch or patched in at a later date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> are just a few Nintendo first-party games that have some way of taking expressive pics of your characters.</p>
<p>But, news flash, I love it in Mario Kart World more than any of those other games.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb7ab61f2bbb7/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look, see, a <em>real</em> newsflash! — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having spent a <em>lot</em> of time with Mario Kart World over the past couple weeks, and absolutely loving it, it's not the deeper mechanics, the chaotic racing, or the chillness of exploring the open world that have really stuck with me. It's how loud and expressive it lets you be, both in and out of the game. I touched on it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">in my review</a> in terms of the animations and visuals, but I think this applies across everything, particularly photo mode.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, Nintendo seems to have given Mario a new lease of life. Remakes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi</a> entry are indicative of that (Odyssey also just about fits the bill). These games represent Mario, Luigi, and a whole host of other characters, old and new, at their most colourful, their most jovial, and their most <em>stupid</em> in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World carries that torch but in an entirely new setting — not a 2D platformer or turn-based RPG, not even with any dialogue. This is a kart racer with over 100 costumes, multiple biomes, and 50 different characters ranging from classics like Peach and Wario to the stupidest of choices, like the Cow, Cataquack, and Peepa. I can drive around as <em>Peepa</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario 3D Land</a>.</p>
<p>Photo mode, to me, is an extension of the daft playfulness that's alive and well in the Mushroom Kingdom right now. It goes beyond just being an easy, fun way of sharing screenshots online or with friends. As with the best photo modes, it's about expressing yourself and the moment.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm way too deep into this, but a lot goes into a Mario Kart World photo. Which character would suit which location? What about the kart? Or a bike? Which costume? Do I want other racers in the shot? Enemies? Which pose looks best? What mood do I want to convey? Do I use a frame?</p>
<p>I'm not a professional photographer — please don't ask me to take good photos of any animal that isn't my cat — but when it comes to these kinds of shots, with this variety of characters? I'm all in.</p>
<p>Let's take Yoshi in his Biker outfit, for example. He <em>has</em> to be in the W-Twin Chopper (nothing else goes with those shades), and we need somewhere either suitably muddy <em>or</em> very cool to look effortless. So, off to Choco Mountain I went, driving around, looking for the best spots to frame my photo.</p>
<p>The muddy chocolate makes things a little tougher around here; you'll drown if you stay in it too long, and item boxes weren't giving me Mushrooms so I could zip over the little pools. But then a Feather and a curved wall gave me the chance to do something that looks easy as hell, but really isn't. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-wall-ride">Wall riding</a>...</p>

<p>Et voilà! Something that conveys a very cute character, looking very cool in the moment, with shades, a leather jacket, and a very suitable vehicle.</p>
<p>Or, you know, sometimes I just get really stupid ideas and decide to put Bowser, in a similar biker outfit, in Lil' Dumpy. As soon as I unlocked the costume for the king of Koopas, I knew immediately I was going to do something ridiculous with it. And, there you have it:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a911293fce4e8/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I don't always use frames, but when I do... — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a franchise with over 40 years of history behind it, Mario has done a <em>lot</em> of things, and that also gives me a chance to relive, and re-experiment, with those moments. One of my favourite shots was a complete coincidence as I was driving around collecting P Switches in the snowy regions of Free Roam.</p>
<p>I went off-road after driving down from Starview Peak, hoping to find a big, blue button to bash my head against multiple times. But what I got instead was a goldmine: A group of penguins gathered around an oil drum.</p>
<p>Nintendo references Mario's hatred of penguins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mq4uCJDwO9U?si=ZRWLAc_HKVcnb8Y4&amp;t=726">in the Mario Kart World Direct</a> (we've all thrown the penguin off of Cool, Cool Mountain in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, right?), but what if the penguin wanted to take revenge? Luckily, penguin just happens to be a character in Mario Kart World, and in my eyes, he craves <em>violence</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51fd5573ded2f/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the sheer expressiveness of the game and the vastness of the world, the moment-to-moment action is just so easy to snapshot, and because every single moment can cause complete chaos, there are so many chances to put characters in danger for the sheer sake of art.</p>
<p>This makes me sound bad, doesn't it? I'm sure if Mario and friends were real, they'd hate me for putting them in perilous situations. But they're not all life-threatening; firing Daisy out of barrel cannons on the bridge between Faraway Oasis and Crown City is just kind of delightful, and getting into a heated contest with your brother brings out the drama.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, and all of that hooting and hollering while you're racing — groaning from being hit by a Blue Shell or cheering as you knock your best friend off the course and push them down 10 places in an instant — can be <em>captured</em> in an instant.</p>
<p>Plus, we can finally find out what happens when a Cataquack encounters another Cataquack:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/597826d37dddb/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Knockout Tour is still my favourite thing about this game, and in those moments where I'm scrambling to make it into the top 16, or top 8, or simply just aim to win, I forget all about taking snapshots because I'm on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>But when I do want to channel my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Macmillan">Iain Macmillan</a> or <a href="https://www.kymillman.com/photography/formula-1/?srsltid=AfmBOoojdRYkIwFQ2bUpN7gdY_TmHRD08qkIuwYam7MZ0JfTlNyISzbx">Kym Illman</a>, Mario Kart World lets me capture the action, the calm, the fun, and the drama, with aplomb. May Mario and friends <em>always</em> feel this alive and expressive. I can't wait to mess around with it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, too.</p>
<p>Or, you know, I could just admire the food. I <em>need</em> those Boo Buns in my life.</p>

<h3>The Nintendo Life Mario Kart World Photo Gallery</h3>
<p>As a little bonus, I thought it would be fun to round up a few shots from the NL Crew of their Mario Kart World escapades.</p>
<p>First up is reviewer extraordinaire PJ, who's making sure Mario gets some exercise in while riding along the high roads. Good for him! Love the little Baby Blooper, too — one of my favourite four-wheel vehicles in the game</p>

<p>Okay, next is a DK pic from our esteemed editor Gavin. Oh, uh, erm...no! Stop. Oh god... it's a photo of the popular Nintendo character Donkey Kong, as supplied by Gavin, you dirty people. There's some Waluigi here too, so you can keep your minds out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>buns</em>. We like buns, right?</p>

<p>Following on from <em>that</em> fiasco, we have my trusty P Switch comrade Jim; he's taken a shine to the lovely little Monty Mole. Simple, effective, adorable — and look, there's even <em>another</em> Monty! Thanks, Moo Moo Meadows!</p>

<p>Last, but absolutely not least, Ollie has caught Baby Mario in the act — how on earth did he manage to get the biggest ice cream?? Also, thanks Ollie for reminding me that bees can be dangerous. Good for nature, not good for... crabs?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During our <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025 interview with Tymon Smektała</a>, we asked the Techland Dying Light Franchise Director whether there were any plans to bring Dying Light: The Beast to the Nintendo Switch 2 console. Without promising anything, Smektała was very open about his desire to do it at some stage:</p>
<p><em>I would love this to happen at some point, but nothing to announce at this time.</em></p>
<p>On one hand, Techland's Director has detailed several technical improvements made to the C-Engine for Dying Light: The Beast:</p>
<p><em>We have also improved the visuals a lot. Our in-house C-Engine engine went through a number of iterations. Now, all the weather effects, the rendering of materials, lighting, shadows, and how the sun moves in the sky. All of those things are on a completely different level compared to Dying Light 2: Stay Human.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, the game is one of the very few to be still targeting a launch on old-generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) in 2025. As such, there's little doubt that the Nintendo Switch 2 could run the game in terms of raw power. It's rather a matter of opportunity, then. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch sales</a> it's had so far, it would seem like a no-brainer to bring a game to Nintendo's console, but that doesn't mean it would be easy for the Polish developer.</p>
<p>The first Dying Light only launched on the Switch six and a half years after the game's original debut in 2015. It took the opportunity to gather all DLCs into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-platinum-edition-leaked-due-on-thursday-may-27th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platinum Edition</a> that launched everywhere and added the Switch version. Whether Techland plans to do the same for this 'unofficial third game' remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dying Light 2: Stay Human was announced to be coming to the original Nintendo Switch through a cloud version that, however, never materialized.</p>

It turns out the old Zuck mantra "move fast and break things" only gets you so far when you're troubleshooting galaxies.
</p>
<p>
"We've released a tremendous number of patches since then at a rapid rate - but our patch cadence has become problematic (and even counterproductive) in some ways," Muray writes. "Too often in game development, fixing one bug introduces another - and I haven't been giving our internal QA testers enough time to fully vet and test the changes we've been making. 
</p>
<p>
"Examples from recent patches include a few weeks ago when an unrelated fix to a pop issue caused Wilderness empires to seemingly randomly destroy themselves by killing all of their biomass, or when another fix just after that caused save games to corrupt and become unloadable," he goes on.
</p>
<p>
Paradox remain "committed" to patching Stellaris, which has sunk to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">a Mixed Steam user review consensus</a> following the release of the apparently cataclysmic 4.0 update, but they'll be "taking a more measured and deliberate approach to allow internal testing to catch up while giving you a more stable environment to play the game in". 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, they're shifting the emphasis to open betas that bring together QA work and player feedback more organically - the first of these will be updated "on a weekly to fortnightly basis depending on internal progress throughout the summer", with "the next 4.0.x live release" due sometime in August. Muray suggests that modders who "have been waiting for a moment of stability" take advantage of the shortage of major changes during that period.
</p>
<p>
As for what exactly they'll be patching next, please summon your mother back upstairs, for it is once again time to defeat and confuse her with the kind of preposterous sci-fantasy jargon she never ever imagined her darling baby would ever learn, back when you were just a wee tyke nuzzling at the nipple.
</p>
<p>
"I'm personally currently looking at ways to improve the AI's behavior," Muray continues. "Other things currently in active development are OOS investigations, a number of strata issues that affect slavery, purging, and other oddities among pop employment, and more of a design change rather than a bugfix - based on your feedback we're looking at having newly grown pops go straight into the Civilian stratum or its appropriate equivalent instead of being unemployed members of their parent pop group. 
</p>
<p>
"While we liked the verisimilitude of top-heavy planets having more stability issues than ones that were more evenly developed, we acknowledge that having a persistent trickle of unemployed pops feels wrong," Muray continues.</p>
<p>Did you hear that, mum? He took the words right out of my mouth. Mother, will you stop weeping and fetch me my abacus so I can calculate the performance losses from the bug "where every empire was calculating their Biomass total far too often". No, I do not want to speak to the careers advisor again. Yes, I will be eating dinner in my room this evening.

			<p>Bandai Namco has announced it will host a Little Nightmares Showcase for next week on <strong>June 24, 2025, at 12pm PST / 5pm EST / 8pm BST</strong>.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a short post to the <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">Little Nightmares III official X account</a>, with a short video clip showing the date and time of the showcase and the caption "<em>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think. Are you ready to face it, little ones?</em>"</p>
<p>That's all Bandai shared about the showcase, though we can infer that it'll include good deal of information on the next entry in the Little Nightmares series, Little Nightmares III, which is still without an official release date after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gets-delayed-to-2025/">delayed last year</a> and pushed into 2025.</p>
<p>Though a release date hasn't been officially confirmed, a product listing for Little Nightmares III on Target (spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/539541/article/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-potentially-leaked/">Gameranx</a>) has the release date set for September 15, 2025. We'll find out next week if that leak was correct.</p>
<p>It'll also be interesting to see more of Little Nightmares III, as this is the first game in the series that isn't being developed by the series creators at Tarsier Studios. Supermassive Games has taken over the series, and while the initial clips and previews suggest that it'll stay very close to the kind of game Tarsier already established, Supermassive will undoubtedly bring their own flair to the games in some way.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo previewed the game at Gamescom 2024,</a> he wrote that from the top of the demo, "<em>there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>So far, some of the key differences seem to be that the characters in Little Nightmares III can use a series of weapons, but no doubt, there are more changes yet to be revealed, even if it's all staying close to what we all know to be a Little Nightmares game.</p>
