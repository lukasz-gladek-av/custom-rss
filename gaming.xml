            <p>
Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s female V are both set to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
The crossover is expected to go live tonight, with the characters and various accessories available to buy in the game's shop.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games confirmed the crossover and showed off the appearance of the characters within Fortnite yesterday, in a post on social media that teased: "We're expecting some guests from Night City."

<p>
It's perhaps not surprising to see Cyberpunk 2077 turn up in Fortnite - its developer CD Projekt Red has forged close ties with Epic Games through its switch to Unreal Engine for future development (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">first trailer for The Witcher 4</a>, and our first look at The Witcher's world in Unreal, debuted this month at The Game Awards). And the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-4-starts-tomorrow-with-geralt-and-doomslayer">Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri all joined Fortnite previously</a>.
</p><p>
Fun fact: this will be Keanu Reeves' second character in Fortnite, after his previous addition as John Wick. But he's not the first actor to get into the game twice. Zendaya (in her Spider-Man and Dune guises) and Harrison Ford (as both Han Solo and Indiana Jones) have also previously found their way into Fortnite more than once.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's latest additions come amidst a typically-busy end of year season for the game. Its Winterfest event is now on offering daily free cosmetic rewards (leading up to a Santa Snoop Dogg skin on Christmas day), heralded by the in-game arrival of Mariah Carey from a giant block of ice. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-and-plungerman-plop-into-fortnite">Skibidi Toilet is now in the game too</a>.

        <p>Key members of original dev team say they were ready and willing to make a sequel.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA reportedly rejected proposals to create a brand new Dead Space game.</p>
<p>Glen Schofield - who directed the original game and went on to co-found both Sledgehammer Games and Callisto Protocol studio, Striking Distance - said that EA shut down a proposal for "Dead Space 4", saying it wasn't "interested right now".</p>
<p>The news follows EA's launch of the critically-acclaimed Dead Space Remake in January 2023, but uncertainty over the franchise's future.</p>

<p>"We tried actually, you know, the three of us. We tried Dead Space 4," Schofield said in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/cU5PrEr1HjM?t=5480">Dan Allen Gaming</a>, alongside his former colleagues, creative director Bret Robbins and animation director Christopher Stone. "We're talking this year."</p><p>"We didn't go too deep. They just said, no, we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and you know, we know who to talk to, so we didn't take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so..."</p>
<p>"All three of us sat down and wanted to do it," Stone added. "The industry is in a weird place right now. People are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you've got to take it with a grain of salt, who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we've got some ideas," Schofield teased.</p>
<p>When asked by Allen if they'd really return to the horror series, Stone said: "I'd make a Dead Space 4," and Schofield simply said: "Yes."</p>
<p>When Bret Robbins didn't say anything, Schofield pointed out that Robbins had "a good game going" given he was "having a great time" working with Dan Houser at Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, rumours swirled that despite the Dead Space Remake's critical acclaim, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-series-reportedly-on-ice-following-sequel-remake-rumours">whole series was reportedly "on ice"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A Dead Space 4 game is something fans have been yearning for ever since the third mainline installment was released over ten years ago. Of course, the closure of Visceral Games in October 2017 while they were making the Star Wars project codenamed Ragtag threw a big wrench into those plans, but the remake of the first game released by Motive Studios in early 2023 certainly rekindled hopes - at least until the sales, despite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid critical reception</a>, turned out to be too low, and publisher EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to put the IP back on the shelf.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with YouTuber Dan Allen Gaming</a>, three of the original franchise creators (Bret Robbins, Glen Schofield, and Christopher Stone) revealed that they actually pitched Dead Space 4 to Electronic Arts in 2024. Needless to say, they weren't successful.</p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> We tried, actually, you know, the three of us, for Dead Space 4. I mean, we're talking this year. We didn't go too deep; they just said we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah. We know who to talk to, so we didn't go and take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so yeah.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Christopher Stone:</strong> The industry is in a weird place right now, and people are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you got to, you know, take it with a grain of salt. Who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do Dead Space 4.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> Yeah. We got some ideas.</em></p>
<p>It is likely that they pitched it too soon to Electronic Arts following the unsuccessful release of the remake. The trio tried anyway because they were all free at the time, following their own games that didn't go as well as planned. Bret Robbins was the founder of Ascendant Studios and Game Director on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, which flopped hard, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive layoffs at the studio</a>. Glen Schofield and Christopher Stone were Game Director and Chief Creative Officer at Striking Distance Studios on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Callisto Protocol</a>, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-reportedly-cost-over-160-million-to-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly unsuccessful compared to its budget</a>.</p>
<p>Now, all three have new jobs. This September, Bret Robbins joined Absurd Ventures, the new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-creator-dan-houser-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created</a> in 2021 by Rockstar's Dan Houser, as Game Director on an unannounced project. Christopher Stone became Studio General Manager of VOID Interactive, the developer behind the tactical FPS game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready or Not</a>, in August. And Schofield? Here's what he said in the video interview:</p>
<p><em>I have been working on a smaller project. We're trying to get funding right now. It's a pretty exciting project. It's smaller, and I'm not directing; I'm going to be executive producing it.&nbsp;When you hear what it's about, if we get the funding, you'll understand. It's something kind of special for me.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like it will be some time before the trio are ready to pitch Dead Space 4 again. Fans might want to prepare for a long wait, but at least they still intend to make it at some point - EA willing, of course.</p>

<p>VALORANT coach Christine “potter” Chi has signed a three-year contract extension with Evil Geniuses. With the deal signed, potter will be under contract with Evil Geniuses through at least the 2027 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses has officially completed its roster in the final days of 2024, gearing up for the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season in the Americas league.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-evil-geniuses-seek-return-to-championship-glory">Evil Geniuses Seek Return to Championship Glory</h2>



<p>Potter signed a three-year, “max-length” contract with Evil Geniuses through 2027. The only other coach in VCT Americas with a contract through 2027, per <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRmmWiBmMMD43m5VtZq54nKlmj0ZtythsA1qCpegwx-iRptx2HEsG0T3cQlG1r2AIiKxBWnaurJZQ9Q/pubhtml#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Global Contract Database</a>, is 100 Thieves’ Anthony “Zikz” Gray. Zikz, a long-time coach in League of Legends who switched to VALORANT, was potter’s assistant coach during EG’s unexpected world championship run in 2023. The assistant coach for EG last year, Mike “pho” Panza, has also returned for the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses CEO Chris DeAppolonio, in a press release today, called potter the “lynchpin” of EG’s VALORANT program, . “There’s no one else I’d want at the helm. With Potter’s leadership and passion, EG will always contend for the VALORANT World Championship.”</p>



<p>The re-signing of potter completes EG’s offseason ahead of the start of the 2025 season. The team opted to re-sign returning players Derrek “Derrek” Ha, Nicholas “NaturE” Garrison and Phat “Supamen” Le. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/">Two new additions in Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker and Jacob “icy” Lange</a> were announced Friday. Excluding icy, who was on the team’s reserve roster at the time, potter is the only remaining name from the 2023 Champions roster.</p>



<p>The full field of 12 teams in VCT Americas all made changes to their starting rosters during this offseason period.</p>



<p>How do you think potter and Evil Geniuses stack up against other VALORANT teams heading into VCT 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The game has already picked up over 20 million players and shows no signs of stopping. Which is cool but also very surprising!</p><p>I think I speak for many of us when I ask: Weren’t we done with hero shooters? After the market was saturated with them and <em>Overwatch 2</em> turned out to be a slow-moving train wreck, it felt like the trend of having a colorful roster of heroes shoot each other over moving a payload was done. <em>Concord</em>, Sony’s failed hero shooter, seemed to really cement that when it launched and died in just about 4 weeks earlier this year. And yet, here we all are playing and loving <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, a free-to-play hero shooter with a big roster and plenty of payloads to move. Life is funny sometimes, huh?</p><p>Because <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is such a big hit, with many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> playing it, we’ve also been thinking about it a lot and writing up guides, stories, and other posts about it. So here’s everything we’ve written about <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in 2024 in one handy-dandy location.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-recommend-id="image://1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-recommend-id="image://1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is the hottest new thing in the realm of hero shooters. And, it has launched with over 30 popular characters from the Marvel universe.

So, if you’re new to the game (or even hero shooters in general), here are three characters that are easy to pick up and play. — Billy Givens</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-characters-beginner-starting-squirrel-gir-1851716341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-characters-beginner-starting-squirrel-gir-1851716341">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-recommend-id="image://dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-recommend-id="image://dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is out now and free to play on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. The hero shooter pretty shamelessly draws inspiration from <em>Overwatch</em>. As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae that are different and worth keeping in mind, even if you’ve spent hundreds of hours in similar games. I put about 15 hours into <em>Marvel Rivals</em> during its test periods and about a few additional hours since its launch on December 5.

That’s because fans had discovered a way to immediately charge the Sorcerer Supreme’s ultimate ability to full with just one well-placed portal. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-patch-notes-doctor-strange-portal-ult-1851717418&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-patch-notes-doctor-strange-portal-ult-1851717418">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82bd3d953746625eed6b7d686dc784cf" data-recommend-id="image://82bd3d953746625eed6b7d686dc784cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff looks at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jeff looks at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82bd3d953746625eed6b7d686dc784cf" data-recommend-id="image://82bd3d953746625eed6b7d686dc784cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff looks at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>launched last week, and as fans are flocking to the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in droves</a></span>, they’re also figuring out who their favorite and least favorite characters are on the hero shooter’s roster.

            <p>Just 15 percent of Steam players spent time with new releases - defined as games released in 2024 - this year.</p>
<p>That's according to Steam itself, which gave us a little insight into the broader playing habits of its players as part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/641297020996289523">Steam Replay 2024</a>.</p>

<p>This year, the recap not only shows you how many games you played and when, but also your favourite genres, the achievements you unlocked (the median was 13), the number of games played (for most, this is four), and your longest streak (the average was six days, apparently).</p>
<p>"How many games did you play, and how does that compare to last year? Did you unlock a bunch of achievements? What about your longest streak? These fun numbers and more are in your Replay," Valve teases.</p>

<p>Initially, the case concerned just two companies - Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios - but a court document recently showed the motion for class certification has been approved.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It might seem odd to suggest that a game filled to the brim with tough-as-nails twitch action games, thinky arcade puzzlers, and even a full-blown narrative RPG is not nostalgic, but UFO 50, a compilation of 50 retro-inspired games of varying sizes, is full of surprises. It has its influences, of course. Magical Garden pulls on Snake. Valtress is something of a cross between Kid Icarus and Downwell. It has a steady dedication to looking and sounding like games of the past. However, UFO 50 draws as much on 2000s era game jam culture as the NES itself. Rather than a mere evocation of retro titles, UFO 50 has a longing for creative constriction. Each individual game's simplicity serves a widening and deepening, a desire to pull as much as possible out of every pixel. UFO 50 creates the feeling of wide-openness, that video games can be anything. This is a feeling that has only thrived on the margins in video games and thus un-markable as a generalized nostalgia. When big business wants you to believe the new hotness represents all that video games can be, it is refreshing to look backward and forward at once.</p><p dir="ltr">To my mind, UFO 50's retro aesthetic serves two purposes. First, it keeps games resource-light. Each game is bare in construction, often lacking explicit tutorialization. Most games have a mere six buttons to play with. It maintains the mysterious workings and iterations of arcade games, without the quarter-munching business model. Each game can only be so big lest it outscope the rest. So, the focus is on mechanical density and complexity, on the kind of replayability that comes from careful design, not endless racks of content. The feeling is closer to setting up an emulator loaded with cult classics than to a childhood memory of getting an 8-bit console for Christmas.</p><p dir="ltr">Second, the retro vibes focus on each game's individual decisions and ideas. Some of UFO 50's games--like Campanella, its sequel, and The Big Bell Race--have obvious relationships to each other. Others--like the surreal Waldorf's Journey and the strategic Avianos--feel as if they come from different worlds. However, all of UFO 50's games feel as if they are made of the same component parts: pixels, code, a few buttons. Yet there is so much possibility. The simplicity draws out the span of what is possible. It makes each new trick feel remarkable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413167" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413167"></a><figcaption>An example of the grid-based strategy game Avianos, where birds choose which Dinos to worship in order to gain strategic advantages.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of UFO 50's most-striking games is Mooncat, a two-button platform puzzler. Most of the game, at least on the first run, is found in learning how it works. You control a two-legged creature, presumably the titular mooncat, which moves in combinations and timings between its two buttons. There's a jump, a ground pound, a little dash, and the basic movement left to right, but none of these moves are done in the conventional way; all prior knowledge of how video games are "supposed" to work vanishes. The art direction is whimsical and odd, but with no small amount of menace. Green fields populated by little critters turn into ancient tombs interlaced with gigantic skeletons and harsh deserts overseen by a red sky. It is the sort of game that is difficult to imagine being an actual commercial product, even in 1985. Its presence among more straightforward games showcases that UFO 50 is experimental. Sometimes its offerings will fit into genre conventions, but often they won't.</p><p dir="ltr">Fittingly, UFO 50's meta-narrative focuses on unearthing a forgotten catalog rather than revisiting classics. Its opening "cutscene" shows members of the UFO 50 team finding the game's fictional console in an old storage unit. This is not something enshrined in the annals of gaming history or the kind of thing you could (easily) discover at your local retro shop. It's overlooked. That's the reason the game opens on a storage unit rather than a mom-and-pop shop or a lovingly maintained collection (contrast this with retro collections like The Sega Master Collection, which features a main menu designed like a childhood bedroom). UFO 50's main menu focuses on the games themselves, showing cartridges. But they are not arranged on a shelf; instead, they are covered in cobwebs. Selecting a game you haven't yet played dusts it off. It's cutesy to be sure, but it conjures the archive more than the basement.</p><p dir="ltr">All this is to say, UFO 50 presents itself as an excavation rather than a return to the past. It wants you to discover, not to rediscover. There is no past to return to. Even in UFO 50's internal fiction, you are playing these games right now, not in some imaginary 1980s. The emphasis on discovery has a double effect: It helps these games feel alive and helps you approach them on their own merits, not just as mere echoes of the past. It is uncloying, dignified, but still playful.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413169" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413169"></a><figcaption>A level from Campanella, showcasing a tiny UFO, some slime-like critters, and a little maze of obstacles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I've made a lot of UFO 50's reduction, but it is also excessive. It's 50 whole games! It would be possible to write at length about any of them individually. But its excess is found in the wealth of its experience, in the diversity it presents itself with. Most big-budget video games are large and excessive, but they tend to emphasize the same tasks over and over and all feed into some meta goal. While it would take over a hundred hours to completely finish every one of UFO 50's offerings, each game is also a complete experience in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">There's some melancholy to UFO 50's unique position. <a href="https://pastebin.com/538TpwCp" rel="nofollow ">Critic Liz Ryerson describes UFO 50</a> as "about a sort of lost innocence for games and what they could be before they became a massive dominant cultural industry." Now video games, or at least the business of video games, is a relatively narrow set of genres. Open worlds have codified into Ubisoft bloat. Live-service games chase the brand integration of Fortnite or the expansion of Genshin Impact. Call of Duty has been the dominant first-person shooter for well over a decade. Mainstream games have lost their experimental edge. UFO 50 is perhaps the biggest scale that an experimental game can operate in. That's still pretty small.</p><p dir="ltr">Nevertheless, UFO 50 is worth celebrating. I have often lamented the lack of Martin Scorceses in video games. I don't long for more crime dramas or invocations of Catholic dread, but rather I want more game developers that admire video games' past. I want more developers who gesture to history not out of empty, preening nostalgia, but rather out of respect for it, out of a genuine willingness to learn from it, and a desire, not to replace or improve the past, but to expand and deepen our relationship to it. UFO 50 is a small but confident and exciting step in that direction.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
