            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Happy Friday! It is the end of a week of annual leave for me though, so it is a deflated Friday for me. I have been on my hollibobs with my Switch, and while I had set out to play a bunch of things, the only thing I played was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> for hours, and hours and hours. You can have my full review of it next week!</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, is at that Gamescom, playing all sorts of things, including the awesome-looking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">No Ghosts at the Grand</a>. He will have loads of things to tell you about in the next few weeks as well, so definitely look out for that.</p>

<p>Aran has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/tiny-bookshop-review/">Tiny Bookshop</a> for review, saying,&nbsp; “It is such a chilled out game. It may be my game of the year!” Strong words for the end of August!</p>
<p>Gamoc has been playing Echoes of the End for review, which he loves, as well as a bit of Death Stranding and Smash Bros.</p>

<p>Jim is still chipping away at Far Cry 5 and although some of the open-world activities are starting to repeat themselves, there are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh. He says, “I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>

<p>Ade polished off his reviews for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>. He also played through the side-scrolling cheerleader beat ’em up Ra Ra Boom with Laura for her review. He’s been packing the gaming in this week though, continuing, “I’ve also tried the new Rogue Prince of Persia on PlayStation Plus – which is excellent – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters. Though most of my gaming time has been spent playing Marvel Rivals! I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third.”</p>
<p>Laura has been playing Ra Ra Boom, telling us, “The title of which must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos) with @Ade. We love a good side-scrolling beat em up and Ra Ra Boom (sing it!) has such a gorgeous art style!”</p>

<p>Steve has been deeply immersed in three completely different postapocalyptic settings (four if you count the state of the real world) but two of those are super secret so he’s just been playing, “The continuing adventures of Wuchang super sexy bird girl which is still following the pattern of being really enjoyable until I spend hours bashing my head against a brick wall boss.”</p>
<p>Finally, Miguel has been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a few rounds in the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8!</p>
<p>So then, have you been playing anything this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher A Plus and developer Shanghai Bokura Network Technology have announced that Blue Protocol: Star Resonance will arrive on PC, iOS, and Android this coming October 2025. Pre-registration for mobile players also kicks off today, as well as the closed beta test for participants on PC.</p>



<p>If you're looking to play Blue Protocol: Star Resonance on mobile, then you can pre-register for the game on its <a href="https://www.playbpsr.com/">official website</a>. If you'd rather check it out on PC, then instead of just waiting for its October launch, you can jump into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/">closed beta test through Steam</a> starting today. If you missed the chance to sign up for the beta test, A Plus has confirmed that it will "<em>continuously release codes depending on the server capacity after the test begins</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Blue Protocol: Star Resonance | Closed Beta Test Recruitment" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Px_DtSUjs4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Star Resonance marks the return of the MMORPG after the original Blue Protocol release, which first arrived in Japan in 2023, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/">shut down a year later,</a> and had its release outside of Japan cancelled. It officially shut down this past January, with the reason for its closure simply being that it was unable to garner enough of a player base to keep going.</p>



<p>If you're happy to see it return and are looking forward to its October launch, beyond the closed beta test, A Plus has confirmed that attendees at the Anime NYC convention will be able to check out a playable demo of the game.</p>

      <div><p>Stone Blade Entertainment recently launched a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em>. The campaign celebrating a milestone for the iconic deckbuilding game is a runaway success, reaching its goal within minutes of it going live.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/stoneblade/ascension-15th-anniversary#/section/rewards/reward-product-85307" rel="nofollow"><em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em></a> provides both newcomers and veteran players a pristine version of the game, complete with a promotional embossed tin case, foil cards, and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong-is-out-soon-and-indie-games-are-getting-out-of-the-way.1278348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> developers Team Cherry announced a September 4th release date for the long-awaited game, and indie developers are announcing delays to get out of the way of the launch. <em>Silksong</em> is a full sequel to the excellent <em>Hollow Knight</em> and is currently the most wishlisted game on Steam, so it’s likely going to be very popular when it’s finally available.</p><p>Panik Arcade, which was set to release its “hellish gambling roguelike” <em>CloverPit</em> on September 3rd, has pushed the game’s launch to September 26th. “We poured our hearts into our little game so of course we want to give it the best possible shot,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F3314790%2Fview%2F520848458437886253" rel="sponsored">Panik Arcade says</a>. “We hope you can understand — we’ll use the extra time of course to polish the game even further and we hope for your support at launch either way.”</p><p>Talegames, which was planning to launch the adventure RPG <em>Faeland</em> out of early access on September 9th, is postponing the release and plans to share a new date soon. “This wasn’t an easy decision,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1280080%2FFaeland%2F" rel="sponsored">Talegames says</a>. “We’ve poured years of work and love into <em>Faeland</em>, and we want to make sure it arrives at a time when it can receive the attention and care it deserves.”</p><p>Aeternum Game Studios, which is developing a 2D sidescrolling game focused on combat and exploration called <em>Aeterna Lucis</em>, <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">is postponing</a> a planned September release to sometime in 2026 because the game “wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves.” Aeternum also says that it still doesn’t have the development kits to “ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms,” so the delay means it can “bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.”</p><p>Frogteam Games, which is working on the 2D exploration game <em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</em>, is delaying a planned August 29th demo launch, as spotted <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays">by <em>Aftermath</em></a>. “Trying to market an indie game is already really, really hard,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2837590%2FStomp_and_the_Sword_of_Miracles%2F" rel="sponsored">Frogteam Games says</a>. It’s the task of trying to get attention in a deep sea of other amazing games. In the case of <em>Silksong</em>, however, I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale. Tiny devs like me rely on word of mouth and streamers to bring in visibility, and everyone’s gonna be busy with <em>Silksong</em> for quite a while!</p><p>Even with these delays, early September is still packed with notable game releases, including Necrosoft Games’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1900250%2FDemonschool%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Demonschool</em></a> (September 3rd), Rogue Factor’s <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-US/hell-is-us?srsltid=AfmBOopyqoJA7xkXuNy6kkA0Y7NrJpCZgYeUYqUce5c3lw90_m77bDYL"><em>Hell is Us</em></a> (September 4th), and Bloober Team’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272787/bloober-gets-bloody-in-its-next-game"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> (September 5th). We’ve reached out to the developers of those games to ask if they are changing their release plans because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680636/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">of <em>Silksong</em></a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 22nd</strong>: Added the delay for the demo of </em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles<em>.</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I did not expect to meet Mozart in Shovel Game, nor did I expect him to ask me to mine a pyramid of shit, with the helpful advice that I start at the top to avoid any floating shitbricks. Mozart is probably the least interesting thing about Shovel Game, actually.</p>
<p>It's a shortform first-person oddity with Minecraft-style destructible voxels (yes I know Minecraft doesn't really use voxels) and a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/action-half-life-the-5-a-m">AHL_5am</a>. The idea is to tunnel through "a sequence of strange and unfamiliar spaces". Here's a trailer.

<p>Only certain blocks can be mined, and you'll want to dig with caution, because the catacombs are full of groaning, wailing sprites that look like Zordon from Power Rangers. It's as if somebody had cracked the glass on his energy tube, freeing the galactic wizard's blobby visage to wander the Earth in pain. Enemies kill you on contact and I've yet to discover any weapons, just my trusty shovel and an 8-ball - purpose unknown.
</p><p>It's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3869670/Shovel_Game/">Steam</a>, but you can find <a href="https://lukewasthefish.itch.io/shovel-game">a demo on Itch.io</a>. Expect plenty of aggravation: there's a labyrinth full of oozy blue phantoms that requires fast footwork. Also a kind of cosmic chapel full of what appear to be flattened babies. The developer is Luke Vincent, who created it for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tfrjam-002/entries">"shovelware horror" gamejam</a>, ho ho.</p>
<p>Bonus game mention: leafing through the submissions page for that jam, I discover a new work from Mike Klubnika, architect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-mike-klubnika">S.p.l.i.t.</a>, which Nic had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/split-review">eloquent emotions about</a>. Co-developed with James Dornan, Klubnika's jam game is called <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/crank-it">Crank It</a> and is about being stuck behind a set of gadgets in a cavernous hallway, trying to spot horrible creatures. Got to say, this sounds far worse than shit pyramid Mozart.</p>

              <p><span>David Hayter, the long-time voice of Snake in the </span><i><span>Metal Gear Solid </span></i><span>series, is just like any other creative. He, like most of us who spend years improving our craft, looks back at older work and wishes he could iron out some of the wrinkles. Maybe you wish you’d sung a different note, chosen other words to express an idea, or posed the subject of a painting a little differently. In Hayter’s case, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-3-mgs3-mgs4-konami-2000619259"><i><span>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</span></i></a><span> has him wishing the remake had allowed him to re-record his 20-year-old lines.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/mgs-delta-snake-eater-voice-talent-interview"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, Hayter, alongside The Boss actor Lori Alan and the vocalist behind the game’s music, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cynthia-harrell-the-woman-who-sang-snake-eater-is-rea-1845440278"><span>Cynthia Harrell</span></a><span>, reflects on the experience of working on the original </span><i><span>Snake Eater</span></i><span> game that launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004. Each of them was surprised to learn that a </span><i><span>Snake Eater</span></i><span> remake was in the works, but they were more surprised that they were asked to contribute to it. Alan told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span> she would have expected to be recast, but that’s not the route Konami took. Instead, </span><i><span>Delta</span></i><span> primarily reuses the 20-year-old recordings from the original. However, Hayter and Alan did hop back in the booth to update some lines for the game’s tutorials. Hayter says that while he’s always down to play Snake again, he wishes Konami would let him re-record his whole performance after gaining 20 more years of acting experience.</span></p> <p><span>“I do feel that I’m a little better of an actor now than I was then,” Hayter told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span>. “It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I’ve picked up over the past 20 years to it. But you don’t want the [new tutorial] lines to be better acted all of a sudden, because that’ll take you out of the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While Hayter’s involvement in the remake was small, he’s hopeful this means the series is making a comeback after it went on ice following director Hideo Kojima’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/report-kojima-finally-leaves-konami-to-start-his-own-s-1748162428"><span>departure from Konami</span></a><span> in 2015, the laughably misguided survival game </span><i><span>Metal Gear Survive</span></i><span> in 2018 notwithstanding.</span></p> <p><span>“Anytime they ask me to be Snake, I’m in,” Hayter told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span>. “It’s the definitive role in my life. It’s so complex and so profound, and there are so many different aspects to both him and Big Boss. So anytime it comes up, I’m down.”</span></p> <p><span>For more on the </span><i><span>Snake Eater </span></i><span>remake, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><span>check out </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s review</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-meat-boy-3d-hands-on-preview-plenty-of-meat-left-on-the-bloody-bone.1278336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Super Meat Boy 3D is just as frustrating, just as hair-pulling and soul-destroying, and just as fun as the original—maybe more. Super Meat Boy Forever shifted the focus from freedom and autonomy to auto-running, a move that proved divisive. Super Meat Boy 3D gives you back control and adds more dynamic gameplay, and I had a blast playing it at Gamescom 2025 in an early Super Meat Boy 3D preview.</p>



<p>Everything you play Super Meat Boy for is here: Trap-filled levels, instant restarts, and an embarrassingly high death counter. The foundation of the game remains the same, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-meatboy-3d-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>‘s new perspective is a total shift. The game maintains a constant 45-degree side angle, and Sluggerfly and Team Meat have devised a new way to create chaos, which ironically puts things into perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-deadly-good-time">A Deadly Good Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beat the game without dying, I dare you. Credit to Head Up Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>My experience of the original <a href="https://sluggerfly.com/smb3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Super Meat Boy</a> and other difficult platformers lulled me into a false sense of security early on when I played the demo. I completed the first two or three stages without dying, but I was bracing myself for the inevitable, brutal storm—which arrived very quickly.</p>



<p>More mechanics were introduced, more dangers were thrown at me, and the death count shot up quicker than a person out of bed with a delivery driver at the door. Like I said, it’s still Super Meat Boy. But the 3D element is fascinating and genuinely creates a whole new way to play the game. You can run around obstacles, and you need to be more precise than ever.</p>



<p>There’s also more happening on screen. Where the original would generally throw individual dangers at you, SMB 3D requires you to survey the area, see which traps are hidden, and plan ahead—all at the same time. You can face several dangers in one passage of time. The platforming itself remains as tight and intricate as ever, and levels require multiple playthroughs to beat (let alone master).</p>



<p>I describe the Super Meat Boy games as a constant learning curve. The difficulty is always scaling. The first few levels were an obvious indicator of this, but whenever I died, I wanted to start over straight away. The controls and setup—from what I played—are the same, and it’s largely a one-button game. The same input allows SMB to jump, wall jump, etc, but the Dash from Super Meat Boy Forever returns!</p>



<p>This simple maneuver gives you a buffer to clear long spaces or help you if you mistime a jump, but it’s also a crucial move required to string together sequences of jumps, falls, dashes (and even more deaths).</p>



<p>3D also brings the world to life in new ways. Aside from the on-screen action, I had fun checking out the extended scenery. It adds more character, quality, and polish to an addictive gameplay loop. Super Meat Boy 3D’s original identity is back, but refreshed in a simple yet effective way. It’s going to be an instant buy from me when it comes out, and I can’t wait to see what other traps and terrors the development team adds to the game before launch.</p>

            <p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has stepped down from his position after over two decades at the studio.</p>
<p>Parsons has been much-criticised by fans and employees alike in recent years, in particular following multiple rounds of layoffs at the studio. In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">public statement</a>, Parsons said he's "decided to pass the torch" - an ironic use of words when Bungie has seemingly been up in flames.</p>
<p>Parsons will be succeeded as CEO by Justin Truman, who's spent 15 years at Bungie across both Destiny games and, more recently, forthcoming live-service shooter Marathon.</p>

<p>"I am deeply proud of the worlds we've built together and the millions of players who call them home - and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie," wrote Parsons in his statement.</p><p>"When I was asked to lead Bungie in 2015, my goal was to grow us into a studio capable of creating and sustaining iconic, generation-spanning entertainment. We've been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live-ops organisation capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment."</p>
<p>Parsons also leaves hundreds of layoffs and negative player sentiment in his wake, not to mention an infamous penchant for classic cars.</p>
<p>Even before Bungie's acquisition by Sony, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-apologies-after-damning-report-exposes-a-culture-of-overt-sexism-at-the-studio">reports emerged in 2021 of workplace toxicity and "overt sexism" at the studio</a>, for which <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/50895">Parsons apologised</a>. "I am not here to refute or to challenge the experiences we're seeing shared today by people who have graced our studio with their time and talent," he said at the time. "Our actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain. I apologise personally and on behalf of everyone at Bungie who I know feels a deep sense of empathy and sadness reading through these accounts."</p>
<p>Then in February 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony acquired Bungie for $3.6bn</a>, ostensibly to assist with its live-service ambitions. Though the acquisition was met with criticism by some - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-opens-probe-into-sonys-acquisition-of-bungie">FTC, for instance, opened an investigation</a> - others were more positive.</p>
<p>In 2024, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-general-counsel-says-sony-forced-the-studio-to-fix-the-things-that-were-wrong-with-their-game">Bungie's former chief in-house lawyer Don McGowan</a> said Sony was "inflicting some discipline" on the studio to "run the game like a business". "To be clear: I'm not talking about the layoffs, I'm talking about forcing them to get their heads out of their asses and focus on things like: implementing a method of new player acquisition; not just doing fan service for the fans in the Bungie C-suite; and running the game like a business," said McGowan.</p><p>However, a year after the acquisition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-warned-employees-of-sharp-drop-in-destiny-2-popularity-prior-to-layoffs">Bungie laid off 100 employees</a> - approximately eight percent of its 1200-strong workforce - after management warned staff revenue for the year was significantly below expectations. Many <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">employees were left anxious about the future of the company</a>, amid claims senior management met employees' sadness at the layoffs with "indifference or even outright flippancy or hostility".</p>
<p>Parsons followed the news with a <a href="https://x.com/pparsons/status/1719083847680459207">statement on social media</a>, calling it a "sad day at Bungie". The statement was heavily criticised as tone deaf and a "slap in the face to anyone impacted by the layoffs".</p>
<p>A year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Bungie laid off a further 220 staff</a>, representing roughly 17 percent of the studio's workforce. Between both rounds, Bungie laid off around a quarter of its workforce in nine months, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-leadership-reportedly-overstated-studios-financial-prospects-to-sony-leading-to-need-for-layoffs">company reportedly overstating its financial prospects to Sony</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">Current and former Bungie employees called that second round of layoffs "inexcusable"</a>, amid calls for Parsons to resign. "Pete is a joke," said former global social media lead Griffin Bennet (who was laid off in the previous cuts), while former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> community manager Liana Ruppert wrote, "Step down, Pete."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">Parsons also faced criticism from staff for spending millions of dollars on classic cars</a> since the studio was acquired by Sony, and bragging about his lavish collection ahead of job losses. The CEO's public profile on Bring a Trailer revealed he'd appeared to spend $2,414,550 on vehicles.</p>

<p>Fans shared a similar sentiment against Parsons. Noted Destiny content creator MyNameIsByf (AKA Lore Daddy) posted on X: "Leadership needs to be changed. Their decisions have consistently led to disaster for everyone who has actually been making the games we play. They've been reckless with the studio, its employees, and its franchises. The problem is clear. Bad leadership. It needs to change."</p>
<p>Now, Parsons is out, leaving Truman in charge. "I have worked alongside Justin for many years," he wrote. "His passion for our games, our team, and our players is unmatched."</p>
<p>Truman himself added to the statement with refreshing honesty, admitting previous mistakes made during Destiny 2's launch. "I've also been part of these efforts at Bungie when we've maybe not been at our best," he wrote. "When we've stumbled and realised through listening to our community that we had missed the mark. I know I've personally learned a lot over the years, as have all of us here, from those conversations."</p><p>He continued: "I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them."</p>
<p>Bungie continues to work on Destiny 2, while its next release will be Marathon. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Marathon gameplay was finally shown back in April</a>, in June <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Bungie delayed the game indefinitely</a> in response to "passionate" fan feedback. Ahead of the decision, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">Bungie staff morale was said to be in "free fall"</a> as it grappled with the fallout over Marathon assets stolen from other artists.</p>
<p>While such endemic toxicity and poor management cannot, of course, be pinpointed to one person, Bungie is clearly at a critical point in its history. Let's hope this shift in CEO will boost morale at the studio ahead of Marathon's eventual release - and whatever is next for Bungie.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"One of the reasons why we brought in a lot of fresh meat--all the new, younger developers--is because, not only did we want to give them a chance to figure out how to create and develop a Metal Gear game, but also give them a chance to experience the game themselves,” Okamura said to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/metal-gear-solid-producers-training-new-devs-continue-series-1235410797/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>. "And we’ll still be here for a while, but right now the goal is to build a team that could carry on the legacy on our behalf and could produce, hopefully in the future, more exciting games."</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is designed to be a bridge for that idea, as Okamura and Korekado view it as having the potential to reenergize the franchise and draw in new creators. Korekado explained that the seasoned developers working on the game were able to incorporate feedback from younger members on the team that would help modernize the game, while still retaining the original elements that made this entry in the series so captivating when it was first released in the 2000s.</p><p>The future of Metal Gear Solid is also one that will likely not involve series creator Hideo Kojima, as following his exit from Konami, the industry legend has been busy with multiple projects at his studio, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/">Death Stranding and its sequel</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6533769/">OD</a>, and a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Solid, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/">Phsyint</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-his-new-game-is-now-in-crunch-time-wonders-how-much-longer-he-can-stay-creative/1100-6528760/">Kojima has also spoken</a> about how all the demanding work of creating a video game has begun to take a mental and physical toll on him as he grows older, but he still plans to remain as creative for as long as possible--or at least until he becomes the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-to-be-the-first-person-to-make-a-game-in-space/1100-6532868/">first person to make a game in space</a>. He's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">not planning to play Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 28, and we gave it a 9/10 in our review. "Konami's Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is a safe but successful modernization of a beloved classic," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review</a>.</p>

                <p>2017's Hollow Knight just reached a new all-time peak concurrent-player record on Steam, and the achievement came just after developer Team Cherry announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/" data-ref-id="1100-6534159">release date for its sequel, Silksong.</a></p><p>Hollow Knight reached an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all-time peak concurrent record of 23,819 on Steam today, August 22</a>. Measuring a game's popularity by Steam concurrent numbers is never a perfect or complete encapsulation of a game's popularity, and Hollow Knight being an exclusively single-player game that doesn't rely on people playing at the same time muddies the waters as well. But what is evident here is that Hollow Knight's popularity on Steam is growing in the wake of the big Silksong reveal.</p>

                <p>In the menagerie of 1990s animal video game mascots, Bubsy might rank somewhere between Aero the Acrobat and Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures (the latter having a small resurgence last year with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/rocket-knight-re-sparked-collection-pre-order-trailer/2300-6464045/" data-ref-id="2300-6464045">rerelease of the Sega Genesis games</a>). Now it's Bubsy's turn to get a new spin for a new decade in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bubsy-returns-in-a-new-3d-platformer-this-is-not-a-joke/1100-6534082/" data-ref-id="1100-6534082">Bubsy 4D</a>, and it actually looks good.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fabraz.bsky.social/post/3lwwc5ndsvk2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, the developer Fabraz showed off more of the game's mechanics, switching Bubsy back and forth from his hairball form, dashing through obstacles, then back to regular form, climbing and clawing his way over walls and other nefarious traps. The cel-shaded colors pop and set it apart from the other games in the franchise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4bq6P8e5gk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H4bq6P8e5gk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The wise-cracking bobcat is returning to his platforming roots after 2019's auto-runner, Bubsy: Paws on Fire, but this time he's not taking on the Woolies but an army of sheep robots: The BaaBots. Bubsy 4D also includes a customizable wardrobe, including the Bubsy 3D skin.</p><p>So it appears they've cranked up Bubsy's speed a bit, seemingly giving it a more Sonic Frontiers feel. "The team at Fabraz crafted this expressive new moveset to cater to beginners and speedrun enthusiasts alike," the official release says. "Once you've mastered Bubsy’s clawsome new moves, show off your skills by uploading your best level times to the online leaderboards for other players to race against!"</p><p>There's no official release date yet, but you can wishlist it now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and it will be available on every major platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>What do Hollow Knight Silksong and Grand Theft Auto VI have in common? Enough popularity to make other studios delay their games to get out of the way, and hopefully not be drowned out by the hype of either. Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Team Cherry finally announced a release date</a> for Silksong, which will launch on September 4, 2025. Today, developers Aeternum Game Studios and Panik Arcade delayed their games to get the hell out of its way.</p>



<p>Both studios cite Hollow Knight Silksong's release date as a reason for their delay, though in fairness the situations for Aeternum and Panik are not exactly one-to-one. In the case of Panik Arcade and its slot machine roguelike <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">CloverPit</a>, that takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, is only being delayed by a few weeks, from its initial September 3 release date to September 26.</p>



<p>The studio announced the delay with a <a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, and added in a press release, "<em>We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol</em>. <em>We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy Silksong, so we’re launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish CloverPit even further</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨GAME DELAY 🚨</p><p>due to Silksong (can’t wait to play) launching just a day after CloverPit, we decided to delay our release</p><p>our new release date is 26th Sept</p><p>we poured our hearts into our little game, so we want to give it the best possible shot. thanks for understanding!! <a href="https://t.co/QwKwBrBuFJ">pic.twitter.com/QwKwBrBuFJ</a></p></div>— Panik Arcade 🕹️ making CloverPit 🍒🎰 (@PanikArcade) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>At least in CloverPit's case, Panik Arcade is just trying to ensure that it can grab some attention when it launches, especially since it's a very different game compared to Silksong, and isn't trying to stand its ground as a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>Which is the problem that Aeternum Game Studios is dealing with. Its upcoming game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/">Aeterna Lucis</a>, is a sequel to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517970/Aeterna_Noctis/">2021's Aeterna Noctis</a> and a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>"<em>Our initial plan was to launch it this September,</em>" Aeternum Game Studios writes in a <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>But after the announcement of Silksong, we are fully aware that our game wouldn't have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team's effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, Aeterna Lucis won't arrive until sometime in 2026. Though Aeternum Game Studios isn't just pinning the blame on Hollow Knight Silksong. It needs more than just a few weeks of delay time because it doesn't have "<em>all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you Aeterna Lucis at the right time. That's why we've made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio doesn't specify which of the next-generation platforms it is struggling to obtain development kits for, but the obvious guess is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as we've seen several reports about smaller studios having issues getting dev kits from Nintendo, with only the larger studios and publishers getting priority.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Aeternum Game Studios goes on to thank Team Cherry, crediting the studio and Hollow Knight as a key reason for 2D Metroidvania games being as popular as they are in the modern gaming landscape. The studio also acknowledges Team Cherry's work as a key inspiration for Aeterna Noctis and Aeterna Lucis.</p>



<p>At least in the case of Grand Theft Auto VI's release date, studios have more time to plan to get out of Rockstar and Take-Two's path, since you can bet that GTA VI will hog <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/">every bit of the videogame industry's attention</a> when it arrives in May 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-2-2-set-for-september-release.1278279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2 will be arriving in early September, bringing with it new Agents for your squad, a new story chunk to uncover, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-21-release-date" rel="nofollow">July's Version 2.1 update</a>, Version 2.2 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>&nbsp;is launching on September 4th (which, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, is a pretty daring release date to commit to on HoYoverse's part, it must be said).</p>

<p>Story-wise, you'll be dealing with the fallout of the Exaltists' conspiracy and getting to know the Obol Squad, a new elite unit alongside whom you'll be working in order to "uncover long-buried truths", as well as to reveal the hidden stories behind one of its members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=roa5RDDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=xlZ7I-ZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2.</figcaption></figure><p>That agent is Seed, and you'll be getting the chance to add her to your team in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2. She's a genius mechanic and Electric Attack Agent who can enhance sustained damage across her whole team.</p>

<p>Joining Seed is the twofer unit Orphie &amp; Magus, a Fire Attack Agent who can boost team Attack and cause Aftershocks to ignore part of your enemy's Defense stat. They're joined by S-rank Bangboo Mercury, who can serve as a tank for their team.</p>

<p>Alongside Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus, you'll also get another chance to pick up Evelyn and Trigger throughout the course of Version 2.2's cycle, and Soldier 0 - Anby, who's "currently undergoing intensive training", will be returning "in future versions" as well.</p>

<p>Of course, Version 2.2 will also bring with it plenty of new events and gameplay improvements, so once you've played through the main part of the new update's story, there should still be plenty for you to do.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to check out right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices. Version 2.2, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", launches on September 4th.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> began life as a DLC expansion, but then developers Team Cherry decided the concept was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-developers-announce-a-full-sequel-silksong">"too large and too unique</a>", and upgraded it into a full game. They spent six years working on the thing in almost total silence, while fulminating legions of the terminally online quietly drove themselves bonkers hunting for release date clues. We now have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-a-release-date-and-youve-only-got-to-wait-a-little-bit-skonger">Silksong release date</a> - it's just two weeks away - so in theory, the nightmare is over. Except, oh dear - Team Cherry are planning post-launch content for Silksong, and they're already calling it "ambitious".

All that's from this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">breakout interview</a> with Press X To Jason Schreier, the person who considerately does all the investigative reporting in games journalism so that humbler souls like myself can spend our days taking the piss out of him. According to Schreier, "they're already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come." Then there are some snippets from Team Cherry's founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," Pellen said. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."
</p>
<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," interjected Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p><p>
Those monsters! I look forward to revisiting this post in 2030, assuming RPS hasn't been turned into sausages by then, while writing up the latest rumours about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>: Polyestertune or Satinmelody or whatever they end up calling the third one. In fairness, Hollow Knight did get actual DLC expansions before Silksong that launched at a regular rate.
</p>
<p>
In any case, the DLC tease is perhaps better interpreted as show of kindness. Earlier in the interview, Gibson and Pellen fret that by actually releasing Silksong, they're spoiling things for players for whom the real Silksong is speculating endlessly about the release of Silksong.</p>
<p>"It's nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they've obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it," said Gibson, diplomatically. Added Pellen: "Feels like we're going to ruin their fun by releasing the game." I guess their tantalising talk of "ambitious" post-launch material is a bid to keep the dream alive, then.

              <p>And…there we go! It’s officially Friday, folks. I’m filling in for Ethan, who <em>should</em> have written today’s edition, so if you prefer his take on Morning Checkpoint, well, sorry, you have to deal with me. This morning, we learn about Double Fine’s future, get ready to watch a weird <em>Fortnite</em> stream, check out what’s up with <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign, and catalog the first game to run away from <em>Silksong</em>‘s September launch. Oh and here’s a trailer for a movie that looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/9oJEUcpPeBw"><em>Jaws</em>, but set during the Second World War. Enjoy</a>?</p> <h2>Aeterna Lucis is delaying its launch to avoid <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p>Yesterday, after many years of waiting, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">we finally got a release date for <em>Silksong.</em></a> It’s arriving next month, and one game is already throwing in the towel and delaying its launch to avoid the indie superstar sequel. On Friday, the devs behind <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> announced that the game was being pushed back from a planned September launch to sometime in 2026, partly because of <em>Silksong</em> and partly because they lack all the dev kits needed for a release on “next-gen” platforms.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CUomiRcsZU">pic.twitter.com/CUomiRcsZU</a></p> <p>— Aeternum Game Studios (@aeternathegame) <a href="https://twitter.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Our initial plan was to launch<em> [Aeterna Lucis]</em> this September,” said the devs in a statement. “But after the announcement of <em>Silksong</em>, we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.”</p>

 <h2>Double Fine isn’t working on <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or any other sequels</h2> <p><em>Keeper</em>, Double Fine’s next game, looks great! It comes after a big gap following the company’s last game, <em>Psychonauts 2</em>. If you’re worried that, after&nbsp;<em>Keeper</em>‘s release, you’ll be waiting a while again for more Double Fine goodness, take heart: the studio’s founder and boss, Tim Schafer, says that Double Fine is working on multiple projects at the moment. But, if you were hoping for a <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or <em>Psychonauts 3</em>, well, I’m sorry to say that ain’t happening anytime soon.</p> <p>“I’m working on other stuff,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-tim-schafer-rules-out-more-sequels-for-now-so-you-can-forget-about-brtal-legend-2-and-psychonauts-3">Schafer told <em>IGN</em></a>. “The studio is doing multiple projects right now and they’re all original IPs, because we did <em>Psychonauts 2</em> and that will hold us for sequels for a while.”</p> <h2>The alleged mother of one of Elon Musk’s kids will be on a <em>Fortnite</em> stream</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">💥 Fortnite Friday is BACK 💥</p> <p>🚨 Alleged Mother of Elon Musk's Child… Ashley St. Clair (<a href="https://twitter.com/stclairashley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stclairashley</a>) gives her FIRST live interview since news broke… straight from the Battle Bus 🚨</p> <p>🇺🇸 5PM PST / 8PM EST 🇺🇸 <a href="https://t.co/WFBXsFMblL">pic.twitter.com/WFBXsFMblL</a></p> <p>— connor (@ConnorEatsPants) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1958612410774040833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I don’t have much to add to this other than that we live in a very strange world.</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em> is ditching campaign difficulty levels</h2> <p>The latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is making some big changes to the series’ handling of campaigns. <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s will support co-op, and there will be a rogue-like endgame included with it. Another big change? <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t feature the franchise’s usual difficulty levels, like Veteran or Hardened. Instead, as developers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why">Treyarch explained to <em>IGN</em>,</a> the studio is using co-op to balance the game. The more players you include in the action, the harder things get. It’s an interesting change, though I wonder how more casual players hopping in to play with a friend might handle getting their ass kicked over and over again and having no way to make things easier.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-halo-destiny-2-sony-2000619244">After 23 years, Bungie boss Pete Parsons is leaving</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-ftl-2000619136">This new<em> Star Trek Voyager</em> game seems cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-brennan-lee-mulligan-date-2000619230">Critical Role’s big shake-up, explained</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Star Wars Control Panels Were Made for Filming!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UykDcJEojc4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

                <p dir="ltr">NBA 2K26 is just a week out from launch for those who preorder or purchase the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k26-preorders-editions-bonuses-and-early-access/1100-6533141/">early-launch editions</a>. When it gets here, players should expect to find that what was once the community's biggest complaint has been scrubbed out of the game, according to its gameplay lead. Earlier this week, gameplay director Mike Wang told me in a chat from NBA 2K Community Day in San Francisco that 2K26 was designed from "day one" to eliminate what players most often found had plagued the game: "RNG"--short for random number generation--or what often felt like randomized outcomes.</p><p dir="ltr">The community, Wang told me, "felt like they didn't have control over the outcomes of the shot or whatever it was on the court. That's the biggest thing we addressed. Like, from day one, one of the points of emphasis was to make sure that [for] everything in the game, there's a skill aspect to it, or it's completely driven by skill, so that the gamer had the ability to dictate whether they did something right or wrong.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554172-screenshot2025-08-21114314.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554172" data-ratio="0.55962343096234" data-width="956" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554172-screenshot2025-08-21114314.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554172"></a><figcaption>SGA follows his nearly perfect season by being on the cover of NBA 2K26.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554172-screenshot2025-08-21114314.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That's probably most felt in shooting. Shooting is such a touchy subject. We're doing green-or-miss [mechanics] again," he explained, describing the way a perfectly timed shot will <em>always</em> go in, while a shot that misses the on-screen green timing window never will. This mechanic frustrated some players in 2K24, leading to the team creating different difficulty, or "shot timing" profiles for players to choose at will in last year's game, but this created its own set of issues by pitting players with different profiles against one another.</p><p dir="ltr">"So, the scary thing about that, obviously, is that people who are really, really good at timing a button can be unstoppable like Steph Curry. So we're trying to balance that with a stronger contest system, and it's in a good spot now [...] There are people who mastered <em>this </em>frame of <em>this </em>jump shot" but savvy defenders can now better "hold them in check if you play your defense and just play basketball."</p><p dir="ltr">He added that the team learned a lot from past mistakes and explained how this year's game aims to conclude a three-year debate over shooting gameplay by applying last year's shot-timing profiles to specific modes and difficulties, evening the playing field on the basis of mode and difficulty level. "And [the idea in 2K25 was], 'Okay, if you're not into the timing [element], you can set this profile to be this lower-skilled one.' So we've taken that concept, and basically, that's what Rookie and Semi-Pro and Pro [difficulties and their related modes] feel like. It's like, you could be a little sloppy with your timing, but still play the game and have fun. Then, when you move up in the difficulty to the higher ones, those feel more like, 'Okay, if I don't really master my shots or learn my players, then I'm gonna miss shots.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554171-screenshot2025-08-21114330.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554171" data-ratio="0.55775234131113" data-width="961" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554171-screenshot2025-08-21114330.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554171"></a><figcaption>In addition to the game's WNBA mode, women will now be playable in MyTeam, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4554171-screenshot2025-08-21114330.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The debate over NBA 2K shot mechanics and green timing windows has raged for years now, and from the outside looking in, the process seems dizzying. I asked Wang what it's like trying to appease every corner of the game's massive audience, with differing and sometimes mutually exclusive ideas on how shooting ought to behave.</p><p dir="ltr">With a (perhaps only half-joking) fatigued exhale, he told me, "It's really hard." Like in recent years, the debate over shooting mechanics will come down to the data. Those are really only visible once millions of people are playing it at once and the series' analytics-obsessed community starts to pick it apart. That process begins next week, when NBA 2K26 launches for early-edition players on August 29.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Silksong is the most anticipated and wishlisted game on all of Steam and we think people will love this game and play it right at launch (including us) but that also means it will overshadow all games launching close to it. So if we stick to our original date we would risk the launch of CloverPit a fair bit," the developers said.</p><p>The team said it wants to give CloverPit the best chance at succeeding, so it decided to delay the release by a few weeks. The studio will spend the extra time working to "polish the game even further."</p><p>Another release pushed back due to Silksong is the 1.0 launch for Faeland, an adventure RPG inspired by 8-bit games of yesteryear. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1280080/view/496078660487348547?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developers said</a>, "We've made the tough call to postpone" the 1.0 release of Faeland, which is currently available in Steam Early Access. The 1.0 launch was previously set for September 9.</p><p>"This wasn't an easy decision. We poured years of work and love into Faeland, and we want to make sure it arrives at a time when it can receive the attention and care it deserves," the studio said. A new release date will be announced "very soon."</p><p>Aeternum Game Studios, meanwhile, announced that Aeterna Lucis--previously set to launch in September--is now delayed to 2026. "After the announcement of Silksong, we are fully aware that our game wouldn't have the visibility it deserves," the developer <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team's effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions."</p><p>It wasn't just Silksong's release date prompting the delay, however, as the studio said, "We still don't have all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms."</p><p>Aeterna Lucis is finished, the studio said, and the extra development time will be used for more polish and refinement. </p><p>"We also wanted to take this opportunity to thank Team Cherry. There's no need to wish them luck--we know Silksong will be a success and a masterpiece," the developer said. "Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the metroidvania genre is more alive than ever and, in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create Aeterna Noctis and the entire saga now in development." </p><p>A sequel to 2017's Hollow Knight, Silksong was originally designed to be an expansion to Hollow Knight before developer Team Cherry repositioned it as a full standalone game. The wait for any real news about Silksong led some to believe it might have been in development hell, but the developers said this was not true and that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">enormous success of Hollow Knight afforded them the opportunity to take their time with Silksong. </a></p><p>Silksong is playable at Gamescom this week, and there are long lines snaking through the convention center for a chance to play the highly anticipated game.</p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p><p>When GTA 6 was still scheduled for 2025, many believed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-prompt-major-studios-to-delay-games-report/1100-6530346/" data-ref-id="1100-6530346">other developers might shift release dates to avoid it</a>. With GTA 6 being delayed to 2026, it looks like Silksong is taking its place as a 2025 game that's prompting others to move around it.</p>

New booster packs are being released regularly for the mobile game, ensuring a steady stream of content.

<p>
The Pokémon Company recently made a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-finally-receives-much-needed-trading-overhaul">much-needed overhaul to trading in the game</a>, removing the need for an extra currency.

Let's hope this new booster pack doesn't accidentally include any fan art - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-developer-apologises-deeply-after-players-discover-key-artwork-for-its-new-set-was-based-on-fan-drawing">company was forced to apologise</a> when "incorrect reference materials" were used for cards in the previous booster pack.

<p>The 'Secluded Springs' expansion is another Gen II-focused set, with legendaries Raikou, Entei, and Suicune taking centre stage. A bunch of other Johto and Hoenn 'mon will be tagging along for the ride, and the new teaser trailer showcases some sweet full-arts for the likes of Milotic and our beloved Phanpy.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at a handful of the cards shown in the trailer:</p>


<p>It feels like just yesterday that we first set eyes on the Ho-Oh and Lugia Wisdom of Sea and Sky set, and our Pack Hourglasses are still flagging because of it. As a reminder, the last set came bundled with a sizeable slice of drama after TPC was hit with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pocket-updates-card-art-following-plagiarism-allegations">plagiarism accusations</a> following the release of the two central legendary full-art cards. TPC quickly released a statement in which it "deeply apologize[d]" for the error, pulled the card art in question, and replaced it a week later.</p>
<p>In other TCG Pocket news, TPC closed out this year's World Championships with a tease that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-expansion-introduces-a-mega-mix-up">Mega Evolutions</a> will be coming to the app at some point "this fall".</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed-after-sequel-returns-to-beta.1278234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that peer-to-peer support is coming to&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, allowing you to continue playing the game online even after the central servers are shut down.</p>

<p>Back in July, 1047 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that in order to focus on rebuilding&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>(which is returning to beta following negative feedback for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">initial release</a>), servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be closed down, but at the time, the devs said they would consider either offline play or peer-to-peer support.</p>

<p>Now, in a news post on the official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>website, 1047 confirms that the direction it's chosen to go down is peer-to-peer play, which means you'll still be able to play with others online, although you'll do so via direct connection and not through a central server.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=HlgMDqex 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=gOsRvXZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, fear not; it'll still be playable after next week.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing peer-to-peer play, 1047 says it's made "previously unreleased, stockpiled, or work-in-progress" content for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>playable, including 14 new maps for you to gallivant around.</p>

<p>In essence, peer-to-peer play means that certain players will act as hosts, so the stability of the game will depend on how strong their connection is. You'll be able to view in-progress&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>games from the server browser.</p>

<p>You'll also be granted all in-game cosmetics to enjoy, and all of your previous progression will remain intact as well, so everything you've unlocked over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will still be accessible.</p>

<p>PC and console play will still be supported, as will cross-play, so you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>alongside players on other platforms. Anticheat, however, will not be enabled, so there's a chance you may come across more nefarious behavior than before.</p>




<p>You can read the full FAQ for how peer-to-peer play will work in&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>via the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, and you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/splitgate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate/9P4S1BPJLPHZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta is officially a Thing That Happened, and now comes the terrible ordeal of Learning From The Experience. Here is what developers DICE, Criterion, Motive and Ripple Effect have learned from the experience: you are all playing the game far too much like Call Of Duty. Goodness me, it's like 2007 never ended.</p>
<p>Doing headshots in midair? That's an updatin'. Doing a parkour while carrying a light machinegun? That's an updatin'. Bunny-hopping with prejudice? You'd best believe that's an updatin'. Never mind that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">those multiplayer reveal montages</a> emphasised footloose quickdraw almost as much as they incited a murderous contempt for helicopters. It's time to play Battlefield the way Battlefield should be played: lying in a hole praying that one of your team-mates spawns on you before a tank rolls over your head.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
This, at least, is my addled Friday afternoon summary of EA's just-announced post-beta plans, via <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">Mecha-Hitler.com</a>. Let's squeeze into our thinking caps and break it all down.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the developers are doing a "general pass on recoil and tap-fire characteristics across all weapons", to make them feel more unique, especially in terms of range. They're also making changes to encourage more controlled tap and burst-firing. In particular, the M87A1 shotgun has been defanged, and they're "investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences", with news of changes to follow.
</p><p>
As for movement, they want it to feel more "balanced and traditional" in the final version of Battlefield 6. There will be less carry-over of momentum and particularly horizontal speed from a slide to a jump. Jump height will also be lowered during consecutive jumps, and you'll be less accurate while jumping or sliding.</p>
<p>"These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable," the devs comment. You won't get as much acceleration when opening a parachute, either, "for more controlled aerial movement". I hate being in control of my aerial movement. In practice, it just makes it easier for people on the ground to shoot me.
</p>
<p>
The game's smaller maps are being tweaked to stop naughty people getting onto rooftops and venturing out of bounds. "This gameplay is not intended for these maps, and the upcoming ladder for the Assault class is also not designed to access these areas," the devs sternly explain. Bad ladder! Down!</p>
<p>They'll be testing two more maps in Battlefield Labs before release, a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>'s Operation Firestorm and another map set in Mirak Valley, both of which offer "the full complement of vehicles" and "a more vast combat space". Vaster, EA, vaster! How am I supposed to trust you to fine-tune parachute physics when you can't even optimise your sentences. Yes, I realise I have just held up a red cape to all the amateur copyeditors in the comments.
</p><p>
Modes? Well, they've found that Rush gets a bit smeary when there are too many players involved. Apparently, "when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible", presumably because the attacking player's head and torso also become less tangible. As such, they're lowering the player count for Rush "to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode". 
</p>
<p>
Anticipating pushback on this front, the post points out that people can mess with the count as they please when playing Rush via the Portal editor. Breakthrough, meanwhile, will receive "map-by-map balance adjustments towards our goal of 50/50 win ratio for both Attackers and Defenders".
</p>
<p>
In general, EA are taking an ad hoc approach to player counts based on the individual map and mode. "For example, at launch, some Breakthrough layouts will support 48 players, while others will have 64," the post comments. "It's the one of many factors we adjust to create the right balance and feel for each scenario. In Breakthrough higher player counts work well on open, dynamic maps, while smaller player-groups offer a more focused experience on denser maps." They've found that "8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and [King of the Hill]". Again, you can jimmy the workings in Portal if you wish.
</p>
<p>
Some final bits: open and closed weapon playlists will continue to be available in Battlefield 6, "and we are looking for ways to keep them easily accessible". I'm not sure why that would be difficult? They're also trying to fix matchmaking so that you won't have too much difficulty finding games in which to complete the Challenge of capturing sectors in Breakthrough or Rush.
</p><p>
Expect some of these improvements to materialise in forthcoming Battlefield Labs playtests. The game launches on 10th October. Our hardware editor James attended a preview event recently and came away with the verdict that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">"looks like a Battlefield game"</a>, thereby demonstrating the granular insight that got him promoted to CPU Wrangler First Class.</p>
<p>Even more granularistically, James noted that "there are also reasons to be optimistic that this is a series getting itself back on track, from its renewed emphasis on breaking shit to the replacement of show-off specialists with that old unspoken rule of 'Stick with your squad or perish.'" Did you play the beta? How did you find it?

              <p><span>After almost 30 years of monster catching and battling, there are dozens of unsolved mysteries in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-balls-monster-catchin-musical-professor-oak-2000617768"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>universe. One that has literally haunted fans for over a decade now is the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-knows-what-the-deal-is-with-the-ghost-girl-in-po-1458254184"><span>“Ghost Girl”</span></a><span> who appears in the 3DS games </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. This mysterious Hex Maniac character shows up in Lumiose City, says some ominous stuff to the player, and slides off-screen without an actual walking animation. This odd occurrence has never been explained, and when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/almost-a-year-later-pokemon-x-ys-ghost-girl-is-still-1646738916"><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>asked</span></a> <i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>producer Junichi Masuda about it back in 2014, he was playfully evasive.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game.1278225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first chances to get hands-on with the second installment in the Hell Let Loose series, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose has always been one of my go-to World War 2 games since it released in early access in 2019 following its successful Kickstarter campaign (which I backed!). Its huge scale, impressive visuals, and its high-stakes one-shot kill gameplay have made the game one of the most immersive World War 2 multiplayer games that I don’t think anyone has been able to match.</p>



<p>So when the publisher behind Hell Let Loose, Team 17, announced that there was going to be a new installment in the series, but this time set in Vietnam, I had to jump on the chance to get some hands-on.</p>



<h2 id="h-familiar-but-entirely-different">Familiar, But Entirely Different</h2>



<p>To start the match, I made my way to the action as a gunner in a helicopter, ready to rain down bullets on any Vietnamese fighters we came across. After a short one-minute flight over the rivers and the jungle, we landed at our objective on a swampy riverbank.</p>



<p>Almost instantly, enemy mortar fire started to rain down on our location as we made our way to our objective, which was a Vietnamese village already crawling with enemy soldiers. Bamboo bridges provided fast but risky navigation from building to building, and we were under attack from green tracer rounds, suppressing our position from the jungle tree line.</p>



<p>After a couple of minutes of taking down a few enemies, we secured the objective and made our way to the next one, which meant crossing a large river. For those familiar with Hell Let Loose, you know that this would often provide a challenge of trying to find an uncontested bridge or a canal boat pile-up to get across, but in Hell Let Loose Vietnam, we were able to swim across. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, our squad’s time was short-lived as we were all killed, but the moment made for one of those classic Hell Let Loose cinematic moments that never get old, as the treeline facing us was suppressed by an artillery strike. Sadly, it didn’t hit the enemy that lit up our squad with an AK-47, but hey, what can you do?</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-massive-improvements-across-the-board">Massive Improvements Across The Board</h2>



<p>For those who adore Hell Let Loose, this game feels really familiar, with plenty of improvements across the board that I hope will bleed over into the original game. But importantly, the game feels refreshing in the grand scheme of things. The developers have managed to maintain that immersive feeling that Hell Let Loose is known for, all while making sure the game feels different enough that it warrants an entirely new title.</p>



<p>One of the biggest concerns I had when I heard about the series heading into Vietnam was the lack of enemy visibility, which sometimes is a problem in the first game. However, the improved lighting overhaul, coupled with the game’s upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, has seemingly made a massive difference to the game’s overall colour palette. While you’re certainly going to be shot from weird places from time to time, those concerns are now firmly squashed. The audio has also made a tremendous difference in the game, enabling players to rely on both their ears and eyes to pinpoint enemy locations.</p>



<p>Another concern was around the game’s performance, too. Hell Let Loose has been notorious for not having the best performance on some of its maps; however, on the map that we played, I’m pleased to say that I had zero performance issues. Granted, the PC that I was playing on probably had top-of-the-line specs, but I was also keeping an eye on a developer’s screen during the playtest, who was playing on a laptop, where the FPS counter didn’t drop below 100. So, at face value from the test, it appears a lot of effort has been put into making sure the game is as stable as possible.</p>



<p>Overall, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam currently has a vague release date of 2026 for the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

A title that means the world to us and represents the greatest effort of the entire Aeternum Game Studios team.</p><p>Our initial plan was to launch it this September, but after the announcement of [<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>], we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</p><p>In addition, we still don’t have all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms. To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>That’s why we’ve made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</p><p>The game is already finished, and we will use this additional time to keep polishing it, refining every detail, and making sure it delivers the perfect experience our community deserves. We know this change disrupts many of our strategies, but we are confident that with your support we can overcome this major challenge.</p><p>We also want to take this opportunity to thank <a title="Companies > Team Cherry [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/team-cherry">Team Cherry</a>. There’s no need to wish them luck-we know <em>Silksong</em> will be a success and a masterpiece. Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> genre is more alive than ever and, in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> and the entire saga now in development.</p><p>Thank you for walking this journey with us. 2026 will be a special year, and we can’t wait to live it alongside all of you.</p><p>With all our love,<br>The Aeternum Game Studios Team</p></blockquote><p><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [14,152 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,574 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and now presumably, Switch 2.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/aeterna-lucis-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Development on Keeper is being led by Double Fine's Lee Petty, and this allowed Schafer to focus his efforts on these new projects. That doesn't mean that we'll <em>never </em>see a Psychonauts threequel--after all, the game between the first and second games was 16 years--or another Brutal Legend game, but for now, the developer is interested in creating brand-new games instead. Back in June, Schafer also commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psychonauts-3-isnt-in-development-right-now-double-fine-confirms/1100-6515614/">how he was developing new games instead of Psychonauts 3</a>.</p><p>While Brutal Legend 2 looks unlikely for now, the game did experience a surge in activity recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/double-fine-paid-tribute-to-ozzy-osbourne-by-giving-away-brutal-legend-for-666-minutes/1100-6533408/">as Double Fine gave the game away for a devilish 666 minutes</a> to honor the passing of the Guardian of Metal, Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne.</p><p>Double Fine's Keeper will launch on October 17 for PC and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/keeper-official-announce-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025/2300-6466106/">and in case you missed the reveal trailer</a>, the game revolves around a a long-forgotten lighthouse and a plucky seabird embarking on a grand adventure.</p>
