      <div><p>Free League Publishing launched its Kickstarter campaign for <em>Alien RPG Evolved Edition</em> today. The campaign for the updated version of their officially licensed Alien TTRPG reached its initial funding goal within 15 minutes of it going live.</p>



<p>According to its Kickstarter page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/alien-rpg-second-edition-and-rapture-protocol/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Alien RPG Evolved Edition</em></a> contains an updated core rulebook, a new starter set, a cinematic adventure boxed set, and a set of miniatures.</p>

The book will feature new items, spaceships, and locations from the recent feature film <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. In addition, it will contain improved and streamlined stealth mechanics, a solo mode, stress and panic rules, and even zero-gravity rules.</p>

<p>For aspiring collectors and early backers, the campaign has some extras. If you back the campaign within 48 hours, you will receive a crew patch of the USCSS Fidanza, the spaceship featured in the cinematic adventure <em>Rapture Protocol</em>, at no additional cost.Finally, there is a Kickstarter-exclusive Collectors Edition of the Core Rulebook.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> is, for the most part, a pretty unexceptional game that does most things pretty competently, though it does manage to slip into that coveted 7/10, imperfect but has something special about it to keep you thinking about it. I'm talking about its Nemesis system, a mechanic that means certain enemies you face off against remember you and your actions as they get stronger, maybe even calling out certain occasions where they killed you. It's a lovely bit of design that, as it turns out, kind of just exists to stop the second hand game market.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
How so? Well, former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/warner-bros">Warner Bros</a> Games exec Laura Fryer recently explained as such in a recent YouTube video of hers. According to Fryer, while working with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/monolith-productions">Monolith</a> she explained to them that a problem <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rocksteady-studios">Rocksteady's</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> faced in terms of sales was that people were buying the game, playing it, returning it, which would then of course be sold second hand. This meant Rocksteady, and subsequently Warner Bros., weren't getting as much money as they'd like.

<p>
"They were only getting paid for the first copy sold," Fryer explained. "They lost millions of dollars." Sure, multiplayer games were growing in popularity at the time, but as Fryer put it, "How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever?"
</p>
<p>
She went on to explain that Monolith's game engine couldn't really do a big open world like GTA, and they apparently weren't interested in multiplayer. So, they needed a hook. "And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory."
</p>
<p>
The Nemesis system is a great one, I put hours into Shadow of Mordor because of it despite not being all that much of a Lord of the Rings fan, but frustratingly it is patented until 2036, so you won't be seeing it in any other game any time soon. Especially because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">Warner Bros. closed Monolith last month</a>, cancelling its Wonder Woman game (which was set to feature the system) along with it. What a load of rubbish, if you ask me.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cd-projekt-red-hires-50-new-devs-to-work-on-witcher-4-and-other-projects.1144542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-hires-50-new-devs-to-work-on-witcher-4-and-other-projects/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Over the past four months, Polish game developer CD Projekt Red has hired over 50 new employees to work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-wont-let-the-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and other titles. The new entry in the iconic Witcher series is the only project currently in production, but CDPR has boosted the working numbers of almost all its other project departments.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdpr-has-been-increasing-the-size-of-almost-all-its-project-teams">CDPR Has Been Increasing the Size of Almost All its Project Teams</h2>



<p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/03/cd-projekt-group-presentation-fy-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its earnings statement for the 2024 fiscal year today, highlighting the continuing success of Cyberpunk 2077 and the excitement built around The Witcher 4’s announcement. CDPR states that The Witcher 4 had the most watched trailer from The Game Awards’ slate of game premieres and had the most press coverage (measured in total article appearances and headlines).</p>



<p>Between the end of November (just a couple weeks before The Game Awards) and the end of this past February, CDPR brought on 57 new employees. 11 of those employees joined the already massive team working on The Witcher 4, increasing the total number to 411.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>However, the project that got the largest increase to its total size is the team working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-project-orion-2077-warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orion, the codename for Cyberpunk sequel</a> project. Over the last four months, that team increased by 20, growing from 64 to 84 employees. Prior to the start of this hiring wave, CDPR says they reached 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077 sold, and over 8 million copies sold of the critically acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>



<p>Fans shouldn’t expect the Cyberpunk sequel, or realistically any major CDPR release, anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is still in production, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-witcher-multiplayer-game-has-development-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the multiplayer Witcher project known as Sirius</a> is still in pre-production, and the Witcher remake, the Cyberpunk sequel, and a new IP project codenamed Hadar are still in their concept phases. There are also some unannounced projects in the works, including one from Fool’s Theory, who are also working on the Witcher remake.</p>

<p>Moonshot Games, a studio under Dreamhaven, has revealed its brand new online multiplayer shooter Wildgate. Set to launch on Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and PC later this year, Wildgate is a PvPvE crew-based first-person shooter that sees players travel into a vast area of space with the goal of capturing an ancient relic known as the Artifact.</p>



<p>The game features 20 player matches with five teams of four. Each team enters an area of space known as The Reach with a mission to capture the Artifact and make it through the Wildgate itself.</p>



<h6 id="h-preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year">PREVIEW: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildgate Could Be The Multiplayer Game Of The Year</a></h6>



<p>Every match can take anywhere from 20 to 40-plus minutes to complete as you explore and fight through a map that features procedurally placed elements. You choose one of five available prospectors—each having different abilities and tools at their disposal—and board one of five ships that also have different specializations. From there, how you play is up to you and your crew. You can choose to look for the Artifact quickly and escape or build up your ship to destroy those also looking for the rare relic. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ships can be upgraded throughout the match with new weapons, shields, and more to make it withstand the harsh elements of the Reach. You also can find new gear through various points of interest you encounter on your journey.</p>



<p>“Wildgate was designed for anyone that’s ever wanted to go on a daring space adventure alongside a fearless crew,” Moonshot Games studio head Jason Chayes said via release. “Players are invited to work together and confront evolving cosmic threats – whether they’re mysterious hazards of the Reach – or presented by rival Prospectors.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Wildgate will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC in 2025. There are plans to hold multiple playtests for players to get their first look at the game ahead of release. The first such playtest will take place from April 10-14 with <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signups open now</a>.</p>

LEGO has released quite a few Animal Crossing sets as it continues to build up the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-nintendo-sets"> LEGO Nintendo brand</a>, but the one that I personally like the most has just dropped to its lowest ever price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza set has dropped down to only $41.20 as part of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-spring-deal-days">Amazon Spring Deal Days Sale</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/not-so-permadeath-blizzard-revives-hardcore-wow-characters-killed-by-ddos-attacks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>"I don't feel comfortable dragging people through getting world buffs, flasks, and consumes etc., just to raid with the anxiety and probably the actuality of just being DDOS'd again and dying," sodapoppin wrote.</p>
<h2>Blizzard to the rescue?</h2>
<p>Sodapoppin allowed that OnlyFangs might continue "if we get a rollback [of the DDOS-related deaths] or I hear of some solid... DDOS protection" but added that they "don't see that happening." Last night, though, Blizzard surpassed sodapoppin's expectations and <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-response-to-the-ddos-attacks/2082423">changed its <em>Classic</em> Hardcore permadeath policy</a> to specifically deal with situations like this.</p>

<p>"Recently, we have experienced unprecedented distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks that impacted many Blizzard game services, including Hardcore realms, with the singular goal of disrupting players’ experiences," <em>WoW Classic</em> Associate Production Director Clay Stone <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-response-to-the-ddos-attacks/2082423">wrote in a public message</a>. "As we continue our work to further strengthen the resilience of <em>WoW</em> realms and our rapid response time, we’re taking steps to resurrect player-characters that were lost as a result of these attacks."</p>
<p>While Blizzard's general policy on Hardcore mode deaths hasn't changed, Stone writes that the recent deaths due to DDOS are different because they "are an intentionally malicious effort made by third-party bad actors, and we believe the severity and results of DDOS attacks specifically warrant a different response."</p>

<p>That's not entirely out of step with Blizzard's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23973734/rules-of-engagement-classic-hardcore-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft">longstanding Hardcore Mode policies</a>, which specifically prohibit "deliberate action to hamper or significantly impede the ability of other players to enjoy the game" or "actions to deliberately cause the death of another player." But those policies were designed to punish various forms of in-game griefing, not for an anonymous botnet attacking the game servers themselves.</p>
<p>Now that DDOS-related deaths are no longer permanent, the griefers responsible for those attacks will hopefully have less motivation to take out all of Battle.net just to impact one <em>WoW</em> raid. But the appeal of disrupting specific scheduled streams will remain until Blizzard can find some way to protect its servers more effectively.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At GDC 2025, I got a chance to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunderfolk/" data-ref-id="5000-646962">Sunderfolk</a>, an upcoming cooperative turn-based tactical RPG adventure that lets you play a tabletop RPG with your friends without the need to set up any physical maps or learn a book of rules. Heck, you don't even all have to be in the same place, as the game is entirely controlled via players' cell phones. I had a lot of fun playing Sunderfolk, appreciating how its approachable structure and simple combat system made for a far easier set of mechanics to grasp in comparison to the likes of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e, or Vampire: The Masquerade 5e. Plenty of friend groups who have always wanted to see what all the fuss is about when it comes to tabletop RPGs but simply don't have the time or money to jump into the hobby are going to find a lot to love with Sunderfolk.</p><p dir="ltr">In Sunderfolk, each player picks from one of six characters: the raven Arcanist is your traditional spellcaster, the bat Bard empowers and heals allies through song, the polar bear Berserker dominates the front line with a massive hammer, the goat Ranger outputs more damage the farther they are away from the action, the weasel Rogue dismantles foes from up close, and the salamander Pyromancer unleashes fiery explosions. These six characters have been tasked with defending the Arden, a peaceful town where anthropomorphic animals live together, from a growing shadowy corruption that is transforming previously manageable annoyances into monstrous threats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465045" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465045"></a><figcaption>Sunderfolk's combat is played on a hexagonal grid.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I opted for the Ranger, while two members of developer Secret Door played alongside me as the Bard and Berserker. Sunderfolk can be played alone (one player would just be controlling multiple characters, akin to Baldur's Gate 3), but most of my enjoyment came from strategizing with my teammates and trying to figure out how to best pair our unique abilities together to handle a combat situation. Up to four players can play at a time in Sunderfolk, and grabbing a group of three or four feels like the ideal way to play this game.</p><p dir="ltr">While the action happened on the TV in front of us, we each controlled our respective characters with our phones. Each character has their own deck of cards with unique abilities--the Ranger, for example, had a card that when played would release a piercing shot that could hit multiple targets in a line, while the Bard had a card that let them briefly enthral a target and move them to a different space on the hexagonal board. There's no turn order to Sunderfolk, allowing players to not only choose what they do on their turn but in what order. My teammates and I would have a brief back-and-forth to discuss our options, occasionally having someone cancel their turn in the midst of planning it out so that someone else could go first.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465049"></a><figcaption>You can play Sunderfolk virtually, but couch co-op feels like the ideal way to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the combat section I played, our objective was to defeat a bunch of bad guys who were being mutated into powerful monsters, with little timers above their heads letting us know how many turns were left before each of their transformations. The devs told me that Sunderfolk will have combat encounters with plenty of other types of objectives, like defending a point against waves of enemies. I can't speak to what these other objective types are like, but I'm curious to play them. Some of the characters have cards that felt really out of place in a scenario that was all about defeating enemies as quickly as possible--the Ranger had an option to stop an enemy from moving and then leapfrog away, for instance--and I wonder if those cards would have felt more satisfying to play when faced with a different type of objective.</p><p dir="ltr">Between missions, all the players return to the hub-like Arden, usually leveling up and unlocking new passive perks. It is in town where each player can unlock new cards and customize their deck, talk to NPCs to befriend and/or romance them, and use loot to buy upgrades to the town that can net party-wide perks. During this downtime, the action switches from the big screen to each player's individual phone, allowing people to do whatever they want (or for someone to go to the bathroom or grab a snack while others go work on their card deck or something).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465048"></a><figcaption>As you rebuild Arden, you and your friends can name parts of the town.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My favorite part of downtime is the option to name things. When our party finished funding repairs for a bridge, the player who put the most gold into the project got to name it, and then, on all of our phones, that name showed up whenever one of us visited the bridge. In addition, the NPCs would use that name when talking about the bridge. There were other fun examples of this, too, like an NPC asking the Bard to remind her what a specific thing was again, and then her using the name the dev typed in when my Ranger went to talk to her. It's a small narrative touch, but it allows you and your friends to not only build your group's version of Arden but craft stories for it too. This system of storytelling extends to other parts of the game as well. If one player romances an NPC, that will be reflected in conversations other players have with that NPC, for example, and that player will get a unique gameplay perk that relates to the romance shared between their character and that specific NPC--their connection is regularly reflected in the gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-tactical-rpg-has-a-cool-tabletop-game-master-feature-please-overlook-her-railroading-faux-pas/1100-6528484/" data-ref-id="1100-6528484">The story, action, and characters are all voiced by one actor: Anjali Bhimani</a>. From what I've heard so far, she does a remarkable job, adjusting her cadence, tone, and pitch to give all the major characters their own voice and then using her natural voice to narrate what's happening (even during combat!) and help nudge players in the right direction if they need it. This replicates the feeling of playing a tabletop RPG with a Game Master while ensuring no one at the table has to actually step up and be the one responsible for dictating what happens next and bringing the story to life. I like this choice, and after loving Amelia Tyler as the Dungeon Master in Baldur's Gate 3, I hope that this is just the natural storytelling tool for these types of games going forward. Game Masters do so much and are such a crucial part of the experience for certain tabletop RPGs, that now that I know what we've been missing all this time, I do not want to go back and play certain video games--I can feel the void in TTRPG video games that forgo that all-knowing, guiding voice.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this is to say that Sunderfolk was my favorite demo at GDC this year and is one of my most anticipated games for 2025. I can't wait to rope my friends into playing it with me in a few weeks when it launches for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC, and Switch on April 23.</p>

            <p>Dreamhaven has revealed a number of in-development projects at its showcase presented by The Game Awards, including the release date of its tabletop-inspired adventure Sunderfolk.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-blizzard-boss-details-new-company-dreamhaven">set up by ex-Blizzard boss Mike Morhaime</a> in 2020, known for his work on World of Warcraft, and includes other former staff across its two studios.</p>
<p>The biggest announcement was the 23rd April 2025 release date for Sunderfolk, from studio Secret Door, across Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch.</p>

<p>While releasing across PC and console, players will use a mobile app instead of a controller to interact with the game. The aim is to replicate a tabletop experience but in a streamlined, approachable way.</p>
<p>"As longstanding tabletop gaming fans, we at Secret Door know all too well how difficult it can be to get new players together for a shared experience. Learning rules, perceived complexity, and setup times can create challenges for playing with our loved ones," said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door. "Our goal with Sunderfolk is to leverage modern technology to make game night something everyone can enjoy."</p>
<p>"At its core, Sunderfolk is about the joy of playing together - laughter, strategy, and making memories," added Morhaime. "Just like the tabletop games that inspired it, Sunderfolk creates lasting bonds between friends and family with each session."</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sunderfolk-from-former-world-of-warcraft-boss-is-streamlined-tabletop-dnd-by-way-of-final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles-and-some-is-hidden-on-your-mobile">hands-on with Sunderfolk at the Game Developers Conference</a> (GDC) and was impressed by its mix of public and private gameplay that rewards cooperation.</p>
<p>Dreamhaven's other studio, Moonshot Games, announced Wildgate, a crew-based first-person shooter set in space. With both games, Dreamhaven is ticking both the fantasy and sci-fi boxes and providing cooperative experiences.</p>
<p>As "Prospectors", players will explore space in search of ancient relics to extract, engaging in both tactical spaceship combat and on-foot firefights with a comedy tone. A preview playtest will take place from 10th-14th April ahead of a launch later in the year across Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"Wildgate rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realises Dreamhaven's goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories," said Morhaime. "Since every match of Wildgate plays differently, there's tonnes for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we're looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest."</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Dreamhaven is working with two other studios on support projects.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159570/Lynked_Banner_of_the_Spark/">Lynked: Banner of the Spark</a> with developer FuzzyBot. Available now in early access on Steam, the game fuses dungeon-crawling with Animal Crossing-style town management in a cute sci-fi world of robots and gadgets.</p>
<p>The game will receive a full 1.0 release across Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd May, adding five chapters (totalling 40 new missions), five new bosses, a new biome, plus new weapon mods, skins, and more.</p>

			<p>Wildgate was easily the most exciting thing featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uwjr0raU7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamhaven Showcase</a> that just ended, and we're here to tell you all about it. We've been able to not only see a presentation and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-qa-were-definitely-thinking-about-joining-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk to the developers</a> but also play it. It won't be long before you get to play it, too, as developer Moonshot Games is hosting a Community Preview playtest between April 14 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. To register, head to the <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Since you might have forgotten, Dreamhaven was founded <a href="https://wccftech.com/dreamhaven-studio-blizzard-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in September 2020</a> by former Blizzard founder Mike Morhaime and other Blizzard expatriates. It's a multi-team studio, but Wildgate appears to be their lineup's jewel, and the team behind it features people like Dustin Browder and Justin Lane, who worked on games like World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Hearthstone, and lots more.</p>
<p>In the presentation, they revealed that Moonshot came up with 30 different one-page pitches and distilled them down to the top five, before eventually choosing Wildgate, which they did partially based on the studio values. The first one is 'Force For Good', which was described as a 'super important one' by Jason. This is a sci-fi-based game, and there's some bleak sci-fi out there. With Wildgate, Moonshot wants players to think about positive, optimistic futures. This pillar also ties into how the studio wishes to build the community over time and establish a positive approach to the game and how it will be released.</p>
<p>The next pillar is 'Shared Creative Ownership'. Jason said this speaks to one of Moonshot's big cultural goals: everyone on the team can contribute different ideas to help shape the game and the universe. The objective is to be 'swimming in a sea of little inventions', working together as a team to come up with ideas instead of having them exclusively driven from the top down.</p>
<p>The third one is 'Awe and Wonder'. The developers believe that games can take you back to feeling like a kid again, to seeing the world with fresh eyes and a sense of wonder when people first have a sense of the things out there bigger than them. Sometimes, that can be a feeling of wonder and happiness, and sometimes, it can be a little bit terrifying. This mix is Moonshot's goal in terms of how they are developing Wildgate.</p>
<p>Lastly, 'Memorable Stories' speaks to the kind of experience that they want users to have in the game. Due to the studio's background, the developers think a lot about things like balance and a really balanced play experience. But the goal is also that everybody leaves with a story, that something unique happens to you and the people you're playing with that's very memorable and you're taking away with you as you move on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wildgate | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2jvZzieaBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The team then offered an overview of the lore they created for the game. There's a civilization that spans much of the galaxy called the Accord, and it's made up of all kinds of strange creatures working together. They have a shared government and they exchange technologies, working together to explore the galaxy. The example Dustin shared was Star Trek's Federation, except composed of the funny creatures you might find in a Star Wars cantina. Anyway, as the Accord finds new races, they incorporate them and invite them to join, again like the Federation. Most species are reasonably peaceful after reaching space travel, except for one that claims to be the 'Firstborn'. These creatures are around 50 million years into their evolution and they're very old. They think that they are the oldest civilization, having expanded and killed off all the others they encountered, but they're actually not, as the universe also featured species that have long since vanished: the so-called Builders, Artisans, and Primes. These ancient civilizations only left behind a few, albeit immensely powerful, artifacts.</p>
<p>The Firstborn attacked the Accord, beginning a hundred-year war. Wildgate isn't actually about this war; it takes place right after. However, Moonshot still wrote hundreds of pages of in-universe history so that the game's characters are grounded in a universe that feels real. Some of the characters fought in the war, while others were in an academy and were hoping to join the war when it finally ended.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Firstborn are eventually defeated by the Accord. This Federation-like union of civilizations is now ready to start exploring the galaxy once again, and they take a particular interest in the Typhon Reach, a mysterious area of space that is full of cosmic storms and quantum meteorites. The main reason is that this sector of space houses artifacts left by those truly ancient civilizations discussed before. These artifacts can be extremely powerful. For example, they could restore a planet decimated by the war, so they are obviously in great demand. That's where players come in. Wildgate is about Prospectors who are willing to risk it all to travel to the most dangerous place in the galaxy and retrieve artifacts for the Accord.</p>
<p>In practice, this is a PvP team-based multiplayer action/adventure game. Sessions are composed of 20 players where groups of four crew a total of five starships, exploring ruins, finding experimental technology and battling other players. The Typhon Reach map is created procedurally so that it will be completely fresh in all matches, ensuring Prospectors will always be faced with a new area of space to explore. The teams need to explore and figure out what's going on in this version of the Reach.</p>
<p>Each party has its own spaceship, all of which will appear at a random location. If you die, you'll respawn on your ship. There's no limit to respawns as long as your ship is intact; when it's destroyed, it is game over for your group. The way to win is to collect the artifact and take it to the titular Wildgate.</p>
<p>It takes a variable amount of time for that gate to open. Once it is, anybody can get the artifact, put it on their ship, and fly it out of the Reach. The other way you can win a match is to be the last ship standing. Lastly, the developers told us of another far rarer (estimated to occur possibly once every fifty games or so) way that a session can end: if the last two remaining ships are fighting and both are destroyed at roughly the same time, the Reach gets the win. Matches last twenty to forty minutes. To ensure an even playing field, players get a fresh ship with every new match.</p>
<p>Having played a couple of matches, I can tell you it's a blast of fun. The art style is definitely very reminiscent of Blizzard's work, but in terms of gameplay, it reminded me a lot of a sci-fi version of Rare's Sea of Thieves, which I told the developers during the Q&amp;A. Wildgate is sandboxy enough that matches can develop very differently, though the basic loop is exploring the Reach, venturing into ruins populated by NPC monsters to gather upgrades to improve your ship as you continue to scout for the other Prospector teams and, of course, for the artifact and the Wildgate itself.</p>
<p>The shooting is arcade-like rather than realistic, fitting with the universe created by Moonshot, but it feels good. Arguably, the most fun part, though, was using Probes, little drones that you can take control of to explore other areas, discover points of interest, and, most critically, spy on enemy players. However, there's a lot more, like manning the turrets, putting out fires, and possibly boarding enemy ships to steal loot.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four main spaceships in the game, differing in shapes and sizes but also amount of health, speed, number of cannons, layouts, et cetera. The party leader will be the default Captain who chooses the spaceship. After choosing their Prospector, each of which comes with different passive abilities, players also customize the loadout with different weapons and gadgets. Personally, I loved the heal gun, which heals yourself and allies but also has a secondary fire that damages foes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wildgate 4K Preview Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ML1pHH2szaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As hinted earlier, it's not just NPCs and enemy players that you have to take care of when navigating the Typhon Reach. There are also various environmental hazards that may influence whether you win or not. Ultimately, though, while the developers reckon this is not an extraction game, the truth is you can kind of play it as one. It is entirely possible that the four crews are too focused on fighting one another while the fifth sneaks in, finds the artifacts, and makes for the Wildgate without even having had to fight the others.</p>
<p>It's way too early to come up with a definitive evaluation, but the game definitely shows a lot of promise. I do feel there's more that could be done to improve the PvE encounters, perhaps with bosses and the like. It would be especially useful if PvE-only modes were eventually to be added. Still, the game already has a solid core that could entice a lot of players to quickly jump in with their friends and have fun. Wildgate is currently slated to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with a premium business model.</p>

Samsung says it’s working with developers “to make the most out of this 3D technology,” as upcoming games like <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em> and <em>Lies of P. </em>DLC <em>Overture</em> will be optimized for the monitor. The display features a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms gray-to-gray response time, along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.</p><p>The Odyssey 3D can also convert “nearly all” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs">content into 3D using the panel’s lenticular lens</a>, but there are some big caveats. You can only use the feature if your PC has an Nvidia graphics card (RTX 3080 or higher is recommended), and you can’t use it with DRM-protected content.

            <p>
I'm absolutely naff when it comes to geography, whether it be the version in school which is actually more about rocks and rivers than places, or said places themselves and where they are. I just don't know where things are! And that's fine. Even still, like many others I partook in a good few games of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/geoguessr">GeoGuessr</a> during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and found it to be good fun, particularly with some friends. And now, five years on since that whole thing happened, the geography guessing game is coming to Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3478870/GeoGuessr_Steam_Edition/?curator_clanid=3693985">GeoGuessr Steam Edition</a>, as it's appropriately called, is actually apparently going to be an early access title. The explanation for this given on the game's Steam page is the usual kind of thing, refining gameplay, adding features, getting direct feedback. It also notes that the dev's goal is to create the "ultimate competitive and casual geography game", which is a funny goal to have in mind given that it is generally the first game you immediately think of within that incredibly niche genre.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date just yet but the Steam page says that it's actually coming next month, which is literally a week away, so you've not got long to wait. The thing that isn't particularly clear right now is how it will be priced. Right now the web version of the game, which has been around for 12 years I might add, requires a subscription to play more than three rounds a day, something that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geoguessr/comments/19aipld/pro_subscription_will_be_needed_to_continue/">wasn't all that well received</a> when the change was announced last year.
</p>
<p>
The game's Steam page does note that the price won't change during its early access period, and is unlikely to change afterwards, so this version might be a one-off payment. Fingers crossed! Bloody sick of subscription fees.

In that small sliver of footage, fans saw signs that the much-sought-after return of Lagiacrus could be happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right at the end of the Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase, over the Title Update 2 text, we hear some aquatic sounds, followed by a telltale clawed foot and scales. The signs feel fairly obvious that this is going to be Lagiacrus, a monster that hunters have been eager to fight again for quite some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Introduced in Monster Hunter 3, a.k.a. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-3-tri">Monster Hunter Tri</a>, Lagi was the "flagship monster" for the game, which meant it appeared on the box art. Alongside being the posterboy for Tri, the monster was fairly unique for one key reason: it incorporated underwater fighting. Submerged bouts were a big thing for Monster Hunter Tri, and Lagi was the prime example of that. Later versions in Monster Hunter Generations moved the fight back onto land, and the monster has been largely unseen since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At one point, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190910120310/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/lagiacrus-was-prototyped-for-monster-hunter-world" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom confirmed it had prototyped a new Lagiacrus fight</a> for Monster Hunter: World, even showing <a href="https://x.com/johntv/status/976962161116196864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some visual confirmation of it</a> during a GDC 2018 panel. It was ultimately pulled, though some of its tech was incorporated in another monster, Jyuratodus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the time spent apart has not dulled players' love for Lagiacrus. For some, Monster Hunter Tri was a big entrance into the series. And this fight, with its fairly unique look and mechanics, the possibilities for a Lagiacrus fight are simply exciting. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/13gt78b/why_does_everyone_seem_to_be_obsessed_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user pointed out</a> several years ago in a thread asking why people are so excited for Lagi, "People who wish for Lagiacrus to return generally mean for underwater combat to return also, it's sort of a package deal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique mechanics aside, Lagiacrus has remained popular in its own right. The leviathan came in third in a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/20th/en/vote-monster/result/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popularity poll for Monster Hunter's 20th anniversary</a>, beaten out only by No. 2 Nergigante and No. 1 Zinogre. One of its variants, Abyssal Lagiacrus, also came in 12th, beating out Monter Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 addition Mizutsune at 14th.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-26-1742912521189.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lagiacrus looks like it's on the way to Monster Hunter Wilds.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2022, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-lagiacrus-not-in-game-why-explained">speaking to IGN</a>, Monster Hunter producer explained why Lagiacrus wouldn't see a return in the current game at the time, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. Though the producer acknowledged the "desire is definitely there," the technical implementation is difficult.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Unfortunately Lagiacrus is just a very technological…difficult monster to implement. It's very snake-like, its parts are all kind of touching the ground at different moments,” Tsujimoto explained at the time. “So it's very like a writhing sort of ground-based monster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet now, Capcom has elected to bring the writhing monster back. Whether this is a solely land affair, a new variant, or we see some sort of implementation of water mechanics all remains to be seen. Fans, however, are certainly enthused. Refrains of Lagiacrus being "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1jjkbni/comment/mjno4nj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peak</a>" and patient fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1jjkbni/comment/mjnswza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrating their apparently successful manifestations</a> litter the comments sections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll get more details as we move past Title Update 1 and on towards the summer window for Title Update 2. But yes, it looks like Lagiacrus is going to lead the summer festivities in Monster Hunter Wilds, and that's some very exciting news for hunters new and old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, it uses new eye-tracking technology and a lenticular lens to generate high-definition 3D images without the need for any eyewear. Samsung is currently working with partners like Nexon and Neowiz to showcase its abilities. If footage isn't designed for 3D, its AI video conversion tech can transform most 2D scenes into a 3D scene, ensuring you can use the monitor for a wide range of content.</p><p>Beyond 3D, the monitor offers all the other premium features you'd expect from a high-end device. This includes a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and 4K resolution. You'll also get AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync for tear-free gaming. And if you're a fan of ambient lighting, the monitor is equipped with Edge Lighting that illuminates the space around the monitor based on the on-screen action.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/ ">Odyssey OLED (G81SF)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/ ">Pricing TBD | Release date TBD</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Available in 27-inch and 32-inch formats, the Odyssey OLED (G81SF) is all about image quality. Samsung notes that the 27-inch model offers the highest pixel density (166ppi) among any of its 27-inch monitors, making it a brilliant choice for discerning gamers. The 4K resolution supports a blistering 240Hz refresh rate, VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 for vibrant colors, and a glare-free coating to limit refractions from nearby light sources.</p><p>A 0.03ms response time makes it ideal for gaming, as does support for both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync. The screen isn't the only good-looking part of the monitor, as its slim metal frame and various built-in lights should make it a premium companion for your gaming room.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/">49-Inch Odyssey G91F</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/">Pricing TBD | Release date TBD</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>There are already many 49-inch gaming monitors on the market, but Samsung is looking to bring "curved ultrawide gaming" to a larger audience.

Paradox Interactive has announced a further delay for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>. The Chinese-Room-developed action-RPG sequel will no longer meet its previously announced "first half of 2025" release window and is instead now aiming to launch in October this year.
</p>
<p>
"Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date," Paradox explained in a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/updated-release-window">post on the Bloodlines 2 website</a>. "The game is currently in a late development stage, and feedback from the community has been taken into account during this time. The Chinese Room is working hard on quality assurance to ensure it is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience."
</p>
<p>
"Bloodlines 2 will launch in October 2025 when the game meets the technical quality standards that you, our fans, rightfully expect and deserve", Paradox added in its statement, noting an exact release date will be shared at a later date.

<p>
Today's news marks a second delay for Bloodlines 2 under The Chinese Room's stewardship, after its release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-continues-paradoxs-delay-streak-now-launching-next-year">moved out of its original "late 2024" launch window</a> into the "first half of 2025". At the time, Paradox said the game was in "a good enough place that we could have maintained our planned release window", but that pushing it back would "create a quality assurance buffer" and give The Chinese Room time to "prioritise polish".
</p>
<p>
Paradox has, of course, faced a string of high-profile development disasters in recent years, leading to CEO Fredrik Wester's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">candid admission last October</a> that, "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects... and this must change." Bloodlines 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-says-it-almost-cancelled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-earlier-this-year">almost cancelled under its previous studio</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">The Chinese Room took over the project</a>, while 2023's The Lamplighters' League was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">enough of a flop</a> that Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">opted to part ways with its developer Harebrained Schemes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Paradox has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">cancelled its Sims-like Life By You</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">indefinitely delayed Prison Architect 2</a>, and struggled to deal with the fallout from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">catastrophically premature launch</a>. The city builder sequel's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">troubled console version still appears to be some way off</a> following developer Colossal Order's admission it was struggling to overcome "hardware limitations" - despite having originally been targeting a 2023 release.

Set in an alternate version of 19th-century Japan, you’re pitted against an Emperor who has embraced outside influences and aims to destroy the Shogunate. Interested in the blend of steampunk weaponry and myth, I took part in a gameplay presentation and hands-on preview of the alpha.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Shadow of the Road Preview - Steampunk vs. Samurai Showdown</em></h2>

<p>You begin playing as two ronin in this traditional Japanese setting, where hints of steampunk weaponry from the West have invaded the land. That’s the overarching story of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>, Civil War. The Emperor has declared the end of the Shogun, using fierce weapons like flamethrowers to take out his enemies. The Shogun don't just lie down and die, however, as they recruit all warriors, even Ronin, to face the Emperor.</p>

<p>During the war, layers of personal missions, mystical experiences, and character developments impart additional tiers of narrative. Additionally, there are tie-ins with mythology, giving the title further story layers to discover. During your explorations, you can encounter yokai, who are both friendly and aggressive. While the spirits are based on Japanese lore, they are modified to fit the alternate world built by Another Angle Games.&nbsp;</p>

Medicinal items, like reishi mushrooms, are found throughout the land. These are important in keeping you alive in tough battles. Lootable items are marked with a pillar of falling blossoms making them easy to distinguish and collect. This is great for those who have issues picking out items in a realistic setting.</p>

<p>When it comes to the tactical part of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, I played through three different combat scenarios. The first is your basic tutorial combat. This mainly involves how to break an enemy’s concentration, destroy cover, attacks of opportunity, and shifting. I really enjoyed how the timeline displays turns for the whole battle, not just a single round.&nbsp;</p>

Even as a tutorial, you can lose the game if Akira or Satoru dies. Initially, I thought if one of them survived the game would continue. But I was wrong and soon the game over graphic was on my screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following combats were completely different, tactics-wise. In the second, you're tasked with protecting a young boy and fending off multiple waves of enemies. In the third, you face fire, a yokai, and exploding eyeballs. By the end of the battle, almost my whole field was an inferno. I drastically had to change how I moved my party to try and avoid getting burned, making the fight more drawn out than I would've liked. However, none of my units fell, and I was able to utilize some new ranged options I acquired in the skill tree.&nbsp;</p>

Not only do I want to learn more about how yokai appear and potentially partner with humans, but I also want to know more about these characters. How do the choices you make ultimately impact the story later on in the game?</p>

<p>These all have me wanting to fully explore the world of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>. I want to see how my choices change characters throughout the story. I want to see how yokai further alter combat and what they add to the traditional samurai combat experience.&nbsp;</p>
