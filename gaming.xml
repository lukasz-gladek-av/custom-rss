            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteamOS was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">always supposed to be bigger</a> than Valve’s own Steam Deck, and 2025 is the year it finally expands. Not only will Lenovo ship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first third-party SteamOS handheld</a> this May, Valve has now revealed it will let you install a working copy of SteamOS on <em>other </em>handhelds even sooner than that. </p><p>Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers on the Steam Deck and SteamOS, tells me a beta for other handhelds “is slated to ship after March sometime,” and that you might discover the OS <em>just starts working properly</em> after that happens! </p><p>Griffais and his co-designer Lawrence Yang would not confirm which handhelds might just start working, though there are some obvious candidates: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">the company confirmed to us in August</a> that it had been adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s controls. </p><p>Also, quite a few PC gamers have also discovered that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">Bazzite, a fork of Valve’s Steam Deck experience that I loved testing on an Ally X</a> and vastly preferred to Windows, also works wonderfully on the Lenovo Legion Go. There still aren’t that many handhelds out there at the end of the day, and I would think Valve would take advantage of work the Linux gaming community has already done on both.</p><p>Speaking of Bazzite, Valve seems to be flattered! “We have nothing against it,” says Yang. “It’s a great community project that delivers a lot of value to people that want a similar experience on devices right now,” says Griffais, adding later “In a lot of ways Bazzite is a good way to kind of get the latest and greatest of what we’ve been working on, and test it.” </p><p>But he says Bazzite isn’t yet in a state where a hardware manufacturer could preload it on a handheld, nor would Valve allow that. While users can freely download and install the SteamOS image onto their own devices, companies aren’t allowed to sell it or modify it, and must partner with Valve first.</p><p>There are some non-selfish reasons for that. Among other things, Griffais explains that the Lenovo Legion Go S will run the same SteamOS image as the Steam Deck itself, taking advantage of the same software updates and the same precached shaders that let games load and run more smoothly, just with added hardware compatibility tweaks. Valve wants to make sure SteamOS is a single platform, not a fragmented one.</p><p>“In general, we just want to make sure we have a good pathway to work together on things like firmware updates and you can get to things like the boot manager and the BIOS and things like that in a semi-standardized fashion, right?” says Griffais, regarding what Valve needs to see in a partnership that would officially ship SteamOS on other devices.</p><p>Valve isn’t currently partnered with any other companies beyond Lenovo to do that collaboration — Yang tells me the company is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld"><em>not</em> working with GPD on official SteamOS support</a>, despite that manufacturer’s claim. </p><p>Valve’s also not promising that whichever Windows handheld you have will necessarily run SteamOS perfectly — in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F529834914570306831">new blog post</a>, Valve only confirms that a beta will ship before Lenovo’s Legion Go S, that it “should improve the experience on other devices,” and that users “can download and test this themselves.”</p><p>As far as other form factors, like possible SteamOS living room boxes, Valve says you might have a good experience trying that. And partnerships are a possibility there too: “if someone wants to bring that to the market and preload SteamOS on it, we’d be happy to talk to them.”</p><p>Valve wouldn’t tell me anything about the rumors that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">developing its own Steam Controller 2, VR headset with wands</a>, and possibly its own living room box, but did tell me that we “might expect more Steam Input compatible controllers in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lenovo has announced the Lenovo Legion Go S, the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-steamos-is-available-for-third-party-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party handheld</a> gaming PC to come with SteamOS installed instead of Windows. The announcement was made on Tuesday at CES 2025.</p>



<p>Launching in May, Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS will cost $499. The <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handheld features</a> an eight-inch 16:10 touch display at 120Hz. Internal specs include a Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor,16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and a 55.5Whr battery. </p>



<p>Other features include Wi-Fi 6e support, two USB 4 ports, and a MicroSD slot for expanded storage. Regarding battery life, Lenovo says that the Legion Go S should have 2.5-3 hours on a full charge, depending on the gaming being done.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as what’s gone from the original Legion Go, the new device no longer features a kickstand or detachable controllers akin to the Nintendo Switch. By removing these features and making the device slightly smaller, it brings the weight of the Legion Go S down to 1.61lbs.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will also launch with a version that comes with Windows preinstalled for those that prefer Microsoft’s operating system. The Windows version of the device will release this month for $729.99 and include 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. As with all Windows devices, Steam can be installed as a standalone application.</p>



<p>The Windows version comes in white while the SteamOS version comes in black.</p>

                <p>Nvidia finally revealed their next-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards at CES 2025, with some big performance improvements expected thanks to the new Blackwell architecture. But since 2020 and the launch of the RTX 20 series, Nvidia has been working on and expanding its range of AI enhancements as part of its DLSS suite of exclusive features, with its latest iteration, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ray-tracing-rtx-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DLSS 4</a>, set to propel both new and older GPUs forward.</p><p>DLSS 4's biggest new feature is one that will be exclusive to the new RTX 50-series GPUs. Multi Frame Generation is the next step in the Frame Generation race that Nvidia kicked off with the RTX 40-series range. Instead of just injecting a single, AI-generated frame between two traditionally rendered one, Multi Frame Generation now offers up to four AI-generated frames to be inserted, substantially increasing a game's frame rate. Nvidia says that its new GPUs can deliver nearly eight times more performance than "brute-force" rendering, but how well each generated frame looks and how this impacts input latency has yet to be determined.</p><p>Digital Foundry was given access to an engineering sample of the RTX 5080 and limited time to test Multi Frame Generation in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and came away impressed with both the image quality and fluidity of the experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzufsxtZpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xpzufsxtZpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Perhaps more interesting are the DLSS 4 improvements that will be supported on all of Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Nvidia has updated its transformer model that powers DLSS Super Sampling, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for the first time, moving away from its previous convolutional neural networks approach. What this means is that its newer model is more adept at identifying parts of a rendered image that are important and with more granularity, offering up more stable upscaling and ray-tracing quality as a result.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817"></a><figcaption>Breakdown of DLSS 4 enhancements for various RTX GPU generations</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg"></figure><p>DLSS Super Resolution (Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling solution), Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA will be improving thanks to this upgrade across all RTX hardware, starting with the RTX 20 series. Nvidia is also adding the ability to switch between specific DLSS releases from within its GeForce Experience application in the near future, which previously had to be manually done for each game if you wanted to experiment with newer DLSS versions that hadn't been patched in by developers. This can potentially give some new life to older hardware, at least from an image-quality standpoint.</p><p>There's no question that the headline feature for DLSS 4 is the one that only works on Nvidia's latest and greatest hardware, which starts shipping later this month and will be supported in over 75 games and apps immediately. But unlike the update for Frame Generation with the RTX 40 series launch, there's a lot more to get excited about for the many more already on Nvidia's platform.</p>

<p>Valve has announced that SteamOS is being made available and launched for third-party devices moving forward. The announcement comes alongside the <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of the Lenovo Legion Go S</a> at CES 2025.</p>



<p>It also comes just months after Valve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-is-bringing-steamos-support-to-rival-handhelds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that it was working</a> on bringing the operating system (OS) to other devices</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s website</a>, Valve says that the operating system was developed to “provide a seamless user experience optimized for gaming, while retaining access to the power and flexibility of a PC.” The OS isn’t available on other handheld devices yet, but Valve says the work being done for the Lenovo Legion Go S — which comes installed with SteamOS instead of Windows — will improve the operating system’s compatibility with other handheld PCs.</p>



<p>“Ahead of Legion Go S shipping, we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other handhelds, and users can download and test this themselves,” Valve said. “And of course we’ll continue adding support and improving the experience with future releases.”</p>







<p>It’s unclear what other devices will be “powered by SteamOS” in the future, but it appears to be only a matter of time before they are announced. There’s also the recent rumors that Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on bringing back Steam Machines</a>, a decade after they were first announced and released to consumers.</p>



<p>What do you think about Valve bringing SteamOS to other handheld PCs? Do you think it impacts the future of the Steam Deck in any way? Let us know down below, and join the discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>First washing up on Rich Island, the adventure will also take Majima to Madlantis, the secret island where criminal organisation co-exist and the home of the Pirate’s Coliseum. There’s also Nele Island, which features the holy site of Palenka, and you’ll get to revisit Hawaii and Honolulu City, which was a key location for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. The events of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii take place after the story of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth concludes.</p>
<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will have ship to ship combat out in the open sea and in a large coliseum, ship boarding with combat, and ship customisation. Within the Pirate Coliseum players will take part in the Tournament of Captains, as well as other events including Quick Skirmish, Madlantis Mania, and Swashbuckler Showdown.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio previously confirmed a new release date for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, with the game now set to be released on February 21st, 2025, bringing the release date forward by a week from the original date. It will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

			<p>Today, Marvel Games and NetEase Games officially announced the details for the first season of Marvel Rivals. The season is titled Eternal Night Falls and will be adding some familiar faces to the ever-expanding roster of heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. The first season for this new Hero-Shooter will begin on January 10 at 9 AM UTC, where the Fantastic Four will be introduced to the game as playable heroes. Thus far, the title has <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/">been incredibly successful</a>.</p>
<p>The season will span over three months and will be divided into two halves. In the first half of the season, Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic will be released. For those wanting Human Torch and The Thing, you'll have to wait until the second half of the season. Season 1 of Marvel Rivals is doing more than just adding superheroes to the game, as there will be three new maps for players to explore and learn when playing.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls, make sure to check out the trailer below to get a glimpse of some of the action you will be diving into, as well as the cosmetics you can get your mitts on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zATLJ6Cqt0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to new heroes and maps, there will be some special events for players to dive into, including a new Doom Match game mode. Like many free-to-play titles with live service elements, there will be a Battle Pass for players to dive into. Compared to Season 0, this Battle Pass has over double the amount of content and rewards to get. These rewards consist of 10 costumes, sprays, and emotes to get your hands on to add some extra flair for the battleground. To purchase the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass for Marvel Rivals, it will cost you 990 Lattice, where you will then get 600 Lattices and 600 Units as a reward for completing the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Compared to other games on the market right now, the team developing this title has made it so that the Luxury Battle Passes will never expire, with Tokens purchased with Lattice being retained under specific conditions. For those interested in what these terms and conditions consist of, the developers have created both a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241225/40954_1202068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diary</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Vision</a>, where you can read about it or watch a video that explains it.</p>

Personally, that’s part of the appeal, having 20+ ways to play, and not all of them rely on twitch reflexes and precise aim. But still, there are folks who are going to bounce off of all 20 of those playstyles, and just have to watch their friends play and laugh and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">bitch about Jeff</a></span> from a distance.

But the magic of the <em>VS</em> titles is just how much can be had just randomly screwing around with characters and team builds, and wacky moves without ever having to take the games online. Seeing Magneto, M. Bison, and Dr. Doom get absolutely destroyed by a team composed of a Little Red Riding Hood, a Japanese schoolgirl, and The Mad Titan Thanos is just one of those innate charms that never gets old, solo or with friends. Best of all, there’s now three different flavors of experience to be had, with the announcement that some absolute maniacs have spent a preposterous amount of time and energy into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamping the reviled <em>Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</em> into a respectable game</a></span>. <br></p></div><div><p>Nothing about <em>Midnight Suns</em> is my jam on paper. Card-based/deck-builder games just don’t click with my brain, <em>Balatro </em>notwithstanding, and <em>Rivals </em>aside, real talk, there’s a lot of licensed Marvel trash floating out there to be avoided at all costs. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that I was around when the <em>Midnight Sons</em> arc started back in the early 90s, trying to cash in on the dark, and edgy undercurrent running through all comics, which was the style at the time. Even being the exact age when edgy comics should’ve hit my teenage brain like a wrecking ball, these guys just didn’t do it for me.</p><p>So when I tell you that I fell head-over-heels in love with <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you know how hard that game is working to get me to care. It helps that it’s from developer Firaxis, bringing its A-game to the strategic aspects of gameplay. But there’s also some absolutely delightful deep cut Marvel lore and character work going on there between the strategy. Fighting Lillith and whatnot? Sure, I guess. Making sure Blade and Carol Danvers hook up? I will MOVE MOUNTAINS. <em>Midnight Suns</em> was apparently a huge flop for Firaxis, but it’s never too late to get more people on that deeply underrated bandwagon. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of deeply underrated. It’s hard to blame anyone for giving Crystal Dynamics’ <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> game the side-eye after Square Enix’s <em>Avengers</em> debacle poisoned the well. Anyone who’s actually spent time playing it, however, knows the truth. <em>Guardians</em> is just a damn fine third-person action title that really puts in some serious work making the <em>Guardians</em> feel like a caring-but-dysfunctional family that Star-Lord has to manage. It helps, too, that Star-Lord is an infinitely more likable, thoughtful scoundrel than Chris Pratt who, even when faced with a crucial, branching choice, finds a way to keep his family together. It helps even more that he doesn’t get himself in a scenario where all he has to do is wait till the goddamn Gauntlet is off and then he can combo up Thanos all he wants but <em>nooooo, </em>he has to get his smackdown on while everybody else is trying to save the goddamn universe from being snapped, and because of him it fails, and it’s his fault, and he is scum and you know what, I may still have anger issues about that. Let me make note of that for my therapist.</p></div><div><p> It feels like all the rizz has gone out of this one since <em>Balatro</em> took its place as the de facto card game in everyone’s hearts this year. But make no mistake, the mobile card-battler is still going strong with constant updates, and is still just as fun as it’s ever been. In fact, the game’s current season includes a crossover with <em>Rivals</em>, bringing some of that game’s character art to the deck, as well as introducing Galacta into the mix. Sure, you’ll be bitching about balancing issues here too, but it’s hard to stay mad at a game you can be done with during the fifth time that accursed Wegovy commercial they keep running on a loop on Hulu plays out. <br></p></div><div><p>Of course, if you’re looking to cross enemy lines to DC, you’ve played all the <em>Arkham</em> games, and you value your time and dignity too much to play <em>Gotham Knights</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em>, you can actually try something a little different that won’t demand much aside from time and commitment. <em>DC Universe</em> is one of the few survivors of that time when every studio wanted their own <em>World of Warcraft</em> instead of their own <em>Overwatch</em>. No game survives this long without having something going for it, and in this case, with <em>City of Heroes</em> effectively a ghost, superhero MMOs a dying breed altogether, and the price being right–as in, <em>free</em>–to fool around in a big expansive superhero universe that, while it does have the usual MMO grind problems, does understand its assignment as a DC superhero simulator.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, they didn’t.

This is a real image from Acer and it makes me laugh every single time I look at it. Sure, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro Blaze 11</a></span> has two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB- A port (nice!), and a microSD card slot. It also includes solid internal specs with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840 chip, Radeon 780M graphics, 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of SSD storage. </p><p>But come on, <em>look </em>at that image above. This might be a powerful gaming device, but it’s not portable. I mean, I guess if your definition of portable is simply “You can technically carry it around by yourself,” then sure, the Nitro Blaze 11 counts as a portable PC. Still, I’m not sold on the idea that many people will want a Steam Deck-like device that’s bigger than a cat. It goes against one of the biggest selling points with these things: You can take them anywhere and play all your games easily. </p><p>Acer seems to understand that this is probably not a product for everyone and will also offer smaller, more Steam Deck-sized portable PCs. The Nitro Blaze 8 features similar specs but with an 8-inch screen and will be priced at $900. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A slightly smaller and less powerful Blaze 7</a></span> will also be available later this year for $800. </p><p>And for those of you out there who want to lug around a desktop PC crammed into a medium-sized container, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11 and its comically massive screen will be available for $1,100. At that point, you might just want to buy an actual gaming laptop.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/zuckerberg-meta-policy-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced changes to his company’s platforms this morning, all of which basically amount to toddling along like a desperate duckling after Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Honestly, I’m disappointed that he can’t even make his terrible platforms worse in an original way, instead choosing to copy Musk’s moves and parrot Trump’s talking points.</p><p>Declaring that “the recent elections… feel like a cultural tipping point toward once again prioritizing speech,” Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1525382954801931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed</a> that the company will do away with <a href="https://x.com/AngieHolan/status/1876649209081839847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party fact checking</a> in favor of community notes, a la Twitter. “The fact-checkers have just become too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they created, especially in the US,” he said. <strong>(Update 1:40pm--</strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/metas-fact-checking-partners-blindsided/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> reports that fact-checking organizations didn't know Zuckerberg intended to end their partnerships.<strong>)</strong></p><p>As part of addressing this supposed bias, Meta will also be moving its trust and safety and content teams from California to Texas, with Zuckerberg saying that “I think [this move] will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.” Elon Musk has also <a href="https://www.chron.com/culture/article/x-twitter-hq-texas-musk-19777426.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved his companies</a> to Texas, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813290895334383820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">citing</a> political reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta will also remove restrictions around topics like immigration and gender, with Zuckerberg echoing every right-wing pundit ever in saying, “What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far.” In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corporate blog</a>, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334432/meta-trump-friendly-policy-chief-joel-kaplan-nick-clegg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Kaplan</a> was a bit more obvious about who Meta is following here, writing (emphasis mine),</p><blockquote><p>We’re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate.<strong> It’s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.</strong>&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In line with this, Zuckerberg also said the platforms will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240737627/meta-limit-political-content-instagram-facebook-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring back</a> political content, saying, “It feels like we’re in a new era now, and we’re getting feedback that people want to see [political] content again,” which he says Meta will phase back in “while working to keep the communities friendly and positive.” This might ring your memory bells; <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875355425601999255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk has also claimed</a> changes are coming to Twitter to highlight more of whatever it is he considers positive given his inability to feel human joy.&nbsp;</p><p>In closing, Zuckerberg went on about global governments censoring free speech and “making it hard to build anything innovative,” noting that “it’s been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship… But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I am excited to take it.”</p><p>Zuckerberg, like other <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/13/nx-s1-5227874/trump-bezos-zuckerberg-amazon-facebook-open-ai-meta-inauguration-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech industry heads</a>, has donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Hearing his mentions of “cultural tipping point[s],” bias and censorship, foreign government interference, and being in “a new era” after “the past four years,” it feels obvious whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narrative</a> he, and by extension his platforms, wants to take up. His <a href="https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent appointment of UFC CEO Dana White</a> to Meta’s board certainly drives that home.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this is new or surprising from him, but it’s so uncreatively depressing. At least Meta’s <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-begins-randomly-showing-users-ai-generated-images-of-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent</a><a href="https://www.404media.co/metas-ai-profiles-are-indistinguishable-from-terrible-spam-that-took-over-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> debacles</a> over <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> felt like uniquely Meta fuckups, leveraging Zuckerberg’s careless obsession with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66913551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tech fads</a> and the user-driven nature of his platforms to bring his own twist to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-internet-is-full-of-ai-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degradation</a> of the internet. This is just so nakedly the party line, so obviously an attempt to curry favor, that I almost feel bad for him as I watch him swim in his oversized tshirt in front of Silicon Valley’s characterless impression of wood, reciting whatever bullshit he thinks will make the big boys like him. It’s going to be such a stupid next four years. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a French-created RPG starring some big names like Charlie Cox (<em>Daredevil</em>), Andy Serkis (everything ever), and Ben Starr (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>).

I was drawn to the attention to detail the team at Ritual Studios took to make every note and strategic choice I made in its music-based battles feel like a part of the world. The music would change depending on what instrument I wielded, each card had a different melody attached to it as I used it in battle, and because each of those cards and guitars came with different functions, I was given plenty of reason to switch between them and hear different music throughout the brief time I got to play. It’s fascinating playing an RPG and imagining that every attack, spell, and dodge could be mapped onto sheet music. <em>Fretless </em>rules, and I can’t wait to play more when it comes to PC later this year. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>XCOM</em>-inspired tactics with <em>Dishonored</em>-style stealth action.

Perhaps the only person who can answer that question is the one who directed the first game, Hideo Kojima. I loved <em>Death Stranding</em>. I loved its earnest tale of post-apocalyptic bond-building and cooperation; I loved the way I felt the terrain of its world under my feet; I loved the way its asynchronous multiplayer went hand-in-hand with its thematic concerns. But what will a sequel deliver? Will its story find bold and meaningful new directions to go in? Will its gameplay substantially build on what the first game did? Right now, I admit, it’s a bit tough for me to see how, but that only makes me more eager to find out what Kojima Productions has in the works. - Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><p>Right now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>is an enigma</a></span>. We do know it is likely one of the last marquee games for the Nintendo Switch, that it takes place entirely in the metropolis of Lumiose City, and that it will bring back the beloved gimmick of superpowered Mega Evolutions. Beyond that, <em>Z-A </em>is uncharted territory. We’ve only gotten one other game in the <em>Legends</em> subseries with 2022’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, and based on what little information we have, it sounds unlikely <em>Z-A</em> will be a carbon copy of its predecessor. </p><p><em>Arceus </em>was about capturing Pokémon in an untamed world where human/Pokémon relationships were still in their infancy. <em>Z-A</em> will be set entirely in a big city. The most exciting thing about <em>Z-A </em>is that it will show us what developer Game Freak believes the core tenets of a <em>Legends</em> game to be. Right now, we only have one game to extrapolate from, and <em>Arceus </em>was one of the best games the series has put out in several years. <em>Z-A </em>has a lot to live up to, and right now, the mystery is exciting. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-2-revealed-by-obsidian-at-e3-2021-1847082808?_gl=1*1pk71io*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjI2ODYzMC42NS4xLjE3MzYyNzE1NTcuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-2-revealed-by-obsidian-at-e3-2021-1847082808?_gl=1*1pk71io*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjI2ODYzMC42NS4xLjE3MzYyNzE1NTcuNjAuMC4w">Obsidian’s other big RPG prospect for 2025 is a sequel</a></span> to its “We don’t have the rights to <em>Fallout</em> any more” creation, <em>The Outer Worlds</em>. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> takes you to Arcadia, a planet developing skip drive technology, causing rifts all across the galaxy—so save the galaxy you must, albeit as you see fit, given this is all about how you control the story. - John Walker</p></div><div><p>I recently started watching <em>Arcane</em>, and as someone who has no attachment to <em>League of Legends</em>, I can already feel myself starting to care about its characters, but I have no desire to add another MOBA to my life.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot has confirmed that the VALORANT 2025 season, the first official “season” now that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers are pivoting away from episodes</a>, will be primarily focused on improvement. There will definitely be new content across the six acts planned for 2025, but the priority will be getting the the game into “its best shape ever,” according to the most recent dev diary.</p>



<p>What does this mean for VALORANT in 2025? It means balancing some of the most powerful and weak agents, improving the ranked experience, keeping the map rotation fresh, and saying hello to two new mystery agents.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-2025-agent-changes">VALORANT 2025 Agent Changes</h2>



<p>Agents continue to be the primary focus for VALORANT in 2025, as the unique cast of characters is what sets the game apart from other tactical shooters. After several balancing changes in 2024, more are set for 2025.</p>



<p>Iso, the recipient of a massive buff to his Double Tap shield in <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-811/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 8.11</a>, will receive some “power budget redistribution.” The agent team for VALORANT was hesitant to commit to changes to Neon though. They will revisit her “if they need to” after her drastic but necessary <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 9.11</a> nerfs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What’s New for Season 2025 // Dev Updates - VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpNsGFd74fk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The team did commit to improving two of the least popular and least powerful agents: Deadlock and Harbor. With Deadlock, the team says they are aiming to make Sound Sensors more valuable, and to give her more aggressive potential. With Harbor, they want to make him “more satisfying” to play as.</p>



<h2 id="h-ranked-and-map-pool-changes">Ranked and Map Pool Changes</h2>



<p>With six acts planned for the VALORANT 2025 season, Riot has committed to changing the active map pool each act. At the start of each act, Riot will rotate in two maps and swap two out, but have said the number “might change” throughout the year.</p>



<p>As for the VALORANT’s competitive mode, which is now the official entry point into the esports ecosystem, two crucial changes should make the climb easier. Players will now be granted a “rank shield” that protects them from dropping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-ranks-how-to-get-radiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between skill rank divisions</a> right away. This shield gives you one more opportunity to win before falling from Gold I to Silver III, for example. Finally, rank rating rollbacks (or refunds) will be added in 2025. If If a player is banned for cheating, you get refunded the RR you lost playing against them.</p>

          <p>Here at Ars, we're judicious about which of the many, many Switch 2 rumors we decide to highlight on this page. For every report on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">hardware power</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/report-switch-2-joy-cons-will-attach-via-magnets/">magnetic Joy-Cons</a> that we share, there are probably five others we see and decide are too lightly sourced, too unlikely, or just too plain obscure to spread here.</p>
<p>But when we started hearing reports that the Switch 2's Joy-Cons could be cradled on their sides and manipulated like a full-fledged gaming mouse, we knew the concept was one you'd want to hear about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rumor: More images of Switch 2 Joy-Cons have immerged from China.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://t.co/MplOUwKhRi">https://t.co/MplOUwKhRi</a> <a href="https://t.co/5ZdFmVlggl">pic.twitter.com/5ZdFmVlggl</a></p>

<p>The rumors of mouse-like functionality on the Switch 2's included controllers got supercharged over the weekend when a Reddit poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">shared detailed photos of purported Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a>, sourced from an unnamed Chinese social media user. In between the longer shoulder buttons along the Joy-Con's inner edge (SL and SR) and a new central connector port, eagle-eyed viewers noticed what looks suspiciously like the optical sensor that sits on the bottom of practically every mouse these days.</p>
<p>That could suggest a mode where you stand the controller up vertically against a hard surface and slide it around like a mouse. The layout would even allow a user to put a thumb on the face buttons and an index finger on the shoulder buttons for various "click" functions.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises.1076337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new company comprised of members from Annapurna is set to take over games and franchises that were previously owned by Private Division, a<a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-sells-private-division-gta-vi-on-track-for-release/"> studio owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>. The staff that are creating the team are those who resigned last summer after it was said that there was a significant power struggle that led to the staff resigning. Now, they are taking over the portfolio that belonged to Private Division.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company that will be inheriting the Private Division franchises doesn't yet have a name, but it will gain access to the games and franchises created by Private Division.</p>
<p>The first information came from Take-Two Interactive in November 2024, where they announced that they had sold Private Division to an unnamed buyer for an undisclosed price. In the report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Bloomberg</a>, it seems that private equity firm Haveli Investments was the "unnamed buyer" of the company, with Haveli then going on to make a deal with the Annapurna staff, which gave them the power to take care of the acquired franchises.&nbsp; According to the Bloomberg report, a spokesperson for Haveli was contacted, but they stated that "the firm did not immediately have comment."</p>
<p>Private Division was responsible for creating franchises and games such as Kerbal Space Program, Tales of the Shire, No Rest for the Wicked, and the untitled action-adventure game made in collaboration with Game Freak, which is currently codenamed Project Bloom. No Rest for the Wicked has been confirmed to continue getting support and updates, despite the uncertainty of Private Division at current. Tales of the Shire is the next game to be released, with it set to release on March 25. This game is highly anticipated by many, as it combines the farming game genre with The Lord of the Rings franchise for a cozy experience.</p>
<p>As Haveli acquired the company, they also inherited approximately 20 employees who were working at Private Division. Unfortunately, some of the staff that they've inherited will be laid off as the company gets settled and rearranged. The specifics of this arrangement have not been finalized, and staff have been told to explore their options regarding employment and instability in the company.</p>
<p>Private Division was founded in 2017 as a publisher of mid-sized indie titles. They've published games such as The Outer Worlds, Hades, and Rollerdrome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-beta-preview-new-gods-new-modes-same-moba<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a minute since we last caught up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/smite-2-preview-next-generation-of-moba" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite 2</em></a>. Announced a year ago, the MOBA sequel has seen its alpha test take flight during 2024 and is now nearing a beta period along with a wealth of new information. We had the chance to sit in on a presentation with all the details on what’s to come during Smite 2’s beta, including the scoop on a massive update.</p>

<p><em>Smite 2</em> is being primed to add five new gods as one of the biggest pieces of this update – including Aladdin, Geb, Ullr, Agni, and Mulan, along with three new modes including Joust, Duel, and Assault (which were popular modes in the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-celebrates-hitting-20-million-players-milestone" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite</em></a>). The team at Titan Forge will also be overhauling the core of Conquest mode, and adding 20 new aspects, which are game-changing play style twists for 20 gods.</p>

<p>There will also be several new items, performance optimizations, text chat, and more.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Smite 2</em>’s alpha test began eight months ago with only 14 gods available, with one mode, rough performance, and many systems lacking in depth. Since then, the development team has worked together with the community to improve the game by adding 45 gods, six modes, which lead to increased reviews and additional player feedback.</p>


<h2>How <em>Smite 2</em> Evolves The Original's Formula</h2>

<p>For those who aren’t familiar with <em>Smite 2</em>, the core starting goals shared by the team include capturing the magic of the original <em>Smite</em> and its third-person MOBA formula. They also include making targeted improvements to refine a decade-old game for a new generation of gamers, and to respect and honor the community in the process.</p>

<p>In honoring the community, that meant having to over-deliver following the alpha testing weekends. What that means is that fixes were being shipped frequently to keep progress flowing, and focusing on favorite gods to add into <em>Smite 2</em>.</p>

<p>This also included three weekly live streams dedicated to covering player questions and providing a look behind the scenes.</p>

<p>This has culminated in several milestones for <em>Smite 2</em>. The game has 45 gods, increased from the original 14, six modes instead of one, a complete art overhaul, core combat improvements and FX readability improvements, a new HUD, a new conquest map layout, big changes to monetization, collaborations such as Lord of the Rings, and much more.</p>

<p>As <em>Smite 2</em> moves into its beta phase, there’s a lot to cover in terms of what is next. One of the biggest additions will be with the new god, Aladdin, who will arrive on January 14 as part of the new pantheon Tales of Arabia.</p>

<p>Aladdin, The Sultan, is a Magical Assassin who can use the ability Three Wishes – each with powerful effects but can only be used once for came. These include coming back to life instantly, earn bonus Gold, or resetting all cooldowns. Aladdin can also run on walls, which is a new piece of tech for Smite 2. His Ultimate can trap enemies in his magic lamp to fight them, and anyone can join, which allows Aladdin to split up a fight in his own unique way.</p>

For example, Ullr’s stance swapping is further enhanced, while Mulan can plant a Consumable banner that increases XP and grants allies Movement Speed.</p>

<p>New modes will be available including Joust, which is a 3v3 match including one lane and jungle camps. Teleporters have been added for easier traversal, and stealth grass for surprise engagements. The same map is available for the new 1v1 Duel mode.</p>

<p>The Conquest mode is also being updated, which is the premiere mode for <em>Smite</em>’s esports scene. There’s some layout changes (different pathing), new jungle camps, new vision-focused camps, new jungle boss pickups like the Obsidian Dagger (which deals 500 true damage to the user but grants 20% more damage and attack speed for six seconds) from the Fire Giant, and breakables like Healing Wisps in the jungle.</p>

<p>The Aspects mode will offer a new playable twist for gods in <em>Smite 2</em>. In the lobby, players will be able to play the god normally or Aspect enabled. With 20 of the 45 available gods enabled, more will be added over time. An example of this mode is with Athena, who can no longer teleport to allies, but instead to enemies and weaken them. So those types of trade-offs are in play.</p>

There’s also updates to auto builds, role guides for all roles, role filters in the item shop, UI features like PC text chat, balance passes to improve STR and Active items, ranked reset and matchmaking improvements, as well as performance optimizations and more.</p>

<p>As for when players will be able to get their hands on <em>Smite 2</em>’s beta – starting January 7 most of the content described in this article (aside from Aladdin on January 14) will be available, alongside a developer live stream, which will also discuss everything further detail and how 2025 will certainly be a major year for the game and its evolving community.</p>
