		<p>Microsoft closed out the Xbox Games Showcase 2024 with the announcement of Gears of War E-Day, with a traditional blend of violence and emotive music – specifically a new instrumental version of Mad World to echo the series’ debut. Check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will be a prequel to the series as a whole, set 14 years before the original and depicting the events of Emergence Day, where the Locust suddenly emerged from below the cities of Sera. Not only that, but it’s an origin story for the series’ most popular protagonist, Marcus Fenix, and his long-standing friendship with Dom, from the Pendulum Wars. This also means that the game will be almost entirely fought against the Locust than the robots and other foes found in the more recent sequels.</p>
<p>The Coalition has always sought to pioneer technology with Unreal Engine and Xbox, and E-Day is no different. The game is built on Unreal Engine 5, looking to make the most of all its key tech, and showcasing it in this trailer. Just as the original Gears of War trailer was rendered in-engine, so has the E-Day announcement.</p>
<p>The Coalition touts over 100 times as much environmental and character detail than in Gears 5, hardware ray-tracing for lighting, reflections and shadows, overhauled destruction, gore and animation, and plenty more.</p>

<p>While many had expected Gears 6 to be announced this year, E-Day as a sequel is not being seen as a spin-off to the main series, but rather the next mainline entry.</p>
<p>There’s currently no word on platforms or release window, so it will be very interesting to see how that pans out, given recent rumours…</p>

		<p>The Xbox Showcase continues with the reveal of Atomfall from Rebellion. It is set in the British countryside and we can tell that’s where we are due to the use of red telephone boxes and double decker buses, the universal sign of “This is British”,</p>
<p>There seems to have been some sort of nuclear issue, the game audio references Windscale, the old name for Sellafield, &nbsp;large multi-function<em>&nbsp;nuclear </em>site on the coast of Cumbria, England. There are robots,&nbsp; glowing ghouls and destroyed landscapes to wander around, it all looks rather Fallout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall Reveal Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_HG3si5zKv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“A single player, survival-action game, Atomfall blends post-war Britain with Cold War paranoia, folk horror, and elements of classic British sci-fi like Day of the Triffids, Doctor Who and The Prisoner, to create an immersive and thrilling gameplay experience. Set in the rolling British countryside with idyllic pubs, quaint villages, and red phone boxes it soon becomes clear that things are far from normal. Created by Rebellion, the makers of the much-loved Sniper Elite and Zombie Army franchises,”</em></p>
<p><em>“Atomfall is inspired by a real-world nuclear disaster that occurred in northern England in 1957. The game follows a fictional storyline where you find yourself in the quarantine zone five years after the event. Everything has changed in that time, and you find yourself in a very different Britain, on the wrong side of the quarantine wall. The area is run by the military and beset with factions, in-fighting, and a growing sense of fear. It’s up you to unravel the mystery of what happened. Explore the countryside, villages, and settlements and meet odd people, wicked cults, rogue government agencies and others along the way. Explore this open world adventure and seek out the truth at your own pace.”</em></p>

<p>Atomfall will be coming to Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows PC in 2025.</p>

            <p>
Gears of War 6's development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gears-of-war-game-in-the-works-according-to-new-job-listings">hasn't been much of a secret</a>, but it's now finally official - with tonight's Xbox Games Showcase revealing it to be a prequel titled Gears of War: E-Day.
</p>
<p>
Set 14 years before the events of the original Gears of War, E-Day tells the story of the first Locust emergence on Sera, and the world's response to that threat.
</p>
<p>
It promises a return of the series' trademark third-person, cover-based shooting action, all within an "explosive" campaign combining "satisfying gameplay and emotive, character-led storytelling".

<p>
It's also described as a "story of many origins", and players can expect to see some classic Gears staples - including the Chainsaw Lancer - in early forms previously unseen. That includes some familiar faces, with the trailer feature very youthful appearances from Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.
</p>
<p>
"We're telling the origin story of Marcus and Dom and their bond," developer The Coalition <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/">explains on Xbox Wire</a>. "This is the bond that defines the franchise. They're not the characters we know from Gears 1 to 3. They don't have 10 years of fighting the Locust between them. When the game opens, there's supposed to be peace on Sera,'and they’re trying to figure out life without this person [Dom’s older brother, Carlos] they both loved."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft didn't provide any hint of a release window during Gears of War: E-Day's reveal, but with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-live-action-movie-and-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix">movie and animated series</a> also in the works, there's a lot for Gears of War fans to look forward to.

            <p>I feel like we've already got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-going-on-in-avowed-we-quiz-obsidian-after-the-xbox-developer-direct">pretty good idea</a> of what Obsidian's upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> is all about by now. But just in case you needed a reminder, or wanted a closer look at its colourful fantasy landscape, tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox Games Showcase</a> brought us a new 'story trailer' for it. Have a watch below.</p>

<p>As per previous Avowed trailers, you play as an envoy of Aedyr sent to investigate a mysterious plague known as 'The Dream Scourge' that's spreading through the wild frontier of The Living Lands - an all-new region of the Pillars of Eternity world we haven't seen before. </p>
<p>But as the masked, flame-eyed knight in the trailer suggests, there's more going on with the Dream Scourge than meets the eye. They call it a "symptom of a deeper, more dangerous rot" in the land, and ask you to tame the chaos so that they might rise up and shape The Living Lands' future. </p>
<p>But then a third voice chimes in saying both your Aedyr homeland and the knight are deceiving you, and that in fact there's another, unseen dimension at play here, too. Embracing <em>this</em> side of the battle and becoming The Living Lands' protector is actually where your loyalties should lie, they say, but honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if all three of them were duping you in some respect. None of them seem particularly savoury or trustworthy if you ask me, but as the trailer implies, you will eventually have to pick a side and 'forge your destiny'.   </p>
<p>Alas, if you were hoping for a concrete date on which to do so, you'll be disappointed. Avowed is still just dated for 2024 at the moment, though it will be coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on day one when it does.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft has revealed three new Xbox console variants with increased storage capacity, available at the end of the year in select markets.
</p>
<p>
Two are all-digital: a 1TB Xbox Series X in "Robot White" and a 1TB Xbox Series S in the same colour. The third is a "special edition" 2TB Xbox Series X in "Galaxy Black" that features a disc drive.
</p>
<p>
It's clear with these new consoles, Microsoft is edging ever closer to an all-digital future. The "special edition" physical console will be available in "limited quantities", but critically there is at least still an option for physical media.
</p>

<p>
The pricing is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB in Robot White - $349.99/€349.99 ERP</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 1TB Digital Edition - $449.99/€499.99 ERP</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition - $599.99/€649.99 ERP</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is a mid-generation refresh, then, and not pro versions of the console. Microsoft has not announced pro consoles, nor are they expected.
</p>
<p>
That also means Microsoft is continuing with the underpowered Series S for now, which has hampered the release of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Black Myth Wukong</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're hard at work on the next generation," said president of Xbox Sarah Bond during the showcase.
</p>
<p>The consoles will be available to pre-order in the coming months. Further details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">technical specification of the PlayStation 5 Pro has already leaked</a>, though it's yet to be announced by Sony.

            <p>At this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox showcase</a>, Bethesda and developer Machine Games gave us all another little peek at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>The team shared a look at what it calls a "pivotal cinematic", in which Indy and his sidekick (for this game at least) Gina "make a startling discovery in the Himalayas". There is a kerfuffle over a stone, and of course, some explosions and bad guys getting thrown off cliffs.</p>

<p>"Grab your hat and whip and prepare to embark on an epic, globetrotting adventure in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle," reads the official blurb. "Become the legendary archaeologist and face off against sinister forces as you fight to uncover the truth behind one of history's greatest mysteries."</p>
<p>Machine Games and Bethesda did not share a release date for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The current line is still that the game is coming at some point this year, and when it does arrive, it will be available across Xbox Series X/S and PC. This includes day one with Game Pass.</p>
<p>Elsewhere this evening, we got a look at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">new teen drama game known as Mixtape</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-happy-few-developers-south-of-midnight-launches-2025">Compulsion Games' South of Midnight</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, to name but a few.

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-6-announcement-coming-in-june-showcase-says-report">rumours</a> of a new Gears of War appearing at today’s Xbox Games Showcase were accurate - well, mostly. The next Gears of War won’t be a sequel like Gears of War 6, but instead looks to be a prequel to the entire series that returns to the very beginning of the bloody battle between humanity and the alien Locust.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The next Gears of War is called Gears of War: E-Day, referring to the universe’s Emergence Day event - when the Locust Horde invaded the planet of Sera (Gears of War’s Earth equivalent) from their underground civilisation of the Hollow, killing billions of humans and sparking the Locust War that serves as the backdrop to the games’ storyline. The first Gears of War takes place 14 years after E-Day, meaning that this next Gears will delve into how things ended up as seen in the series’ 2006 debut.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day won’t only provide a backstory for the wider Gears-iverse, as developed nowadays by The Coalition, but some origins for muscled shooterman heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago too.</p>

<p>E-Day’s first reveal trailer, as shown during the Xbox showcase, very much focused on that story side of things, with not a clip of gameplay in sight - though we do know it’ll be in Unreal Engine 5. Marcus wrestles around a house with a Locust Drone - redesigned for the prequel as a more deadly enemy than the hordes you mow down in latter-day Gears games - clocking it with a TV showing an emergency signal before finally blowing its brains out with an earlier model of the MK1 Lancer, equipped with a bayonet rather than a chainsaw. Then the house disintegrates into a glowing E-Hole, with Marcus being rescued by none other than a younger Dom.</p>
<p>The trailer simply ends with the two looking out over a city bathed in flames and destruction as spider-like Locust robots clamber over destroyed buildings on Sera.</p>
<p>In a particularly fun nod to E-Day’s place at the start of the series’ chronology, the trailer riffs on Gary Jules’ piano cover of Tears for Fears’ Mad World used in the earliest Gears of War advertisements almost two decades ago (ouch).</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day wasn’t given a release date during its reveal, but we do know it’ll land on Game Pass on day one.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft have released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-happy-few-devs-reveal-south-of-midnight-a-new-action-adventure-set-in-a-magical-realist-american-south">South Of Midnight</a>, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

<p>
To give a quick summary of all that, you play Hazel, a witchy warrior who is trapped in a "Southern Gothic world where reality and fantasy are interwoven, and ancient creatures from folklore emerge". Some of these creatures are friendly, like the drawling ornamental catfish who appears happy to serve as your noble steed. And some of them are unfriendly, like the moving island over in the distance there that is actually a massive, overgrown alligator. Closer at hand, there's some kind of twisty treeboss with glowing red weakpoints for you to dart around and combo. 
</p>
<p>
South Of Midnight's fisticuffs and exploration seem pretty familiar, but it has style. They've gone with an artfully juddery set of character animations that mimic stop motion films, a la Into The Spider-Verse. Hazel can also air-dash and glide using pop-out spooky parachutes. And then there's the woozy, dreamy guitar music, which kicks up towards the finish just before Hazel finally confronts that marauding islandgator.
</p>
<p>
Again, the game feels like more of a genre piece than Compulsion's previous creations but if it has a good story wrapped around it and doesn't turn out to be a massive swamp level, I'll probably get along with it. I hope the game's snazzy (I know, I'm old) character animations are but the first of several mildly experimental visual flourishes, though I suspect they'll prove divisive - I'm reminded a bit of Sable, whose character movement gave me nausea.

        <p>With more than a dozen jobs to perform</p>

            <p>I love me a Flight Simulator, but never more when there's some dramatic structure to my flight. That's why I've long been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>. It takes the staggeringly detailed world and flight model of Asobo's Flight Sim revival, and adds a job system on top. And now it has a release date: November 19th.

<p>We already knew that a lot of these jobs would be present, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-sequel-adds-more-than-a-dozen-new-aerial-jobs-in-2024">the announcement last year</a>, but even still there's a surprising quantity of them. Commercial flight! Sky advertising! Crop duster! Air ambulance! Emergency rescue! VIP charter service! And on, and on.
</p>
<p>Flight Sim's development team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-not-have-gamey-missions-because-we-are-not-a-game">clarified last year that these would not be "game-y" missions</a>, because Flight Simulatir is "not a game". Instead, they're designed to be simulations in the way the rest of the game is, and Asobo are working with organisations that perform these duties around the world to make it as accurate as possible.
</p>
<p>Fingers crossed it's still a <em>little</em> game-y, though. I love the rigour with which Flight Sim crafts its simulation, but then I like to clown around within it.

The in-engine trailer shows Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago dealing with the Locust menace for the first time ever on Emergency Day. As such, it can be considered a prequel to the previous games.</p>
<p><em>Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas.​ </em><br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24174798/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-cod-direct<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="uAuifH"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be released on Oct. 25, Activision and developers Treyarch and Raven Software confirmed Sunday during Microsoft’s Xbox Game Showcase and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtI25vEDx38">Call of Duty Direct</a>. This year’s Call of Duty promises to deliver “the most breathtaking and spectacular Black Ops action to date,” Activision says, with an increasing scope that will span a globetrotting campaign, robust multiplayer offerings, and the return of round-based Zombies gameplay.</p>
<p id="TJYP2Y">As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">previously announced</a>, <em>Black Ops 6</em> will be set in the aftermath of the Cold War era, in the early 1990s. The game’s campaign will be an “epic spy thriller,” Activision said in a news release, that blends stealth-based gameplay with blockbuster action in locations across Russia, the Middle East, southern Europe, and the United States. Black Ops series mainstays Frank Woods and Russell Adler will be joined by newcomers, including Troy Marshall and Jane Harrow, in the narrative.</p>
<p id="SLeftt">In the first screenshots released for <em>Black Ops 6</em>, we get a tease of some of that action and a look at the franchise’s new characters. We also get to see Adler do a sick motorcycle jump off of a cop car in what appears to be Washington, D.C. under siege.</p>

<p id="zvo9mf">Activision promises a new, refined movement model called Omnimovement, which the company says will let players “move realistically and seamlessly chain movements like a real action hero.” Omnimovement will let players sprint, slide, and dive in any direction, and new Supine Prone positioning will let them rotate while prone. <em>Black Ops 6</em> will also include other new movement options, including “corner slicing” abilities, “where as you round a corner or go through a doorway, your weapon is going to dynamically rotate in the direction that you’re rounding that corner.”</p>

Diablo 4 is Blizzard’s fastest-selling game of all time, earning over $666 million dollars in sales in less than a week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>According to cinematic director Doug Gregory, the trailer shows Mephisto playing with the emotions of Neyrelle, who is shown in the trailer.</p><p>“The brutality is there, but if you don’t believe in the relationship between Neyrelle and her mother, the other stuff is fluff,” cinematic director Gregory said in a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/the-brutality-behind-the-diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-cinematic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox News Wire</a>. “The real pain is the torment of believing your mother is alive for a second, having that ripped away from you, and knowing the person riding shotgun with you – Mephisto – can easily play with your state of mind.” </p><p>Since launch, Blizzard has released a number of content updates as part of a seasonal structure, and, most recently, launched an overhauled loot system with Season 4. Vessel of Hatred is the first of two Diablo 4 expansions known to be in development at Blizzard.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review">In IGN’s 9/10 review we described Diablo 4</a> as “a stunning sequel with near perfect endgame and progression design that makes it absolutely excruciating to put down”.

South of Midnight will arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime in 2025, although we're still waiting on a more specific release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>South of Midnight was first unveiled during last year's Xbox Showcase, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-new-game-from-we-happy-few-developer-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase">where it showed off a brief teaser</a>.

That doesn’t come too soon – reality itself has begun to fray, leading her deeper and deeper into a magical realist world, where folktale creatures have sprung to life, and corruption is overtaking the ruins left in the hurricane’s path."</p><p>The blog post also reveals that the creature Hazel was fighting is known as a Haint, "a mass of twisted negative energy given form by the trauma of the world around it."</p><p>For more out of the Xbox Showcase, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">roundup of everything that was announced there</a>. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

In early 2025, they’ll be able to realize that rather grim fantasy via an update coming to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p><p>This technically won’t be a first for the Fallout franchise, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-brotherhood-of-steel">Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel</a> let players play as a ghoul called Cain, one of six playable characters in the 2004 PlayStation 2 and Xbox spinoff. And in 2001’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-tactics-brotherhood-of-steel">Fallout Tactics</a>, characters in multiplayer can be of any of the six races featured in the game, including ghoul. But this is certainly a first for the mainline Fallout games, which have so far forced players into creating human characters before booting them out into the wasteland.</p><p>In the Fallout universe, ghouls are former humans so significantly affected by radiation that they become unrecognizable and gain certain abilities, including immunity to radiation sickness. Some ghouls lose any remaining shred of humanity to become feral ghouls, attacking the player and other creatures of the wasteland on sight.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/player-ghoul-1-1717881401520.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Fallout 76 will add a playable ghoul class next year.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In a recent interview with IGN, Fallout 76 creative director Jonathan Rush said that, as you’d expect, ghoul players shouldn’t be too concerned about radiation. In fact, radiation heals you as a ghoul.</p><p>“You get hurt and you get some radiation, go drink some dirty water, you'll heal,” Rush explained. “Radiation will also be positioned to have other very striking benefits, punctuated a bit more by the dozens of ghoul-specific perk cards that we're going to be adding.”</p><p>This is quite the departure for Fallout and indeed the way players have been trained to behave in the games. In Fallout, players strive for protection against radiation and take drugs that mitigate its effects. One of the benefits of wearing Fallout’s iconic Power Armor is that it confers extra radiation protection upon the player. But as a ghoul, it’s in your best interest not to wear Power Armor because you want all the exposure to radiation you can get.</p><p>Rush said the hope is this will encourage a play style we’ve never really seen in Fallout before. “A player who doesn't wear Power Armor has just freed up a ton of perk points they can use in a whole bunch of different other ways,” Rush said, “which is a whole different play style in itself. And you layer on all the perk cards and it's going to be cool.”</p><p>But don’t go thinking you can start playing Fallout 76 as a ghoul straight away — it’s a level 50 requirement.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/02/fallout-1701198352032-1701533962477.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Ghoul in the Fallout TV show doesn't worry about radiation, and neither will ghoul players in Fallout 76.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The addition of playing as a ghoul comes following the breakout success of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV show</a>, which stars Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, an imposing wasteland veteran who has emerged as perhaps the most-popular character in the Prime Video series.</p><p>Rush said the development team has talked about ghouls “for a while," but “wanted to take the time to figure out what it meant to play as a ghoul and how that would fit, and how we've seen players play 76.” So, this update is not necessarily jumping on the popularity of the Fallout TV show, but will obviously benefit from it.</p><p>“It felt like the right time as we have a lot of in-game players level 50+ that may want to experience different ways to play through more difficult in-game content,” Rush added.</p><p>One intriguing element of the Fallout TV show — which, remember, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-official-timeline-confirmed-how-the-show-fits-in-with-the-games">takes place after all the Fallout games and is considered canon</a> — is that ghouls must regularly consume a strange yellow substance in order to stave off the inevitable feral turn. We see The Ghoul struggle to manage his dependence on this mystery drug as he goes about his death-dealing business.</p><p>So, the inevitable question is, will Fallout 76 players who become a ghoul need to similarly regularly consume a drug to prevent them from becoming a feral ghoul? “Possibly…” Rush teased.</p><p>In the short term, Fallout 76 will expand its Appalachia map with the release of the Skyline Valley expansion on June 12.</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">BioWare sticking with a vague Fall 2024 release window for now.</h2></div><section><p>BioWare revealed the first trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard at the Xbox Showcase on Sunday, seemingly confirming the return of at least a couple familiar faces but holding off on a formal release date for now.</p><p>The breezy trailer, which is just under two minutes, introduces several characters who players can expect to journey with in BioWare's new RPG. They include Benara the Veil Jumper, who is seen leaping out of a portal only to be dragged back in; Davrin the Warden, Emmrich the Necromancer, Neve the Detective, Lucanis the Mage Killer, and Taash the Dragon Hunter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>BioWare previously confirmed that Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be centered around seven companions, prompting the name change from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. All of the companions look to be revealed in the trailer, which cuts from the next in the course of their various adventures.</p><p>In addition, the trailer offers a brief glimpse of two faces that should be familiar to longtime fans of the series: Varric and Lace Harding. Both can be seen reacting to the action in a handful of shots, suggesting they will have a role to play in the story. Varric was first introduced in Dragon Age II as a companion to Hawke, while Harding was introduced in Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p><p>The trailer ends with a basic fall 2024 release window, meaning fans will have to wait a bit longer for an exact date. That release date is in line with recent speculation, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-reportedly-due-out-this-financial-year">with one report saying</a> that BioWare was planning to debut the next Dragon Age game within this financial year. It's now been nearly 10 years since the most recent Dragon Age title, Inquisition, so fans have been anxiously awaiting a release date for quite some time now, to say the least.</p><p>In the meantime, BioWare has continued to slowly trickle out more information, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-teaser-hints-at-key-locations-full-reveal-coming-in-summer-2024">previously announcing</a> that the full reveal of Dragon Age: The Veilguard would be coming this summer. The studio previously revealed an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-in-game-cinematic-focuses-on-solas-and-sets-the-stage-for-the-upcoming-rpg">in-game cinematic in December 2022</a> that focused on Solas, a playable companion in Inquisition who will have a significant role in The Veilguard — especially considering that the previous name of the game, Dreadwolf, is one of his aliases. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/05/dragon-age-1717623768389.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ten years after Inquisition, Dragon Age: The Veilguard finally has a release date. (Image courtesy of EA/BioWare)</figcaption></figure></output><p>It's the latest major info we've gotten on the highly anticipated fantasy RPG following the name change earlier this week. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">In an exclusive interview with IGN</a>, BioWare general manager Gary McKay revealed some more details on what to expect from The Veilguard, as well as explaining some of the logic behind the name change. </p><p>“One thing that’s important to remind fans is that every Dragon Age game is a new and different experience and this game, more so than ever, is about you and your companions – a group that you must rally to fight by your side,” McKay told IGN at the time. “...“In the end, it was most important for us to have a title that was authentic to the companions that are the heart of this adventure we’ve created."</p><p>The pressure on The Veilguard is undoubtably high for EA and BioWare, and it may just be the highest-stakes BioWare release yet. The studio <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">suffered painful layoffs last year</a> and the next installment in its other major series, Mass Effect, is still in pre-production.</p><p>We'll learn a whole lot more when The Veilguard has its gameplay reveal next week. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft just wrapped up its June 2024 Xbox Games Showcase, revealing a smorgasbord of details about games new and old.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Xbox Showcase 2024 Games</h3><p>Every game featured at the Xbox Showcase from June 9, 2024.</p></div><p>Highlights from the hour-and-a-half show include a nice selection of titles from Bethesda, Activision, and more, including sneak peek trailers for games like Doom: The Dark Ages, State of Decay 3, and, of course, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. There was a lot to cover across the Microsoft presentation’s runtime, but we managed to compile all of the highlights for you here. If you want to peek behind the curtain of the future of Xbox, look no further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 kicks off the showcase with a gameplay trailer</h2><p>As new Call of Duty games release every year, we get to see the new settings that millions of players will soon enjoy. That’s exactly what today’s trailer gave us a look at, revealing a post-Cold War era for the world of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and some of the characters that star in it. This is a teaser video for those who have been hoping to see the series return to the past for years. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles later this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages officially revealed by id Software</h2><p>Doom is back. At the Xbox Games Showcase, series developer id Software <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024">revealed Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, a medieval take on the legendary FPS franchise that is coming to PC and consoles later this year. First gameplay for the project revealed a game that is undeniably Doom while also looking like something fans of the franchise have never seen before. This interesting twist might have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-doom-game-has-a-name-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase-report"><u>leaked ahead of its official reveal</u></a>, but that trailer still packs a punch.</p><p>Take a look at this first trailer, which includes first footage of a chainsaw shield, some impressive gore mechanics, and a few new brutal weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>State of Decay 3 reappears with new trailer</h2><p>Developer Undead Labs <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-showcase-state-of-decay-2"><u>revealed</u></a> State of Decay 3 all the way back in 2020, and at this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, we finally got another trailer. Footage of the zombie survival game revealed an entry that encourages players to look for signs of hope as waves of zombies swarm them and their friends. The trailer mostly sets up the world of State of Decay 3 while introducing some gruesome new enemies, which you can now watch in the video above.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard trailer reveals a better look at BioWare’s next RPG</h2><p>BioWare showed up for the Xbox Games Showcase to give players what is likely their <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>best look at the recently renamed Dragon Age: The Veilguard yet</u></a>. Alongside a host of new information, the footage revealed that a few familiar faces will be making a return, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Starfield DLC trailer shows off a first look at Shattered Space</h2><p>Starfield has been out for nearly a year, so it’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-shattered-space-dlc-first-official-trailer-gives-players-a-first-look-at-house-varuuns-homeworld-xbox-games-showcase-2024">finally time to learn more about its first major expansion, Shattered Space</a>. Bethesda has talked about the DLC content for some time now, but today’s trailer finally gave us a clearer look at how it will expand on the already massive sci-fi RPG’s universe with colorful new locations and story moments. Though a release date outside of the promise to launch in 2024 was not revealed, Starfield players can look forward to a laundry list of new content that is launching later tonight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 trailer reveals 2025 launch</h2><p>The Xbox Games Showcase gave gaming fans lots of updates on games they already know about, but it also revealed new games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-from-sandfall-interactive-announced-for-2025">Kepler and Sandfall Interactive’s third-person adventure game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Little is known about this mystical Xbox title outside of the fact that it promises to come to Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X | S, and PC sometime in 2025. You can watch the first trailer, which is filled with mind-bending locations and strange enemies, above.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>South of Midnight gameplay trailer reveals magical swamp combat</h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-reveals-new-trailer-showing-gameplay-and-lively-animation-xbox-showcase-2024">South of Midnight reappeared at the Xbox Games Showcase</a> to deliver a look at its humid swamp settings and the combat players can enjoy when adventuring through them. This stylized third-person title was previously <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-new-game-from-we-happy-few-developer-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase"><u>revealed as the next title from the We Happy Few team last year</u></a> and features cutscenes with mesmerizing stop-motion-like movement. Expect to see more from its magical alligators and catfish as we move closer to its release on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X | S, and PC in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer sets up Konami’s remake</h2><p>Konami has been quiet when it comes to revealing details on its Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, during the Xbox Games Showcase, we got see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase">a few new clips of gameplay</a> that include important story beats from the game’s opening moments, Snake using his iconic CQC techniques, and even a fight against a helicopter. Though more than a few major characters, like the Boss herself, made their first appearances in this trailer, we were still left without a release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Perfect Dark reboot finally reappears with a first look at gameplay</h2><p>Perfect Dark has remained in the shadows since it was revealed many years ago, but during today’s Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft finally gave us <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-finally-shows-off-its-perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-games-showcase-2024">a nice long look at what the team at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics have been up to</a>. The extended look at gameplay shows Agent Dark as she sneaks over and around city streets while taking out enemies with style. Perfect Dark is looking good so far, but we’re still left without a release date. However, the trailer did at least confirm that the title will be available day one on Game Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Fable conjures up a first look at gameplay</h2><p>Playground Games has shown us a few sneak peeks at its next Fable game, but today’s appearance gave us <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-fable-reboot-shown-off-with-new-trailer-and-a-2025-release-window-xbox-games-showcase-2024">a solid look at its gameplay for the first time</a>. Specifically, the footage focused on Humphry, a retired hero, as he warns us about what it takes to make it in this new magical world. We’ll learn more about this fresh take on the franchise and its giant toads as we inch closer to its 2025 release on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X | S, and PC.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Life Is Strange returns to a classic character with a new entry</h2><p>Square Enix and Deck Nine Games revealed that the next Life Is Strange game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-finally-shows-off-its-perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, will put the focus on the protagonist that started it all: Max Caufield. This grown-up version of the character fans know and love is still using her time-skipping powers, but this time, she’s accidentally thrown herself into a parallel universe. Players will use these abilities to solve teh same murder across two timelines when the game launches on October 29, 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle trailer fights through the cold</h2><p>The Indiana Jones franchise is known for its globe-trotting adventures, and in today's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-gets-new-trailer-but-still-no-release-date-xbox-showcase-2024">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle gameplay trailer</a>, we got to see the antics Indy will get up to in the Himalayas. MachineGames' sneak peek mostly focuses on the cinematics this time around, but the video still fits in at least a little bit of the project's punchy, whip-wielding gameplay. There's no release date yet, so we'll ahve to wait to see more from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle before it launches sometime this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Avowed trailer takes a deep dive into Obsidian’s next RPG</h2><p>Avowed will soon join Obsidian’s long list of RPGs, and at the Xbox Games Showcase today, the team gave us a better look at the lush fantasy world awaiting players when launch arrives later this year. Yes, there is still no release date, but the footage shown should help keep players waiting. Alongside sweeping shots of bright locations filled with vibrant purples and blues, we can see fire and ice magic combat, traps, and an variety of enemy types. Avowed launches for Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X | S, and PC in 2024.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/09/vlcsnap-2024-06-09-13h22m01s734-1717957563361.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>XBOX SERIES X | S UPGRADES ARE ON THE WAY. IMAGE COURTESY OF MICROSOFT.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>New digital Xbox Series X console revealed</h2><p>The Xbox Games Showcase does focus on all of the games players can look forward to in Xbox's future, but it also revaled some of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-all-digital-edition-officially-announced-xbox-games-showcase-2024">the new hardware that will soon be available to purchase, too</a>. Microsoft unveiled upgraded Xbox Series X | S consoles today that come with additional storage for those looking to download all of the hottest Game Pass releases. The presentation also came with the reveal of an all-digital, white version of the Xbox Series X.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Gears: E-Day reveal trailer reveals Gears of War prequel game</h2><p>It’s been five years since the release of Gears 5, and now we finally know what developer The Coalition has been up to. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-6-officially-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-2024">first trailer for Gears: E-Day</a> has revealed that the long-awaited continuation of Microsoft’s brutal cover shooter series will be a prequel centered on a young Marcus Fenix. We’re not too surprised to see the Gears of War franchise finally make a comeback with a new mainaline entry, but it’s still so nice to see those Lancers revving up once again.</p><p>You can watch the Gears 6 trailer above, but you might want to get ready to fight back some tears as a familier face and tune both return. No release date for Gears: E-Day was revealed, but it will launch day one on Game Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 officially revealed</h2><p>Activision is now under the Xbox umbrella, and that means we got a full look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. We nearly made it to the show before most details on this year’s installment in the long-running FPS series leaked online. Still, the show itself gave players plenty of new details to mull over while we wait for launch to arrive on October 25, 2024.

                <p>There's a lot going on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, with its world being infested with a life-twisting pestilence called the Dreamscourge, but a new trailer suggests you'll also have a lot of competing influences of the human variety to deal with during the game.</p><p>Developer Obsidian Entertainment showed off the trailer during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, with a whole lot of new gameplay and voiceover from three different characters--all of whom suggest the others are lying to you. That already creates a convoluted sense of the plot in the Living Lands, the game's setting, where it seems a lot of people will want you to help them achieve their goals, and it'll be up to you to navigate their agendas to do what's best for you, and maybe, the rest of the island.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Avowed Gameplay Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Check out the trailer below.</p><p>The description for the trailer provides a little more context, giving a little further depth on the fact that, yeah, a lot of people want to shape the Living Lands for their own ends.</p><p>"Explore the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger. As an envoy of Aedyr, you are sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague with a secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save the island and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them apart?"</p><p>Meantime, the trailer shows the kind of power you're going to wield as you decide what to do about all these different folks and their ideas about what the future of the Living Lands should be. That includes a ton of powerful magic that you'll use against people who look like they've been infected by the Dreamscourge, which is described as "a mysterious plague of the soul," to turn them into some kind of strange, almost-ethereal creatures. We also spied some other gameplay, including some light first-person platforming, suggesting you'll be making your way through the Living Lands' deep wilds as well as its towns and cities.</p><p>Obsidian shared even more details in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/avowed-story-companion-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire article</a>. Your role as the envoy of Aedyr puts you at the epicenter of tensions between the empire and the locals of the Living Lands. The first voice in the trailer is Aedyr's emperor, who's worried the Dreamscourge could rampage through the Living Lands and eventually threaten his realm, so your job is to find the source of the plague and stop it. The second voice is Inquisitor Lödwyn, who adds some caveats about conquest to the proceedings. She's "the leader of the Steel Garrote--an extremist paladin order from Aedyr--[who] believes there’s something more sinister at play and calls on you not only to eradicate the Dreamscourge, but also to bring the island’s unruly factions to heel."</p><p>The third and final voice is that of Giatta, one of your four companions in the game, who we also see in the trailer zapping people with magic. She's an animancer, someone who studies soul magic, and according to the article, "perceives a larger and more mysterious force at work in the land and urges you to embrace it in all of its awe and chaos. As a stranger to these shores, you’ll need to navigate your relationship with all three of these factions, work to uncover the source of the Dreamscourge and prevent it from plunging the Living Lands into madness."</p><p>As for other hard details, there aren't many in the trailer. We know Avowed is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime in 2024, and that it'll be on Game Pass on day one--but that's about it.</p>

                <p>Rebellion has been synonymous with the Sniper Elite series, but during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">Xbox Showcase</a> at Summer Game Fest 2024, the studio debuted a new survival-action game that is blending a wild variety of aesthetics and time periods called Atomfall.</p><p>The first-person action starts off in an idyllic British countryside besieged by autonomous mechs, but quickly moves towards some striking underground caverns with arcane-powered ghouls to contend with. The manner in which the trailer swings between these two settings is both confusing and captivating, giving little sense of how they might relate to one another but certainly making a strong case for the action that's unfolding in both.</p>

It's also releasing on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>
