            <p>Sony says that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on sales.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1854839684054368505">Genki_JPN</a>, Sony president, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the system was "targeted" at "hardcore users", not casual players.</p>

Sony says the growth in its game and network services division can be attributed to rising sales of its third-party games, DLC, and PlayStation Plus subscriptions.</p>
<p>131.3m games shipped in the first half of the financial year, of which 11.3m were first-party games. 1.5m of those alone come from Astro Bot, which only debuted in September.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/789755286/Nintendo-vs-Keighin"> papers filed</a> on Wednesday and reported by<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/476472/nintendo-lawsuit-pirated-games-streamed"> Polygon</a>, Nintendo has taken legal action against streamer Jesse Keighin - streaming as Every Game Guru - who allegedly played 10 unreleased Nintendo games over the last decade.</p>

<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>The Japanese megacorp says Keighin's conduct has cost it "millions of dollars" in "lost video game sales". It's seeking £11,600 ($15,000) for each alleged violation of its Copyright Act, £1900 ($2.5K) for each contravention of its anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions in the Copyright Act, and further "actual damages" for the revenue it says it has lost, the amount of which Nintendo says it will "prove at trial".</p><p>"Streaming leaked games prior to their publication normalises and encourages prerelease piracy - Defendant is signalling to viewers that they too should acquire a pirated copy and play the game now, without waiting for its release and without paying for it," Nintendo's lawyers wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>"Prerelease piracy harms law-abiding Nintendo customers who may have been waiting for a particular game release for months or years, and then may see gameplay and spoilers online that ruin their own surprise and delight when experiencing the game."</p>
<p>"We can confirm that we filed a lawsuit against an individual who has engaged and continues to engage in clear infringement of Nintendo’s IP rights, as well as violations of our Game Content Guidelines," Nintendo told Polygon in a subsequent statement.</p>
<p>"Nintendo is passionate about protecting the creative works of game developers and publishers who expend significant time and effort to create experiences that bring smiles to all."</p>
<p>Keighin did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Nintendo is also suing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair. The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pokémon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents"> Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation"> Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.</p><p>Yesterday,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says"> Pocketpair revealed that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year</a> - after Palworld's launch. However, they relate to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch, meaning they could indeed still apply to Palworld now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-polaris-first-character/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first character to be featured in The Witcher 4 Polaris, the highly anticipated next entry in the series by CD Projekt Red, has been revealed via an online actor's resume.</p>
<p>According to information discovered on Spotlight by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KekanKok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KekanKok</a>, British actor <a href="https://app.spotlight.com/4850-0168-8030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Lampert</a> will play a character called Branko in the next entry in the series. Interestingly enough, the role is dated 2025, indicating that voiceover recording and motion capture for the character will begin next year and that the game is still pretty far from release.</p>
<p>Last we heard, The Witcher 4 Polaris was still in the preproduction phase but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/">close to a major milestone</a> that would mark the end of this phase and the beginning of the actual production phase. No update on the project has been provided since August, but if the game's development proceeded as intended, it must have entered the actual production phase by now, as that was the plan earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be CD Projekt Red's first game developed using Unreal Engine 5. While this was met with skepticism from the vast majority of fans, it could actually be a great thing for the gaming industry as a whole. If there's one developer that could help Epic address the stuttering issues that continue to plague all games powered by the engine, it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be released on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

		<p>There’s a busy weekend ahead of staring at gameplay capture and trying to figure out what’s different and improved. My very first impression going from PS5 to PS5 Pro has been that Insomniac are wizards at blending art direction and graphics to get the most out of a console.</p>

		<p>Amplitude Studios, the developer behind the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/30/endless-dungeon-review/">Endless</a> series and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">Humankind</a>, has gone independent once more, with Sega selling the studio back to members of its internal team.</p>
<p>Sega says that this “concludes the structural reforms that have been taking place in Sega’s European business”.</p>


<p>Amplitude Studios founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis <a href="https://twitter.com/Amplitude/status/1854796059119136979">made the announcement</a>:</p>
<p><em>We’re thrilled to announce that our studio is officially returning to independence!</em></p>
<p><em>Amplitude is now owned by members of the internal team, meaning that the future of our studio and games is staying in the hands of those who know them best.</em></p>

<p><em>Being part of the SEGA family and working with their team for the past eight years has been an incredible journey. We’ve learned so much, have grown in ways we never could have imagined and have made great friends along the way. As our paths now head in different directions, we’re parting ways on the best of terms and we’ll continue to cheer them on as they take on new and exciting things in the future!</em></p>
<p><em>By returning to our indie roots we’re getting back to the heart of what drives us: creativity, innovation, and close-knit collaboration with our community. These values have shaped who we are from the beginning, and will lead the way forward in this exciting next chapter.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for being with us every step of the way! Here’s to a new beginning, and to all the amazing things we’ll create together.</em></p>
<p>Sega acquired Amplitude back in 2016, the French studio having made a name for themselves within the 4X strategy realms with Endless Space and Endless Legend, and has long been a proponent of developing in tandem with its community. At the time, Sega was looking to expand its reach into PC gaming, alongside the Total War franchise at Creative Assembly and RTS gaming at Relic.</p>
<p>The last year has seen great upheaval at Sega’s European arm, though, with some disappointing game launches including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/ca-make-pledges-on-total-wars-future-issue-total-war-pharaoh-partial-refunds-and-lower-price/">Total War: Pharaoh</a> and Company of Heroes 3, the cancelled extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/28/sega-cancels-hyenas-and-other-unannounced-titles/">Hyenas</a>, and over the last few months, the extended development that is going to be needed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/football-manager-25-has-now-been-delayed-to-march-2025/">Football Manager 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">Sega announced 240 job cuts</a>, hitting Creative Assembly hard as game projects were cancelled, and spinning off Relic to let them go independent. Now Amplitude is following in Relic’s footsteps.</p>
<p>This is the right way to handle things, compared to some notable studio closures that we’ve seen elsewhere in the industry. Obviously we’re not privy to the discussions and options being explored by other publishers, seeing studios like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">Firewalk</a> simply be shut down, or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Tango Gameworks be shut down</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">then rescued months later</a> is much worse as teams are completely dismantled and not given another chance.</p>

              <section>

                <p>Stalagmites are a somewhat new item in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>that many players are still confused by. In-game, they're known as Pointed Dripstone, which comes in two different varieties. Stalagmites are Pointed Dripstone that point up, and they're a hazard in caves where they most commonly spawn. To learn more about stalagmites and what they can do in Minecraft, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>What is Pointed Dripstone in Minecraft?</h2><p>Pointed dripstone is the name for both stalagmites and stalactites in Minecraft. Stalagmites point up from the ground while stalactites point down from the ceiling. Both spawn in dripstone caves, where they form naturally when connected to dripstone blocks. Dripstone blocks have the ability to grow pointed dripstone beneath them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374256-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.42.36.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374256" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374256-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.42.36.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374256"></a><figcaption>How to make a dripstone block in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374256-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.42.36.02.png"></figure><p>You can mine both pointed dripstone and dripstone blocks in the caves where they spawn. Any tool can be used to mine dripstone, but a pickaxe is the quickest way. You're also able to craft a dripstone block by combining four pointed dripstones at a crafting table. This allows you to choose where you place pointed dripstone and grow more of it.</p><h2>How to get Pointed Dripstone in Minecraft</h2><p>Now that you understand what pointed dripstone is, how can you go about finding it? Dripstone caves are located in overworld cave biomes and can be generated at any height. However, they most commonly occur away from water, so you want to mine as far inland as possible to find the caves. Essentially, you can find dripstone caves like any other cave.</p><p>Dripstone caves feature a plethora of stalagmites and stalactites, so you'll immediately know when you've found one. Pointed dripstone occurs nowhere else naturally, which means if you see a block of it, you're near or in a dripstone cave.</p><h2>What can Stalagmites do in Minecraft?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374257-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.17.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374257" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374257-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.17.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374257"></a><figcaption>Stalagmites point up from the ground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374257-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.17.67.png"></figure><p>Regarding stalagmites specifically, they don't have a ton of use in Minecraft. However, stalagmites are one of the most dangerous blocks you can encounter. If you fall on top of one, your fall damage is doubled, which can mean death from certain distances. This also applies to mobs, so you can set up some nifty traps around your base using stalagmites if they're placed properly. This doesn't apply to mobs that are immune to fall damage.</p><p>Aside from dealing damage, stalagmites are mainly used for decoration in players' bases. When paired with a stalactite, they can look quite nice in the corner of a room or as a focal point in a basement lair.</p><h2>What can Stalactites do in Minecraft?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374258-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.52.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374258" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374258-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.52.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374258"></a><figcaption>Stalactites point down from a block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374258-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.52.77.png"></figure><p>If you're curious about stalactites as well, they have an additional use in Minecraft. By placing a stalactite connected to a water source over a cauldron, you have a small chance to drip water into the cauldron. This also works with lava, but the chances are much smaller. If water or lava is dripped into the cauldron, it raises the liquid level by one every time until the cauldron is full.</p><p>The water or lava source connected to the stalactite cannot be moving for this to work. The source needs to be still, but a waterlogged block works as well.</p><p>Stalactites can deal damage to you or mobs if they fall. However, this only occurs if the block connected to the stalactite breaks, so it's not as useful as dealing damage with a stalagmite. </p>

<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Treyarch’s Miles Leslie took a deep dive into the success of Black Ops 6. He was talking about the power of Game Pass and how it has allowed many ‘on-the-fence’ players to find their way into Call of Duty but mentioned that the difficulty will now rest in <strong>keeping those players </strong>on board.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that on PlayStation and Steam, sales of this year’s Call of Duty title beat last year’s by at least 60%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 is a phenomenal success – Activision confirmed it was the biggest release in Call of Duty history just days after the game hit the market. It’s proving to be holding firm as time goes on, too – the energy in anticipation of the game’s first season is electric and palpable, and this year, the roadmap has some real potential.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Black Ops 6</a>, I said it was the best we’ve had in years.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with the BBC</a>, Miles Leslie, a sixteen-year veteran of Treyarch, mentioned that Steam and PlayStation-based sales of Black Ops 6 have beaten those for Modern Warfare 3 by 60%. We already knew it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-biggest-launch-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a roaring success on Game Pass</a>, as it caused the most new subscriber adds ever for a new game, but it’s encouraging to see it won big figures across the board.</p>



<p>In the run-up to Black Ops 6 being released, Activision’s teams pushed out a marketing campaign like no other, which some believed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rivalled that of a major blockbuster</a>. It seemed that no matter where you turned, the Black Ops 6 branding was visible. </p>



<p>Leslie also said about the title launching on Game Pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we’ve seen is it’s allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, ‘I haven’t played in a while’ to actually come back and try the game. </p>



<p>Obviously there’s things that we can improve and we’ve got our finger on the pulse of the community so that we can hear those things and analyse them and really attack and fix them in the right ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has finally gone gold after many years of development. The open-world survival shooter, which is one of this year’s most highly anticipated games, has been in development on and off for more than a decade, but on November 20, it’ll finally be released to the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>I played Stalker 2 at Gamescom and can attest to how incredible of an experience GSC has compiled for long-awaiting fans. It was an entirely different world when the last major Stalker game was released, and what we’ll be getting our hands on when November 20 comes around is leagues beyond what already exists in the series.</p>



<p>From sumptuous visuals to a remarkable combat engine, and intense survival mechanics to an open world bursting with side activities, Stalker 2 has stacks of meat on the post-apocalyptic bones.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will drop on the Game Pass subscription service the day it launches, which is a huge win for gamers everywhere. If you’d rather go above and beyond, the game has a <strong>ridiculous </strong>collector’s edition that’s probably one of the most expansive versions of a game I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>Recently, the team also revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PC requirements</a>, unveiling a specification that’s not all that demanding, considering it’s a top-shelf open-world game being released in late 2024.</p>



<p>Are you going to be playing Stalker 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about the game.</p>

<p>Tony Todd, the voice of Venom in Spider-Man 2, has sadly passed away at the age of 69. The late actor’s representatives first revealed the news to Deadline, stating that he died of natural causes. It was confirmed that he passed away in his home in Los Angeles on November 6, one month before his 70th birthday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-legendary-presence">Legendary Presence</h2>



<p>Tony Todd enjoyed a lengthy, star-studded career that included 40 years of television, film, and video games. Best known for his role in the Candyman movies, this enigmatic and versatile performer contributed to hundreds of productions over the years.</p>



<p>His spree through video games started in 1998 with a Star Trek title, and a few years later, he was voicing aliens in Half-Life 2. He’d come to play characters in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Dota 2, and Back 4 Blood, but his most recent and impactful role was as Venom in Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>While playing Venom, Todd revealed that he spent more time in the voiceover booth than in any previous role in his entire career. He also played fast and loose with some of the game’s juicier tidbits before launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-september-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasing the release date</a> and content drops on social media, much to the amusement of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Tony Todd was a talented and spirited individual known by many as a gentle giant, and he’ll be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with those who survive him.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The first season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review">Netflix and Riot’s <em>Arcane</em></a> animated series fashioned disparate pieces of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"><em>League of Legends </em>lore</a> into a beautiful, devastating tale about a society on the brink of collapse. The show infused each of its characters with a depth and complexity that felt unlike anything Riot had done <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22567914/league-of-legends-riot-games-sentinels-of-light-novel">elsewhere in the longrunning franchise</a>. And its commitment to telling its own story made it remarkably easy for new fans to dive in.</p><p>There’s a density to <em>Arcane</em>’s second season that feels reflective of the show’s creative team working to bring this juggernaut of a story to a satisfying end in just nine short episodes. Especially since it has been three years since season 1, you might need a refresher on how things became so dire for the citizens of Piltover and Zaun. But while the new season drops you right back into the chaos in a somewhat disorienting way, it does an excellent job of weaving together the many different threads of <em>Arcane</em>’s powerful legend.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s first season ended with a literal bang — an explosive attack from Jinx (Ella Purnell) on the elite council members of Piltover just as they were about to sign a peace treaty that would have brought an end to their war on the impoverished people of Zaun. Though Jinx’s attack was rooted in years of personal psychological torment and her growing up as part of Zaun’s abused, disenfranchised underclass, it was a moment that made her sister Vi (Hailee Steinfeld) see truly her as a terroristic monster. It wasn’t clear who might emerge from the smoking rubble in the end, but there was no question about how much harder Piltover would retaliate with its dangerous Hextech weapons.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season picks up in the immediate aftermath of the attack to emphasize the sheer amount of destruction Jinx caused in her crusade to make Piltover pay for its history of injustices. With so many of Piltover’s political leaders dead, the city’s priorities and its balance of power have to shift in ways that feel necessary to Vi and other survivors like enforcer Caitlyn Kiramman (Katie Leung). But while the new season takes some time to make you appreciate the magnitude of Piltover’s loss, it pushes this act of <em>Arcane</em>’s story into motion by exploring how oppressive societies create the monsters they ultimately come to hate and fear.</p><p>Everyone suffers as <em>Arcane </em>moves its characters into a new phase of conflict, but the show uses Vi and Jinx in particular to highlight how profoundly war can unmoor people from their senses of self. It’s easier for the sisters to let one another go than it is for either of them to see themselves in the other’s face. And when presented with chances to channel their feelings into action, it seldom occurs to them how fighting just to hurt the other side is guaranteed to cause self-inflicted wounds.</p><p><em>Arcane </em>repeatedly echoes that idea as it briskly shifts focus to the rest of its cast and brings the devastating danger of Hextech into sharp focus. Inventor Jayce Talis (Kevin Alejandro) and politician Mel Medarda (Toks Olagundoye) can understand the gravity of the escalation her warhawk mother Ambessa (Ellen Thomas) is hungry for. But that foresight can only do so much to keep the calls for a full-on invasion of Zaun at bay.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season uses the rising tension and Jayce’s fears about what he has helped create to delve deeper into the magical mysteries of Hextech with a subplot that zooms far out into new realms of the <em>League of Legends </em>universe. It’s another way the show reinforces its ideas about actions coming with consequences that aren’t immediately obvious up close. And in some of <em>Arcane</em>’s characters, it crystalizes how heavy a price the planet can pay as humanity wages war.</p><p>Hextech also features largely in most of this season’s more visually stunning set pieces, which are once again truly the show’s greatest strength. Though the show as a whole is still utterly gorgeous, the action feels even more brutal this time around. On occasion, the “cool” needle drops feel a bit tone deaf because of how frank <em>Arcane</em> is trying to be in its depiction of a society tearing itself apart. But that has always kinda been <em>Arcane</em>’s vibe, and the season really leaning into it will likely appeal to hardcore fans.</p><p>Because the stakes are even higher and all of <em>Arcane</em>’s players are now fully locked into the war, this season’s first three episodes often feel more narratively dense and like they’re moving at a much faster pace. That might be more exhausting if the season was dropping all at once, but Netflix has smartly chosen to split it up into three separate acts set to debut through the end of the month. We won’t know until the end of November just how <em>Arcane</em>’s creators intend to bring this story to a close and whether it might set the stage for whatever’s coming next for the franchise. But this first act is a strong opener for <em>Arcane</em>’s final chapter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Todd's career in horror, which included a title role in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/candyman">1992's Candyman</a>, earned him a Lifetime Achieveement Award at the New York City Horror Film Festival.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Todd had a starring role in Insomniac's Spider-Man 2, and we spoke to him about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/spider-man-2-tony-todd-on-embodying-the-essence-of-venom">embodying the essence of Venom</a> ahead of last year's release.

Bloody Disgusting Editor in Chief John Squires wrote, "The loss of Tony Todd is a monumental loss for the horror world. One of the all-time greats. We say it a lot. Horror icon. Horror legend. He embodied all of that. Made every movie he was in better. A staple of the convention scene. A true member of this horror family.

If it's charity speed runs you want, then it's charity speed runs you'll get; Awesome Games Done Quick organisers have announced the annual seven-day event will return in January 2025, and its full speedrun schedule is available to peruse now.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 runs from 5th-12th January next year, featuring over 130 speedruns across its duration. And as per its <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">newly released schedule</a>, the line-up is a typically eclectic one, covering everything from triple-A blockbuster titles and indie games to retro classics and other assorted oddities.
</p>
<p>
Proceedings get underway at 4:30pm GMT on Sunday, 5th January, with an introductory pre-amble ahead of an All Parts speedrun of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> on Switch by RayOken. Things then come to a close seven days later with a Map Randomizer Race speedrun of Super Metroid - starring Andy, Eddie, imyt, and Oatsngoats - at 4:10am on Sunday, 12th January.

<p>
Inbetween, there's everything from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a> to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, as well as the traditional Awful Games Done Quick block - which this year kicks off with Superman 64 at 3:24am on Thursday, 9th January, before forging onward with the likes of Golf With Your Grandmother, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, and the superbly named Doronko Wanko. Also of note is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> speedrun on Saturday, 11th January, which will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">accompanied by a live rock band</a> playing renditions of its in-game tunes.
</p><p>
If you're looking to attend Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 in-person, it's being held at the Wyndham Grand in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the second time in a row, and <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzQXKDWWRRbtgZMmlScwxxFHLgbX">registration is now open</a>. Of course, if that's too much of an impractical trek, the whole thing is also being streamed online <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">via the Games Done Quick channel on Twitch</a> as it happens.
</p>
<p>
Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 is once again raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, after this year's event amassed £1.9m for the charity back in January. Its sister event, Summer Games Done Quick 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-games-done-quick-2024-raises-19m-taking-its-lifetime-charitable-total-to-40m">raised £1.9m for Doctors Without Borders</a> in July, taking the organisation's lifetime charitable total to over £40m.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The developer of Deep Regrets has voiced the financial risks of proposed US trade tariffs. The tabletop developer is the first to articulate this major commerce issue facing the entire board game industry, one that can be financially devastating.</p>

<h2>The <em>Deep Regrets</em> Risk Update</h2>

<p>In a recent update on its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tettix/deep-regrets-an-unfortunate-fishing-game/description">Kickstarter page</a>, the developer of <em>Deep Regrets</em>, Judson Cowan, informed backers on game developments. It started with rudimentary updates regarding updates to the pledge manager, issues with declined card payments, and that the manufacturing was officially underway.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-regrets-kickstarter-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=tm_x2zAD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-regrets-kickstarter-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=3mRXx4iX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Then Cowan went into a risk update. Cowan mentions the immediate impact of the recent US election, the victory of former president and convicted criminal Donald Trump. Specifically, the administration would impose trade tariffs on imported products. These tariffs were a highly advertised part of Trump's campaign, though it is a strategy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/tariffs-donald-trump-strategy/index.html">not fully formed</a>.</p>

<p>The impact of these tariffs would devastate the entire board game industry. <em>Deep Regrets</em> is no different. If the tariffs are imposed by the time the game reaches store shelves in February, the price of importing the game to the US could increase by 60%, roughly costing $100,000 more.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that the aim of these trade tariffs is on imported products from China. Roughly 90% of all board game manufacturing happens overseas in China. A potential side effect may mean board game companies will increase their prices to recoup these costs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-regrets-board-screenshot.jpg?itok=67Tbu2Yi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-regrets-board-screenshot.jpg?itok=jf_woPOv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This won't affect how customers receive <em>Deep Regrets</em>, Cowan has restated he will do everything possible to ensure US backers get their copy of the game. However, Cowan remakes that the tariffs may potentially affect his ability to sell board games in the US, or even continue to make and sell board games period.</p>

<p>This will not be the last time such stories will occur in the tabletop industry. Amongst the many geopolitical, sociologically, and economic ramifications of a second Trump presidential terms, one of them maybe higher costs for board game experiences across the board. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> cards, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a> miniatures, and potentially TTRPG books.</p>

CAPITALISM IS CANCER! MY CHANNEL IS BEING DELETED FOR SHARING GAMEPLAY VIDEOS! THIS IS YOUR REWARD!” Keighin wrote in one of his posts. If you haven’t heard of him before now, it’s probably because his social media accounts were small, and his reach was very, very limited. It certainly <em>seems</em> like his ongoing defiance of the Switch maker led the company to try and make an example out of him.

<p>You need money. We all need money, but we’ll have to settle for virtual cash in a game like Planet Coaster 2. At least in that world, you have total control and can plop down an entire roller coaster in your backyard. I tried that once, and the city sent a zoning expert to shut everything down. Anyway, you can earn more money in Planet Coaster 2, and I’d like to help your amusement park flourish with a few tips!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-ways-to-make-more-money-in-planet-coaster-2">Best Ways to Make More Money in Planet Coaster 2</h2>



<p>Without a constant and ever-growing source of income, you can’t reinvest in your park to open additional rides, like rollercoasters and carousels, or expand your offerings to the new waterpark mechanics. But earning more money in Planet Coaster 2 is easier said than done, right? Nope, here are a few tips:</p>



<h3 id="h-lower-the-entry-fee-to-free">Lower the Entry Fee to Free</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>First and foremost, open up your Park Management screen. It’s the top-most icon on the top left-hand side of the screen. Here, you can alter your Park Options, including the price of admission for the various ticket and pass types in the game.</p>



<p>Here, I recommend lowering your entry tickets to $0.00. That’s right; allow everyone free entry to your for-profit amusement park. Doing so will entice more visitors to check out your park, where you stand to make money. With the ticket prices free, people can spend more on drinks, food, merchandise, and the rides themselves. Jack up those prices, baby!</p>



<h3 id="h-add-scenery-to-rides">Add Scenery to Rides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Don’t forget about the scenery as you expand your park, plopping down a new ride or two along your most recent expansion. It’s easy to ignore scenery, as everything little bit costs money. It’ll feel as if you’re hemorrhaging money initially. But trust me when I tell you it’s an investment with long-term gains.</p>



<p>The scenery in Planet Coaster 2 directly increases ride and park appeal, which increases the Prestige of your attractions. As appeal and Prestige increase, so does guest happiness. They’ll spend more time at your park, riding the rides and buying merchandise, making you money.</p>



<h3 id="h-relax">Relax!</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I like to watch whatever show I’m binging while playing a game like Planet Coaster 2. Inevitably, you still encounter slow periods of gameplay where it’s often best to sit back and relax. For instance, once you’re profitable, with a handful of rides and attractions bringing in customers, speed up the game and chill.</p>



<p>Now’s a good time to catch up on Reddit, read a chapter in your book, or catch a few moments of your favorite show while your park works in the background, constantly ticking up those dollar signs with every passing second.</p>

So far, there are <em>twelve</em>, and it’s absolutely bewildering.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,195752" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Free-to-play games having multiple currencies is, again, nothing new, and it’s all by design, all a part of the psychological systems to have you desperate to top things up, keep things ticking, and if you can <em>just</em> get three more of these, then a whole other thing unlocks! And, again, the big issue here is that this is <em>Pokémon</em> doing it to an audience with a huge proportion of children, and indeed delivering it in the most byzantine way imaginable.</p><p>To discover just how bonkers this all is, on the game’s main page, there’s a button on the bottom-right with three lines. Tap that, and there’s an option below “Shop” called “Items.” Click on this innocuous little word, and the lunacy is revealed.</p><p>Let’s lay it all out:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Poké gold (non-paid)</li><li>Poké gold (paid)</li><li>Shinedust</li><li>Shop ticket</li><li>Special shop ticket</li><li>Premium ticket</li><li>Pack Hourglass</li><li>Wonder Hourglass</li><li>Event Hourglass</li><li>Advance Ticket</li><li>Event Shop Ticket (Meowth)</li><li>Emblem Ticket (Genetic Apex)</li><li>Rewind Watch</li></ul><p>Now, we’re being generous here, including the two types of gold as one to get to that total of 12. And if your list doesn’t have that many, that’s because you currently don’t own any of them. It’s a list that just keeps expanding, and given the specificity of the Event Shop Ticket and Emblem Ticket, we must assume that there are other types of these to come.</p><p>You might expect me here to go through explaining what each type does, but you know what? Not even The Pokémon Company seems willing to share that. That Advance Ticket’s entry reads, “This ticket cannot be used yet. Wait and see what it’s for!”</p><p>Um, no? Just tell me? It’s already annoying enough as it is.</p><figure id="" data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of these currencies are used to buy items from specific pages of the game’s shop, which itself is laid out as if it got caught in one of those Doctor Strange spells where all the buildings and train tracks start spinning and weaving inside one another. To spend the Event Shop Ticket (Meowth), you need to go to the “Limited Time / Events” section of the shop, and then to the Event page within that, as distinct from the Premium page, Poké gold page, and the mysterious and always-empty “Other.” There’s another Other in the “Main” section of the shop, which is also empty! Is it empty of the same things? No one knows!</p><p>Special Shop Tickets are gained when you sacrifice multiple versions of full-art or better cards, which the game never explains at any point, and require you to have somehow gathered three or more of the same incredibly rare art. We’re talking about cards with a 0.3 percent (or worse, getting as low as 0.013 percent) chance of coming out of a pack here. You get <em>one</em> of those per card (I know, because infuriatingly I’ve somehow pulled three of the gorgeous Snorlax full-art card), and the cheapest item in this shop costs <em>seven</em> Special Shop Tickets. That’s for the presentation backgrounds, rather than the fancy black-and-silver sleeves, playmat or coin you might want—they cost 12 tickets each!</p><p>Oh wait! Hang on! It <em>is</em> thirteen currencies, because I completely forgot to include Pack Points! Yeah, there’s yet another system that it doesn’t even bother to remember when listing what you own. These are the points you can use to exchange for cards you might want in your deck, gained by opening packs, and only appearing—not when you’re building packs or on any of the card screens—but when you’re on the page to select a new sealed pack to open...</p><p>WHO LET ANY OF THIS HAPPEN?!</p><p>I have to stop writing now, in case I discover a fourteenth currency I’d not seen before now and have an aneurysm.</p><p>And why is it like this? To deliberately confuse you. To make sure you’re never certain which currency is one you should be holding onto and which is one that has no other purpose than to be spent there and then. And to constantly dangle numbers in front of you that could get higher if only you bought just a teensy bit of gold. Some directly, like hourglasses, where shortages can be made up by subbing in gold you own; others indirectly by only arriving if you buy the (abysmal) Premium Pass, or won by continuing playing that Event where you just ran out of hourglasses...</p><p>Next time, the <em>eight</em> different pages of Missions!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
