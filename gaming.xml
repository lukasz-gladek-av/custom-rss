		<p>Maze Theory has announced that Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows will be launching on December 4th, and the studio has released two gameplay videos. One shows Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows running on PSVR 2, while the other shows it running on Meta Quest. It is the same sequence for both, but if you want to compare you can watch both videos below.</p>

<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says,&nbsp;<em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>In a blog post on the PlayStation blog website Steven Gallagher (Creative Director at Eidos-Montréal), that this was not the first attempt at doing a Thief game in VR. He said, <em>“Towards the end of Thief (2014), Eidos-Montréal tried creating their own playable VR demo as part of Sony’s Project Morpheus, the first iteration of PlayStation VR”, Steven reveals. “Unfortunately, we weren’t particularly experienced in making VR back then, so the overall product ended up being a bit hard to play.”</em></p>

<p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow will feature non-linear levels so players have quite a lot of freedom in how to tackle the scenarios they find themselves in. Stealth and sneakily taking things are the main ways of success as combat is not going to be your strong point. Players will need to carefully plan routes and actions to pull of the heists properly.</p>

<p>And that fps might explain why</p>

<figure data-uuid="f94d289e8ff53"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2 Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f94d289e8ff53/animal-crossing-switch-2-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The prices have been revealed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and its upgrade pack, and they are slightly lower than you might have expected.</p>
<p>As listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950861.html">Switch eShop</a>, the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is now available to pre-order for <strong>£54.99 / $64.99</strong>, while the upgrade pack is a measly <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Just in case the headline wasn't enough of a giveaway, that's the cheapest Switch 2 Edition we've seen from Nintendo.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> set you back £58.99 / $69.99 for the Switch 2 Edition or £7.99 / $9.99 for the upgrade path. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> were £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 on new hardware, and while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s upgrades were available for free to NSO subscribers, those who weren't signed up had to pay £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 for the full next gen experience.</p>
<p>In short, Animal Crossing is a fair bit cheaper than we would have initially expected. But then, when we think about it, perhaps we should have expected exactly this. ACNH makes for a nice Switch 2 package, with Mouse Mode integration, improved resolutions and GameChat features to boot, but the whole thing feels a little slight compared to other S2 upgrades, no?</p>
<p>The frame rate, for example, remains at 30fps — the first Switch 2 Edition to not contain a boost in this department. There's a fresh Megaphone item, but almost all of the new content is tied to the ver. 3.0 update, which is coming to Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Compare that to Kirby or Mario Party, where the upgrades contained new modes and levels, and the reduced price makes a little more sense.</p>
<p>So, are we pleased that New Horizons isn't quite as expensive as the NS2 Editions that have come before it? Yes we are. But can we see why? Hmmm, probably.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-new-controller-is-really-good-but-broke-my-brain.1339642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last month, I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyperkin-x91-retro-controller-review-past-imperfect-1793539025">Hyperkin</a>‘s new Competitor controller. This wired gamepad is an officially licensed Xbox controller that is designed to look and feel like a PlayStation 5 controller. And it’s a great controller, but holy crap does it break my brain when I use it.</p> <p>Out now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-controller-ps5-hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-price-1851733419">Hyperkin’s new Competitor controller costs $50</a> and is a damn fine gamepad. It features super-smooth and responsive Hall Effect joysticks, so stick drift shouldn’t be a problem anytime soon, and it has Xbox-like Impulse Triggers that rumble as you’d expect. This wired controller is incredibly well built and feels great to use. Heck, it feels really good just to hold. It’s the kind of gamepad that makes you want to play something when you pick it up. Buttons are responsive, too, though I’m not a huge fan of the menu and view buttons. They’re too slim in profile and can be easy to miss when first using the controller and blindly sliding your thumbs around.</p>

 <p>The Competitor sports some extras that a standard Xbox gamepad lacks, like two back buttons located on the rear of the gamepad’s long, textured grips. These can be programmed in supporting games, letting you assign reload or jump or other actions to these extra inputs. The back buttons can also be locked so you don’t accidentally use them, a feature I appreciate as I don’t normally engage with back paddles.</p>

 <p>The big difference between this and most other Xbox controllers is that it’s built to feel like a PS5 DualSense. The sticks are symmetrical, the d-pad feels ripped right off a Dualsense, and even the shape is a close-to-perfect match for Sony’s controller. If you’re someone who is more comfortable using a PlayStation controller, but you also own an Xbox Series X/S, the Competitor is designed specifically for you.</p>

 <h2>Plays great, feels weird</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640206"><em>The Hyperkin Competitor (black and white) next to my PS5 gamepad (black) and my trippy-looking Xbox controller.</em> ©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Overall, this is a fantastic controller that worked perfectly on my PC as well as my Xbox Series X. But actually using this controller to play games broke my brain. I didn’t realize until I started playing around with the Competitor how hardwired my brain is when it comes to controllers.</p>

 <p>Holding this thing, my brain wants to treat it like a PlayStation controller, yet the Xbox button prompts don’t match up with what my brain <em>thinks</em> I’m holding. I’d go to press the DualSense’s touchpad to open a menu and find nothing but barren plastic. It was like rubbing my stomach while tapping my head with a different hand. I could use the Competitor, but only if I thought about it, and even then, I’d make mistakes.</p> <p>I imagine for folks who prefer PlayStation controllers, this won’t be a problem. They’ll plug this into their Xbox and never look back. But as someone who hops between Xbox and PlayStation a lot, this controller really screwed with me. That’s not the controller’s fault. That’s my brain being weird. For most people, this won’t be a problem. And for $50, the Competitor is a solid, well-made Xbox or PC controller that will likely last you years if you take care of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Developer Heart Machine has laid off more employees, just weeks before the launch of its next game. According to a number of now former employees, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker and the upcoming Possessor(s) has let them go ahead of the latter’s November 11th launch.</p>



<p>Based on social media posts, the layoffs took place on October 28 and 29. </p>



<p><strong>“I just wanted to post, I’m laid off,”</strong> said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burnrate.bsky.social/post/3m4bqa3s5is26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one impacted employee</a>. <strong>“Just shouting into the void of the internet! It was a beautiful and wonderful team of people to work with at HM.”</strong></p>



<p>Another said that their time with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company will end</a> after Possessor(s) launches while Community and PR Manager Yiyi Zhang actually posted a video about the cuts.</p>



<p><strong>“Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately,”</strong> she said. <strong>“And by the time&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;comes out on November 11, I don’t know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore. That’s game dev.”</strong></p>



<p>The latest round of layoffs comes just two weeks after Heart Machine said it was letting go of staff and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyper-light-breaker-developers-ending-development-and-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winding down development </a>of Hyper Light Breaker.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Heart Machine for clarification on the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think about the second round of layoffs at Heart Machine in a month? Do you think the studio will last much longer?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokémon Legends Z-A Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Previously, the expectation was that you could only earn one Mega Stone for one of the three aforementioned Pokemon per season. The first season for Pokémon Legends: Z-A featured Greninjite as the reward for reaching rank K (the game starts at rank Z and tops at A).</p><p>But with the second season starting on Wednesday, November 5, at 10 PM PT/1 AM ET, those who missed getting Greninja's Mega Stone can win it by only leveling up once to rank Y, and Delphoxite will be rewarded at the lower rank of S. That's eight ranks lower than the prior season's requirement.</p><p>Should subsequent seasons follow this model, expect Chesnaughtite to be the Season 3 reward. <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/10.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Pokemon Company also confirmed on its website</a> that the game will adjust points awarded and increase battle rewards after matches.</p><p>It's not a perfect solution, as players will still be required to participate in online matches (which requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription) to obtain these Mega Stones that could have just been part of the base game.</p><p>Additionally, a <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/9.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch scheduled for some time in November</a> will address two issues that affect progression in the story. One prevents players from obtaining or catching any new Pokemon if their storage boxes are full before a certain story mission, and another is a glitch that can occur when the game transitions between day and night.</p><p>These changes and fixes to Pokemon Legends: Z-A will come after a largely successful launch for the game, which had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-the-biggest-physical-game-launch-in-years-in-us/1100-6535737/" data-ref-id="1100-6535737">massive launch in retailers</a>. The monster-catching game is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-paid-dlc-and-two-shocking-new-mega-evolutions/1100-6534700/" data-ref-id="1100-6534700">getting paid DLC</a> that will include some new Mega Evolutions.</p>

		<p>Team Peak has revealed that next week on November 5th it will be updating Peak and adding a new biome for players. That biome has been called Roots and from the brief teaser it looks like there will be tree climbing involved, and possibly spiders grabbing players. You can check out the short look at the Roots biome in the teaser below.</p>

			<p>While EA is all-in on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> right now after it had a massive launch at the beginning of October and earlier this week launched its battle royale mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield REDSEC</a>, Respawn is still chugging away at Apex Legends, with its 27th season set to arrive next week, titled 'Amped.'</p>



<p>The new season arrives with a refresh to one of the game's more popular maps, Olympus, and buffs for a few Legends, specifically Valkyrie, Rampart, and Horizon. This season also adds new mechanics that'll make the game even faster than it already is, with a new mantle boost giving players a speed boost on wall-bounces and mantling over ledges.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shows off the new mantle mechanics while featuring the aforementioned legends, and of course, the new refresh for Olympus, titled Olympus: Rising, is also heavily showcased.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Apex Legends: Amped Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkLtbMz5uz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding buffs for Valkyrie, her VTOL jets are getting a speed boost, while her missile swarm no longer does any self-damage, nor does it have height restrictions. It also scans enemies hit with the swarrm and places a cooldown on movement passive abilities. Her Skyward Dive also has a shorter takeoff time.</p>



<p>For Rampart, her Amped Cover walls gain health with Evo increases and even include a roof. For Horizon, her Gravity Lift cooldown time has been reduced, while her Black Hole ability now gains even more health.</p>



<p>For all legends, the mantle boost gives players a speed boost for wall and ledge bounces, and the Trident now has improved collision and its own dedicated health bar.</p>



<p>In all the hullabaloo of Battlefield 6, it's easy to lose Apex Legends in the mix. That said, it's consistently stayed above <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/#1y">150K concurrent players on Steam this year</a>, only dipping below that figure a handful of times. There's no denying that it's still popular, and its longevity is not to be dismissed, as few live service games make it to their 27th season. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Revenue Still in Freefall, Microsoft Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-hardware-revenue-q1-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-revenue-still-in-freefall-microsoft-reveals.1339597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its first-quarter fiscal results for the 2025-26 financial year, and Xbox consoles appear to be continuing their sales freefall, although "content and services" revenue is up.</p>

<p>In the company's latest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/more-personal-computing-performance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial release</a>, Microsoft says its Xbox hardware revenue has dropped by 29% when compared to the same period last year, and given that Xbox hardware sales have been in decline for a while now, that's not good news for the gaming division.</p>

<p>There's a silver lining for Microsoft, though, albeit a very small one; content and services revenue, which includes the company's Game Pass service as well as gaming-related software, increased by (an admittedly paltry) 1%, driven by "growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=Nf1aQZo1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=KeapOShe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass continues to grow, albeit slowly.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the first quarter of Microsoft's fiscal year covers the period between June and September, so it doesn't take into account the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">controversial Game Pass changes</a> introduced earlier this month, which saw the price of top tier Ultimate jump to $30 per month.</p>

<p>The data also won't include major Xbox releases for the end of the year, like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, the latter of which will almost certainly boost sales in the coming second quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Xbox's continuing console woes don't appear to be deterring the company from continuing to pursue hardware development, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors" rel="nofollow">at least not officially</a>; it's been confirmed that there will be a next-generation Xbox console, and that it's being developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">in conjunction with tech company AMD</a>.</p>

<p>Despite that, Xbox is currently chasing a multi-platform strategy, with major releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">Halo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War</a>&nbsp;</em>no longer confined to Xbox consoles. That's unlikely to change, even when Xbox does eventually release its next machine.</p>




<p>This data also doesn't take into account the newly-released ROG Xbox Ally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">handhelds</a>, although whether they'll be enough to tip the scales and reverse the company's woeful hardware performance is unclear.</p>

<p>Things are looking a little rosier for Microsoft as a whole, however; the software giant <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> a revenue increase of 18%, which I'm sure will soothe the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">thousands of employees who lost their jobs</a> during the company's latest round of layoffs.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/panic-stations-fall-guys-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fall-guys-veterans-form-new-uk-based-studio-panic-stations.1339591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developers, including one of developer Mediatonic's co-founders, have banded together to create a brand new UK-based studio called Panic Stations, and they're already hard at work on their first game.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Panic Stations' staffers include&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>designers Dan Hoang and Joe Walsh (no, not that one), as well as social and community lead Oliver Hindle, who shaped&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' "distinctive voice and viral presence" online.</p>

<p>They're joined by Mediatonic co-founder Paul Croft, who, along with Josh Tarrant, is also one of the founders of new indie development collective Skeleton Crew (not to be confused with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key</a>).</p>

<p>Panic Stations is already hard at work on its first game, it seems; the studio says it will announce its debut project "soon", so we shouldn't have too much longer to wait before we know whether this new UK outfit is aiming to take on&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' crown (as it were).</p>

<p>Whatever Panic Stations is working on, it sounds like it'll be an online offering; founder Paul Croft says he's a "huge fan of the online co-op space" and that he wants to make games that "bring people closer together".</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer announcing Panic Stations' formation, which takes the form of a sort of pigeon-based mockumentary, right here. It's very characteristic of the founders' humor, I think.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what Panic Stations comes up with, but in the meantime, if you're jonesing for some physics-y multiplayer fun, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>and its ranked mode, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout" rel="nofollow">launched back in April last year</a>.</p>

            <p>Onion Games have released the English language version of Stray Children, a "bittersweet, fairytale RPG" I hadn't heard of till Oisin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stray-children-the-oddball-rpg-from-the-devs-behind-cult-classic-moon-is-coming-to-pc-in-english-later-this-year">wrote it up in June</a>, and then became very excited about. 
</p>
<p>Created by Onion Games, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moon-remix-rpg-adventure">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>, Stray Children takes place in a world of kids besieged by monstrous adults. The kids live in a stronghold, while the adults, aka Olders, roam the landscapes beyond, each "carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and all of the grievances that grown-ups gather".</p> <!--more-->
<p>So... not a game I will play with my nephew, then. Not until he's 40, when I will hopefully be dead. It looks amazing, though: eerie and fizzy and a little depraved. There are treehouses and submarines and Icicle Bullets of Love. Here's a trailer.
</p>

<p>As every child knows, it can be difficult to defeat grown-ups through force of arms. You may find it more effective to talk to them, surgically targeting their psychic vulnerabilities with phrases like "do you remember having hair" and "nobody remembers that thing you like". As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, you can talk to opponents in Stray Children to trigger various responses and overcome their defences.</p><p>Also as in Undertale, the battle system is a mix of turn-based and shmuppy, with players darting out of the path of various weaponised metaphors. What do the squealing piglets stand for? I am going to say: somebody's inability to deal with the fact that they never mastered the clarinet.
</p>
<p>"Deftly dodge the relentless barrage of their bottled-up emotions, and discover the source of their strange stories," encourages <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3649490/Stray_Children/">the Steam page</a>. "By touching their heart with your words, you might just be able to save their souls." The Steam blurb concludes with a moderately atypical plea from the dev. "We hope you'll have fun discovering all the secrets of Stray Children, but we have one final request for anyone and everyone who finishes the game: please keep the ending a secret!"
</p><p>
While Moon: Remix RPG Adventure was a re-release of Love-de-Lic's anti-RPG Moon from 1997 - one of the major influences on Toby Fox's Undertale, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cult-90s-rpg-and-undertale-inspiration-moon-remix-rpg-adventure-is-headed-to-pc">caveat</a> that he never actually played it beforehand - Stray Children is a new project from Onion Games director and game designer Yoshiro Kimura, whose credits include Romancing SaGa 2 and Rule of Rose.
</p><p>The Tokyo-based studio's other members include art director Kurashima Kazuyuki, who worked on Live A Live and Super Mario RPG, and composer and sound designer Hirofumi Taniguchi, who did music for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/contra">Contra</a>: Hard Corps. In short: pedigree.</p>
<p>I'd love to include some hands-on impressions, but I've just seen this pop up on my feed. I've read three launch Steam reviews, which are as follows: "Undertale but heterosexual", "heterosexual but Undertale", and then, an actual review from a self-described bug tester who comments that Stray Children shouldn't be compared too avidly to either Moon or Undertale. It certainly looks like a world of its own.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter power outages seem to pick the worst times to strike, such as during holiday gatherings of friends or when you are hosting game night in your living room. Portable power stations solve this anxiety by keeping your most-used devices running when the grid goes down, and EcoFlow has launched its Black Friday deals with aggressive pricing that makes premium backup power surprisingly affordable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic has been cut from $599 down to just $399</a>, which undercuts even budget gas generators while d<strong>elivering 1800 watts of clean, silent power without fumes or maintenance headaches</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Electric Power</h2>
<p>The <strong>continuous 1800-watt output</strong> is ready to power refrigerators, microwaves, laptops and space heaters and do that for several devices at the same time in case of outages. That <strong>3600-watt surge capacity handles the surge in power</strong> that happens when things like refrigerator compressors kick in to prevent tripping or shutdowns when your refrigerator compressor comes on. It offer <strong>two USB-C ports (100W and 30W), one USB-C port and three AC outputs</strong>.</p>



<p>The 1024 Wh LiFePO4 battery offers ample capacity to <strong>run a typical refrigerator for around 12 to 15 hours</strong> and keep your food from spoiling during extended blackouts. This automotive-grade battery chemistry offers superior safety and longevity, compared to standard lithium-ion cells, retaining more than 80% of its original capacity even after 4000 complete charge cycles. That’s <strong>more than 10 years of use daily</strong> which makes this a lifetime investment rather than a disposable emergency tool.</p>
<p>X-Stream Fast Charging Technology provides <strong>charging from completely dead to 80% capacity in as little as 45 minutes</strong> with a standard wall outlet. That kind of speed is critical when weather forecasts predict an incoming storm and you have forgotten to keep your battery topped up. The system intelligently identifies the optimal voltage and current to maximize charging speed, and avoids battery degradation that many cheaper units with aggressive charging profiles suffer from.</p>



<p>A <strong>UPS switching time of less than 10 milliseconds safeguards desktop computers, servers, NAS systems</strong> and medical equipment against power interruptions. This near-instant transition happens so fast that most electronics won’t be able to detect the changeover, thus preventing data loss, system crashes or disrupted medical treatments. The pure sine wave output provides grid-quality power, just like what’s coming out of your wall outlets, to ensure sensitive electronics get clean electricity free of voltage fluctuations that can burn out circuit boards.</p>
<p>The cell-to-chassis construction design shields the battery from drops, bumps, and transport vibrations that would destroy loosely mounted cells. This automotive-inspired structural approach insulates the battery cells from external impacts, improving thermal management by direct contact with the chassis. The unit operates reliably in temperatures from freezing cold to scorching heat, handles 95% humidity levels and resists 5% salt spray which makes it perfect for coastal areas and harsh environments where cheaper power stations just don’t cut it.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $599, this Black Friday deal undercuts the price of budget gas generators and delivers superior convenience, safety, and long-term value in return.</p>

<p>A new rumour states that Valve may have begun work on a Half-Life 3 trailer. </p>



<p>Valve has been utterly silent about the next instalment to the Half-Life series, with only rumours, datamines, and leaks being our only source of information. Most recently, we heard that the upcoming title was being developed as the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-has-been-designed-to-be-the-final-chapter-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final chapter</a>‘ of the franchise. Now, a new rumour states that a trailer for HLX/HL3 is already in the works. </p>



<h2 id="h-half-life-3-s-announcement-and-launch-will-be-very-close-to-each-other-it-s-claimed">Half-Life 3’s Announcement And Launch Will Be Very Close to Each Other, It’s Claimed</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding Valve’s work on Half-Life 3’s trailer comes from Tyler McVicker’s latest HLX Files episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKR-G1EuYyg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. McVicker says that the “current rumour that’s going around is that work on the trailer is occurring.” McVicker added that Valve’s approach to trailers is very different from “publicly-owned triple-A studios'” approach.</p>



<p>The video also mentioned that trailers and announcements typically arrive close to a year before launch. However, “Valve is not doing that.” Players are going to get Half-Life 3’s announcement and launch “very close together”, similar to what they saw with Half-Life Alyx.</p>



<p>McVicker explains that when trailers are created for games that are still far from launch, developers “have to effectively fake” what is being showcased, with very specific scripted content being pushed to the finish line earlier than the rest of the game’s aspects. </p>



<p>However, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it was not obtained through a data leak or datamine, and Valve has not officially announced anything. </p>

		<p>Football Manager 26 gives the impression of a youngster being given their first senior debut for a big club, stepping into the public eye looking to take the reins from the old guard. It is a new chapter for Sports Interactive’s long running series with a leap to a new game engine and a shift in how it is presented to players. After quite a few hours playing through Football Manager 26, it is a game that shows some promise, but needs a lot of long term updates and changes before it is ready to be considered a successful switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | First Look Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cDQi5kwuHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The caveat is that currently Football Manager 26 is considered to be in beta ahead of its official 4th November release, with Sports Interactive releasing regular fixes and updates through this window. That said, Football Manager 26 is clearly a very different experience to the Football Manager games that came before.</p>


<p>A new user interface comes with different tiles and cards you can click on to get more information, there’s a change in the matchday presentation, removal of touchline shouts, removal of gestures for team talks and press conferences, and a delayed release for international management to line up with next year’s World Cup. A positive addition is the long-awaited introduction of women’s leagues as well as new nation leagues that expand the database.</p>


<p>The user interface takes getting used to with a change to menus and the amount of data that is presented to you, split across tabs like the top level Portal, Recruitment, Matchday, Squad, and Club. Within each tab various tiles present information like league position, performance, finances or whatever else you want to look up. While it does look modern, it will take a while to get used to and retrain the muscle memory after so many years of the Football Manager UI being relatively stable. While there is a lot of information, it can be quite overwhelming to find what you need quickly and needing to keep clicking to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Information could be much clearly presented too. News stories are not shown in detail when you open a message in the portal, instead needing to click on it to see the full details. It was much clearer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/football-manager-2024-review/">Football Manager 24</a>. When it comes to the matchday experience player fitness levels are much harder to read. Where FM24 had big and bold player tiles easily showing the information, the same information is more compact in FM26, and it is not as easy on the eye. This goes for spotting injuries during matches and player skill levels as well. At one point a player was injured who needed subbing off, but it was not clear looking at the tactics screen who I was needing to hook off the pitch.</p>

<p>The change extends to the general tactics screen. Sports Interactive wants players to get a lot more detail when it comes to sorting tactics and there is a depth of information. With tactics you now don’t just select a playstyle, a couple of formations to train, set instructions, and slot your players in. Now, formations are split into in possession and out of possession, so you can set two different tactical approaches to deal with different opponents. It is a good idea to really develop your team and reflects more of how modern teams approach different game states, but there are issues in just moving players and positions around. Swapping players either lags or sometimes does not happen as intended, and trying to adjust positions is not as smooth as in previous instalments.</p>

<p>What is clear right now is that Football Manager 26, in this current stage at least, is the first step of a new era. Much like the start of any new era that comes with a challenge of rebuilding and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better, but with what I have played so far I do not think this is going to be the entry that will hit the potential of what the switch to the new engine and implementation of new features can bring. In my view, it may take one or two more years for the rebuild to really meet its potential.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't feature any of the additional content found in the War of the Lions release and the mobile versions of the game, but this could quickly become a thing of the past, as a new mod now available online restores a small portion of this additional content.</p>



<p>The WotL Character Repair mod, developed by Dana Crysalis and now available for download for free from Nexus Mods, fixes Balthier and Luso, making it possible to add them to the party via Cheat Engine tables and use them in battle with their unique Jobs and ability sets. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there's no way to add the two characters to the game without using Cheat Engine due to how difficult it currently is to add new events to the game. Installation requires using the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/tag/1.29.2">Reloaded-II loader</a>, which can be less intuitive than just dropping some files into an installation folder.  Still, these are only minor inconveniences, considering the value of the mod.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-The-Ivalice-Chronicles-Balthier-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Balthier and Lus</em><em>o</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> are now fully functional in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles thanks to this new mod</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Curious to see how well this new Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles mod works, I briefly tested it and can confirm that it indeed works as intended. I was able to add both Balthier and Luso to a battle party and use them as if they were a regular vanilla unit, which is not possible to do without this Repair mod, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-war-of-the-lions-content/">as my previous attempts testify</a>. Hopefully, more fixes will come for the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs to make them usable and further expand the game's content.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not the definitive version of the popular tactical role-playing game, lacking the aforementioned War of the Lions content, this new release is more than worth playing thanks to the many improvements it brings. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">You can learn more about them by checking out my review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s getting more expensive to fill my <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251">Halloween trick-or-treat bowl</a> each year as the bags at the store get pricier but smaller. First Trump <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-take-egg-meme-explained">took egg</a>. Then he <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">took video game</a>. Now he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-kid-trick-or-treaters-you-have-no-weight-n815196">take candy</a>.</p> <p>I normally wait until the last minute to pick up candy for Halloween. This entails going to the supermarket during my lunch break on Halloween only to find that all of the Halloween-themed bags have already been replaced with Christmas ones. This usually leaves me with no option but to buy the only candy that normally comes individually wrapped in bulk: blow-pops and stacks and stacks of fun-sized chocolate bars. Beggars can’t be choosers. I pay whatever the Halloween gods demand. No child will leave my house emptyhanded on All Hallows’ Eve.</p> <p>This year I broke with tradition and headed to the supermarket a few nights ahead of time. The pickings were still slim but not altogether terrible. The prices, on the other hand, stopped me in my tracks. It was supposed to be a quick shop. In and out. Instead, I stared at the bags of Snickers and Reece’s Cups like I was picking which arm to get amputated. A big bag of assorted Hershey’s candy was almost $17. That couldn’t be right. I checked again. Ouch. I went for a small bag of Butterfingers. It was $6.59. That would not be nearly enough. Five smaller bags or two bigger ones? Either way, I was getting hosed.</p>

   <p>The irony, of course, is that I do not need nearly this much candy. I always have a ton left over, sitting in the bowl and rotting my teeth through mid-November. But what if this year is different? What if busses of children roll up to my street demanding dispensation? Better safe than sorry. And so I pay to subsidize the fat cats at Mars and Hershey. Apparently I have it easy. One particularly grim thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inflation/comments/1oiotkg/has_anyone_noticed_the_cost_of_the_halloween/">the inflation subreddit</a> tells a different story.</p>

 <p>“I just spent $95 on 4 small bags of candy bar minis (110 mini pieces per bag), and 1 bag of jolly rancher gummy minis that will not get me through the night,” it reads. Some say they’ll just hide in their bedrooms that night watching TV with the lights out. Others are downgrading to cheaper candy. “Stopped doing chocolate and candy bars as that is where inflation is taking the biggest hit,” one person wrote. “Gummy and hard candies are still reasonable. $16 got us like 80 small packs of sour patch kids and when there are gone, they’re gone. Lights out. No more.”</p>

 <h2>Tariffs and bad cocoa harvests</h2> <p>Is candy actually getting way more expensive? Why yes, yes it is. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">NBC News reports</a> that multiple years of bad cocoa harvests in regions like West Africa, due in part to rising temperatures and changing climate conditions, have created a shortage that’s led to skyrocketing prices. “The cost of chocolate has surged nearly 30% since last Halloween,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/halloween-candy-hauls-shrink-chocolate-swapped-cheaper-alternatives">reports Fox News</a>.</p>

 <p>But gummies and other non-chocolate candy is also up. “General manufacturing costs for candy makers, including energy, labor and transportation, have risen 37 percent since early 2024,” one supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">told NBC News</a>. One TikTok deal hunter told the outlet that her normal go-to discount tricks have still gone from $1.50 a bag to $2.50 in some cases this year.</p>   <p>And of course there’s the Trump tariff factor. “The tariffs have hit every single piece of what goes into every single thing,” a small chocolate business owner in North Carolina <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/business/why-halloween-candy-is-getting-more-expensive-and-less-chocolate-y">told CNN</a>. “There is no new normal.” As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/halloween-candy-prices-trump-tariffs-climate-change"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a>, “Donald Trump has placed tariffs on the biggest exporters of chocolate to the US. Imports from the Ivory Coast, the largest producer of cocoa, are taxed with a 21 percent tariff. Ecuador, the second-largest producer, faces a 15 percent tariff.” Prices of Tootsie Roll lollipops alone are up 30 percent on average this year, according to a recent report <a href="https://tcf.org/content/commentary/tricks-treats-and-tariffs-how-trump-is-making-halloween-more-expensive/">by The Century Foundation</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the cruelest part of all of this is that amid the current government shutdown, the Trump administration is set to let SNAP food benefits for the poorest Americans run out on November 1, the day after Halloween. Anyone on food assistance this week is stuck salvaging every penny they can instead of splurging on some candy for the neighborhood kids or their own. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/millions-face-food-aid-cliff-us-government-shutdown-standoff-2025-10-29/">The program currently has</a> access to $5.5 billion in reserve funds that Republicans are refusing to spend as they hold families hostage in negotiations with Democrats.</p>  <p>What Trump take, others can give back. You can <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank">search your area for a local food bank</a> to donate to. If you can afford it, try matching the funds you spend on candy this Halloween for food assistance in your region.</p>

We were there when you set foot on forsaken sands filled with lost secrets and hidden dangers. We were there when you discovered the untamed wilds filled with beasts and verdant jungles. We were there when you crept into the dark heart of lands filled with opulence, madness, and terror.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Through it all, we watched. We delighted. We reveled in your enjoyment of every perfect moment, every carefully crafted story, and we even bore witness to the joining of two souls who met here in Aeternum.
