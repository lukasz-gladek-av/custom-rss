                <p>Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has commented on what impact, if any, there might be on the video game industry due to growing concerns about the global economy due to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's latest investor briefing</a>, Wilson said he's personally witnessed many "twists and turns in the macro environment" in his 25 years with EA. In that time, he's learned that EA and its core franchises have remained "incredibly resilient through macro-challenging times."</p><p>The reason for this, Wilson said, is that he believes "entertainment is a fundamental human need."</p><p>"At this point in time, our form of entertainment is the first form of entertainment for much of the global population, and that grows every year as our industry continues to grow, and we represent incredible value," he said.</p><p>Wilson went on to say video games, despite growing costs, represent "incredible value" relative to other things that people can spend money on.</p><p>"While we are always prudent and pragmatic and thoughtful as we navigate macro uncertainty, we do believe that if we continue to deliver incredible entertainment experiences, we continue to invest behind our biggest franchises that remember, aren't just about entertainment, but are also about connection," he said. "This is where people spend their best time with their best friends where they connect with them every day to enjoy their best moments of the day that even in a world where we may not be immune from a meaningful macroeconomic downtime, we do believe that we will be resilient and we do believe that we can grow over the course of time through that."</p><p>Wilson also pushed back against the idea that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">EA might raise game prices to $80</a>, following Nintendo and Xbox. He said the business today is very different from what it was a decade ago when core revenue streams came from selling discs on shelves. That's still part of EA's business, but it's significantly smaller. Today, EA has multiple other revenue streams, including microtransaction-based free-to-play games and more expensive deluxe editions for games that help offset growing production costs.</p><p>"Our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow," he said.</p><p>To be sure, EA is making much more money these days from microtransactions and live-service elements than full-game sales. <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">For the past three months</a>, EA made $437 million form full-game sales and $1.458 billion from live service. For the full fiscal year, EA made $2 billion from full-game sales and $5.461 billion from live service.</p><p>Not everyone would agree that EA is getting the "quality-to-value" equation correct, though, as EA's games--and its sports titles in particular--are often criticized for their ubiquitous microtransactions. EA also just recently released the first paid season pass, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-introduces-a-paid-season-pass-and-some-fans-are-upset/1100-6531089/" data-ref-id="1100-6531089">people quickly voiced their concerns about it.</a></p><p>EA has a number of big games in development, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6.</a> With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 now delayed to 2026</a>, some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might release the game this fall</a>, but nothing is confirmed yet. The game will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">revealed properly at some point this summer</a>.</p>

Version 0.3.5 introduces a purchasable jukebox as well as the new storage unit property. If you're hyper efficient like me, making as many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/schedule-1-mixing-and-recipes-guide/1100-6530964/" data-ref-id="1100-6530964">Schedule 1 recipes</a> as quickly as possible, you'll have encountered a lack of storage multiple times in your playthrough. You can only squeeze a finite number of shelves into your normal property, after all.</p><p>The storage unit property will be located at the north end of the overpass next to the casino, and costs $5,000 to purchase from Ray's Realty. This makes it an easy get for anyone in the early few hours of the game, since it's one of the cheapest properties to own.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490721"></a><figcaption>Buy the Schedule 1 storage unit from Ray's Realty</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png"></figure><p>The storage unit, called Stash and Dash, allows for one worker and one loading bay, meaning you can have important ingredients or materials delivered to it. It's a limited space, but in the early game it's got plenty of room for several grow setups, and more shelves--perfect to stash all of your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-money-in-schedule-1-fastest-methods/1100-6531067/" data-ref-id="1100-6531067">Schedule 1 money</a> on, if you so desire.</p><p>Another addition is the jukebox, which you can buy for $1,500 from Bleuball's Boutique. Handily, this is right next to Ray's Realty, so you can buy both of the new features without the need for a trek across town. The jukebox adds the 19 tracks from the soundtrack, as well as eight brand-new tracks, all composed by Kaesul.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490722"></a><figcaption>The jukebox plays a total of 27 tracks by Kaesul</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>In addition, developer Tyler comments in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546734009405669632" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> that he's fixed some bugs around loading docks not showing at the barn or the docks warehouse, and a random $100 online balance appearing during a fresh save. Individual save files have been consolidated into larger save files to reduce the amount of time it takes to save, and to work better alongside Steam Cloud Sync.</p><p>The next steps for Schedule 1 include replacing employee beds with lockers to save space, adding filters to item slots so that you can decide which items belong in which slots, and the ability to transfer employees between properties--something we've been longing for since hiring our first botanist.</p>

			<p>There can be something strangely unsettling about stop-motion animation, particularly the old-school stuff made before the likes of Wallace &amp; Gromit gave the medium a softer edge. A few games over the years have tapped into that stop-motion aesthetic (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/harold-halibut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's Harold Halibut</a> being a good example) but the new handcrafted horror game The Midnight Walk really leans into the creepiness that sometimes accompanies the art form. The makers of The Midnight Walk, veterans of games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fe</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/lost-in-random/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost in Random</a>, went the extra mile, constructing actual physical models of all their characters and key props, which were then 3D scanned into the game to give everything that proper tactile look.</p>
<p>Is The Midnight Walk a carefully-constructed horror gem? Or will you want this stop-motion adventure to just... stop? Mosey onward for the answer…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Midnight Walk casts players as a mysterious figure simply known as The Burnt One (a pair of charred arms is all you’ll ever see of yourself) who befriends a cute/creepy living lantern named Potboy and a walking house named… Housy. Together you all set off on a journey along the titular Midnight Walk to reach the top of Moon Mountain, solving various problems and keeping one step ahead of a menagerie of horrors along the way.</p>
<p>Why exactly do you want to climb Moon Mountain? The Midnight Walk is a bit unclear about that and if you’re expecting a tightly-plotted narrative from the game, you’ll likely be disappointed. This game is mostly about vibes. That said, the game does take the FromSoftware approach of filling in various details about the world you're traversing via occasional bits of narration, audio logs, and so on. The game is split into chapters, with each location usually having some sort of dark or tragic backstory. The game manages to deliver a few surprisingly affecting moments while keeping cutscenes and dialogue to a minimum.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimately though, what really draws you into the world of The Midnight Walk is the game’s impressive presentation. The various beasties that Midnight Walk developer MoonHood have dreamed up hit that proper balance between charming and eerie, but perhaps the most striking thing about the game are its environments. Each chapter has its own theme of sorts, ranging from a monster-infested swamp, to a snow-blanketed haunted village, to a hand-crafted city overseen by a shambling giant, and some of the vistas within these areas are truly remarkable. The game's sumptuous visuals are elevated by excellent music that strays from the usual horror tropes, with some tracks having a classical or even jazzy feeling. This all works together to create a unique atmosphere and a persistent, but not overwhelming, sense of tension.</p>
<p>Playing on PS5, it was sometimes hard to fully assess how well the game was running, as herky-jerky animation is an intentional part of the game’s aesthetic. There were definitely occasions when the game’s framerate seemed to be chugging a bit though. That said, this isn’t exactly a fast-twitch action game so the performance stumbles weren’t a big issue.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, a game can’t get by on vibes and visuals alone, so how does The Midnight Walk actually play? The game gives you a fairly limited selection of abilities – you can command Potboy to interact with various things, which typically involves him lighting stuff on fire, and you can light things up yourself with matches that are strewn fairly liberally throughout levels. These matches can even be shot from a gun you’ll eventually acquire (it’s strictly used for solving puzzles – this game never becomes an FPS). Finally, you can also close your eyes, which may provide audio clues for solving some puzzles, open up paths marked by glowing eyeballs, and freeze or destroy some enemies marked by the same glowing eyes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Midnight Walk uses its limited mechanics in service of some fairly standard puzzles and stealth challenges. The game’s puzzles aren’t terribly complex, but provide just enough difficulty to keep your brain engaged. Stealth sections are also simple, but work well enough, at least early on. Towards the end of the game, things get a bit more complex, with players having to do things like lure enemies onto specific switches in order to progress. At times these challenges can feel a bit too fiddly for their own good.</p>
<p>The Midnight Walk is mostly very linear, although there are times where you have to backtrack a short distance or collect a series of MacGuffns within a somewhat more open area. There’s no map to guide you during these moments, with the game instead offering glowing trails that pop up and direct you where to go. This approach is functional, but you do feel like you’re being guided by the nose. Some sort of map or more elegant solution would have been welcome.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Really, The Midnight Walk feels the best when it’s at its least “game-y.” When you’re simply exploring and experiencing this haunting world. The stricter stealth sections, while generally okay, and sometimes even good, don’t stand out as unique in the same way the game’s world does. It should also be mentioned that The Midnight Walk can be played in VR, and I suspect it will work quite well as a VR experience (I only played the game the standard way on a TV). That said, I could also see some of the more fiddly moments I mentioned previously being a bit frustrating in VR.</p>

<p>The Midnight Walk isn’t necessarily cheap for an indie, coming in at $40, but it provides a decent workout with its story taking around 5 or 6 hours to complete. Meanwhile, alternate endings and a variety of collectibles may give you a reason to tackle the game again. I thought this walk felt substantial enough, but your mileage may vary.</p>

						<section>
				<p>The Midnight Walk is a real eye-catcher, offering one of the most distinctive and visually-arresting worlds yet seen in a horror game. As with most good walks, the experience is often best in its quieter moments, as the game’s puzzles and stealth sections range from good to sometimes merely adequate. That said, The Midnight Walk never strays too far off path and those in the mood for something spooky ought to enjoy the journey.</p>

			<p>While the wide adoption of the Nintendo Switch 2 system is the priority for Nintendo, the Japanese company may increase the system's price depending on the tariffs.</p>
<p>Following the latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">financial report</a> for the previous fiscal year, as reported by <a href="https://news-yahoo-co-jp.translate.goog/articles/156ec83309b814db7f93f8b0c00d1aeaae278ac0?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Yahoo Japan</a>, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa highlighted how the company's priority regarding the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 is to quickly make the system popular, and, as such, there will be an increase in advertising and promotion expenses for the company which contributes, alongside the system's low profit margins, to an estimated operating profit increase of only 13%. According to Furukawa-san, a profit increase will require an increase in software purchased per hardware unit, which may not be that difficult to achieve, considering the solid launch lineup.</p>
<p>If the company's plans for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch are clear, the future seems more uncertain, primarily due to the tariffs imposed by the United States, which have influenced the forecast for the fiscal year, based on the condition that they remain the same. Tariffs are considered a cost when determining the price of the system in any country or region, Furukawa-san said, and if the tariffs change significantly over the current assumptions, the system's price could be increased after evaluating various factors.</p>
<p>In previous console generations, consoles getting cheaper was a pretty safe assumption, but the current console generation has shown how times have profoundly changed. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Xbox Series X</a> now being more expensive than at launch in most of the world, it really wouldn't be surprising to see the Nintendo Switch 2 see a price increase after its launch window has passed, and Nintendo fulfilled its goal of making the system as popular as possible in that timeframe. If you're still on the fence regarding the new system, you can check out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on preview</a> to see what it has to offer, and if it could be a worthy investment when it launches on June 5th.</p>

In <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508">a new blog post</a>, Pocketpair explained that a patch in November removed certain gameplay features, and that an upcoming update will cull even more. “We have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of <em>Palworld</em>,” the studio says.</p><p>This started with a patch on November 30th, which most notably removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing a “Pal Sphere,” which is reminiscent of summoning pokémon with a Poké Ball.

Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa has said the company will consider raising the cost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> after the console launches, should tariffs change "significantly". 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors, Furukawa said that, for now, Nintendo wanted to focus on launching its new console and ensuring its success in the short-term. But beyond that, he continued, the picture was less certain.
</p>
<p>
"At this time, the top priority is to quickly popularise the Switch 2 hardware," Furukawa said, as reported by <a href="https://t.co/lF4AotymPf">Yahoo News</a> (translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1920449951370486181">Genki</a>).
</p>
<p>
"If the assumptions regarding tariffs change significantly, we would like to consider what price adjustments we should make and implement them after considering various factors," Furukawa continued.

<p>
Nintendo has attempted to mitigate the impact of US tariffs on the Switch 2's launch to date by raising the cost of additional accessories rather than the price of the console itself.
</p>
<p>
The company has also prioritised Switch 2 stock manufactured in Vietnam rather than China for shipments to the US, in order to take advantage of the better tariff rates (to date).
</p>
<p>
But the situation is still very much in flux, and US president Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs with most countries (including Vietnam) is currently set to run out in July. 
</p>
<p>
One report, by the Consumer Technology Association, has suggested that console prices could leap by 69.4 percent (thanks, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tariffs-could-increase-tech-prices-by-up-to-70-percent-and-reduce-gdp-by-usd69-billion-according-to-cta-report">Tom's Hardware</a>).
</p>
<p>
The past weeks have seen both Sony and Microsoft increase the price of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S respectively. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment</a>, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft, meanwhile, blamed "market conditions"</a> and rising development costs.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo revealed it expects Switch 2 will outsell its predecessor at launch</a>, with 15m sales during the current financial year. And with demand already exceeding sky-high expectations, it's easy to see why Nintendo might feel more able to increase Switch 2's price regardless.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-brings-new-regal-gear-next-week.1184214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's bringing lots of new gear for you to kit out your Helldiver with next week.</p>

<p>Following on from Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond" rel="nofollow">Borderline Justice</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a>, Masters of Ceremony launches on May 15th on both PC and PlayStation 5, and it brings "all-new elite weaponry, capes, and armors", in Arrowhead's words.</p>

<p>The first new weapon up for grabs as part of Masters of Ceremony is a rifle known as the R-2 Amendment, which packs not only a 20-round magazine but also a close-quarters bayonet to make fighting easier if you're overwhelmed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=MuBlt8gN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=BCxcr-ah 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>A new melee weapon, the CQC-2 Sabre, is also being added. It is, according to Arrowhead, "a sabre hailing from an elegant time", and as you'd probably expect, it's great for carving up enemies in close quarters, although it won't serve you quite so well at range.</p>

<p>Also on the weapon front, the Masters of Ceremony Warbond brings the new G-142 Pyrotech Grenade, an explosive that will "spin and shower the surrounding area in sparks before ceremoniously exploding in a ball of flames".</p>

<p>The final weapon being added as part of this Warbond is the CQC-1 One True Flag, a patriotic symbol that also "doubles as a spear to drive home the values of [Super Earth's] glorious sovereignty".</p>

<p>Of course, the Warbond also packs in new armor and a new cape to accessorize with, allowing you to deck out your Helldiver for maximum fear factor when you're storming the battlefield.</p>




<p>Although work continues apace on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking of new things.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yes-palworld-is-changing-mechanics-because-of-the-nintendo-lawsuit.1184211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has revealed that recent changes to the game's mechanics are, indeed, due to the ongoing Nintendo lawsuit, and that more changes are incoming in the next update.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Pocketpair says that just "as many have speculated", changes implemented in&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s 0.3.11 update, which was released in November, "were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation [from Nintendo]".</p>

<p>The changes in question revolve around&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s Pal-summoning mechanic, which used to be achieved through the use of a device known as the Pal Sphere, but is now instead done with a "static summon next to the player".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=5Osk9DDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=ilvNV2Zl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s mechanics are changing because of a lawsuit brought by Nintendo, and more changes are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Pocketpair acknowledges "frustration", both its own and that of its players, with regards to these changes. However, the studio says that not making the changes "would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience".</p>

<p>The studio goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming 0.5.5 update will bring "yet another compromise". Specifically, you'll no longer glide using Pals; instead, you'll need a glider item in your inventory, although Pals "will still provide passive buffs to gliding".</p>

<p>Just like the first change, Pocketpair says it knows this alteration will be "disappointing", but that "these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the lawsuit in question was brought against Pocketpair by Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">offending elements</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>appear to be specific gameplay mechanics that bear resemblance to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, including the aforementioned gliding and capture systems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=A4W4QDlR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=w7sxUEkP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is gunning for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, at least in a legal sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the ongoing lawsuit, development on&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>continues. The game recently received a major update allowing players to play with one another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">across different platforms</a>, and Pocketpair appears to be working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">cursed-looking dating sim spinoff</a> that may or may not be real.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens as a result of this ongoing Nintendo-Pocketpair legal battle, but I'd be very surprised to see&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>to continue without more major changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662857/alienware-aurora-16-16x-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-price-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Alienware is introducing a pair of new, more affordable gaming laptops: the Aurora 16 and 16X, starting at $1,149 and $1,949, respectively. Unlike the flagship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces">Area-51 laptops</a> announced back at CES, the Auroras are meant to be a little more versatile, portable, and comfortable for general laptop use. They replace the older Alienware M, X, and cheaper Dell G lines — which will be slowly phased out as part of Dell’s streamlining of its product lines. </p><p>Some configurations of the Aurora 16 and 16X are launching today in North America, with additional models arriving later.</p><p>The duo of indigo-colored 16-inch laptops are lighter, smaller, and cheaper than the 16- and 18-inch Area-51 models. They’re still pretty hefty at around 5.5 to 5.86 pounds, but much lighter compared to the 7.6 to 10 pounds of the Area-51. And the new models even have a stealth mode button that switches the RGB lighting to a simpler white light and tones down the fans. The Auroras get their name from one of Alienware’s desktop lines, but they’re meant to be taken places, as the 16 and 16X were designed to fit in a backpack thanks to a lack of thermal shelf (the big butt behind the hinge many gaming laptops have). Instead, the Auroras have a protruding bump beneath their chassis where their fans pull in air.</p><p>Spec-wise, both laptops have 16-inch displays, but the Aurora 16 has a 300-nit 120Hz 2560 x 1600 IPS panel, while the 16X has the same resolution but gets up to 500 nits and 240Hz refresh rate. The Auroras have two USB-A, two USB-C, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, a proprietary power plug, and Wi-Fi 7. Each has its ports on the left and rear, freeing up the right side for unhindered mouse movements while gaming. One of the USB-C ports on the 16X gets faster Thunderbolt 4 and DisplayPort 2.1 instead of just USB 3.2 Gen 2.</p><p>Both laptops can be outfitted with up to an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU, but for CPUs, the 16 gets Intel “Raptor Lake Refresh” chips — <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-core-200-non-ultra-cpus-may-be-rebranded-raptor-lake-alder-lake-chips-core-5-210h-spotted-with-slower-performance-than-the-core-i5-12450h">based on architecture from 2022</a> — while the 16X has the latest Intel “Arrow Lake” configurations up to the Core Ultra 9 275HX. While the Aurora 16 starts at a very low price that’s more akin to a MacBook Air, its starting config has a two-generations-old RTX 3050 GPU and just 8GB of RAM. That’s a pretty old GPU for a new laptop in mid-2025 and a shockingly low amount of RAM for any Windows notebook above $1,000, let alone a gaming laptop. Even Apple’s base models <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270669/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-16gb-ram-doubled-apple-intelligence-ai">now give you more</a>. The Aurora 16 can of course be purchased with more RAM than that, and the 16X starts with a more respectable 16GB and RTX 5060.</p><p>Dell-owned Alienware is angling these new models at gamers on a budget or those who can only justify one device for both play and work (or school). I just can’t help finding it funny that, between Alienware and its parent company Dell, it’s actually <em>Alienware</em> with the clearer and more pleasant-sounding naming scheme. Somehow, the try-hard gaming brand with an alien head logo understands that names are better than a mishmash of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement">Plus, Premium, Pro, and Max</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier today there was a mighty eruption of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach previews, featuring commentary on the new game's themes and social relevance from erstwhile <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> Solidifier and Kojima Productions boss Hideo Kojima. Themes and social relevance, eh! Kojima is one of the few bigwigs who will engage openly with such things, which is perhaps less praise of Kojima than a judgement upon the hesitant and anodyne way other blockbuster game creators discuss the impact of their work. </p>
<p>In this case, Kojima has talked at some length about how Death Stranding 2 builds on and, at times, resists the first game's theme of connection, based on his experiences of the Covid pandemic and his dislike of the "metaverse" - that ageing umbrella term for a newly monetisable "web 3.0" fauxtopia of networked technologies, ranging from VR to cryptocurrency, which many large video game publishers have sought to normalise in their hunger for profit growth.</p><!--more-->
<p>A quick and mildly spoilerific catcher-upper: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> <span tabindex="0">takes place in a North America near-obliterated by the opening of portals to the realm of the dead, which have trashed communications and rendered a lot of the countryside impassable. Among its plot elements is the construction of the Chiral Network, a spectral internet routed through a purgatorial dimension, the Beach, which is used to reunite a divided country</span>.</p>
<p>All of this was very much a political statement on Kojima's part. "We released Death Stranding before the COVID-19 pandemic," he recalled in a Q&amp;A at the latest Death Stranding 2 event, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-he-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-hes-not-going-to-make-it/">as reported by VGC</a>. "The world was heading towards isolation and division, such as the UK leaving the EU. So I was saying, 'Let's connect. We're headed for disaster if we don't connect.' That was the theme, story, and gameplay for Death Stranding.</p>
<p>"After the release, just three months later, we entered the pandemic, and I was really surprised," Kojima went on. "It looked like Death Stranding, in a way. In the real world - the 21st century - we have something similar to the Chiral Network, which is the Internet. This was a little different compared to the 19th century, such as the Spanish Flu or the like. We survived the pandemic because of the Internet and people were connected online."</p>
<p>Now that the pandemic is "over" - that's to say, now that the continuing circulation of Covid has become <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/covid-19-in-2025-a-constant-threat-but-a-manageable-one/">"manageable"</a>, and the <a href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/respiratory-viruses/covid-19">weekly death tolls</a> no longer make headlines - Kojima is revisiting the idea of the Chiral Network and portraying it more negatively. This stems, apparently, from his own experiences as a studio manager trying to persuade remote workers to return to the office. </p>
<p>"What happened was, there are now people in our studio who work from home, and I still don't know their faces," he continued. "Even music concerts were cancelled, and it all became online streaming. I understand this was unavoidable at the time of the pandemic. The same thing applies to schools; instead of getting to play with your friends or learning from teachers, you just look at a screen online which isn't any different from watching YouTube videos."</p>
<p>In a leap of association that deserves more interrogation, Kojima also linked the normalisation of remote working and socialising during the pandemic to the much shat-upon metaverse concept - which, I would argue, has many origin points besides the pandemic.</p>
<p>"Everything was leaning into the metaverse," he said. "When you turned on the TV, everyone was talking about how it was the age of the metaverse now and there was no need to interact with people. I felt that we were going down a terrible path. Communication between human beings is not meant to be this way.  You meet people by chance or see sights you didn't expect to see. With the way we were headed, you would lose all of that."</p>
<p>All these concerns led to Kojima rewriting the concept of Death Stranding 2 to fit his experiences of the pandemic. "It's the strangest thing," he said. "After I created a game with the theme of 'let's connect instead of division and isolation,' we had the pandemic, and I began to think, 'Maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much'," he said. There are specific characters and events in Death Stranding 2 that express these feelings, though Kojima naturally didn't give anything away during the event.</p>
<p>According to VGC, Kojima's sense that humanity now has too much of the wrong kind of connectivity has also shaped his approach to press events. It was "the reason he had insisted on hosting media from around the world, in-person, at his Tokyo studio last month", rather than putting together an online preview event, as is now routine.</p>
<p>"You came all the way here and played for four days," Kojima said. "This may typically be done online nowadays. But this game is about connection. You will know when you play further into Death Stranding 2; I think you will start to feel it after a while.</p>
<p>"That is why we invited you to physically come during your busy schedules, and people from all over the world have gathered here, and I'm sure you all met with many people and had many conversations. You saw the view from Tokyo Station, or you may have walked into a random restaurant - these things are the human experience. These coincidences and unintentional happenings connect seamlessly, but that doesn't happen with the metaverse."</p>
<p>As often with Kojima, there is a blend of insight and crushing naivete or obliviousness to all this, with the usual caveats about possible misunderstandings due to linguistic and cultural disconnects. I greatly enjoy Kojima's willingness to disagree with the direction of his past projects, and even offer a playable rebuttal: it's a healthy change from the "more/better" rhetoric you generally get from triple-A sequel-makers. I share his distaste for the metaverse, whatever that currently means, and sure, I like to meet my own colleagues in the flesh, now and then. </p>
<p>That said, a lot of this reads like yet another manager throwing a tantrum about his employees and associates exerting some agency with regard to their own health and social requirements. It echoes active efforts to put an end to remote-working elsewhere: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activisions-ending-of-hybrid-working-for-qa-staff-leaves-our-most-vulnerable-employees-behind-says-union">Activision, for example, recently ended hybrid working for QA staff</a>, in what union workers branded a prelude to "soft layoffs". Rockstar are reported to have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">required GTA 6 developers to return to the office</a> in the name of "quality and polish". All of which serves company management far more than it does the workers, especially those who have disabilities and other life factors that make working from home preferable, even in the <em>absence</em> of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Personally, I remote-work partly because it's more convenient, but mostly because I have clinically vulnerable relatives and Covid is, in fact, still happening. I do attend press events in person (I still <a href="https://defector.com/why-i-keep-masking">mask up</a>), but I'd rather do the bulk of them online. I would probably have said no to this particular press trip, if I'd learned in advance that it was designed to illustrate the sublime importance of returning to the office.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see how Death Stranding 2 explores the fallout from the pandemic. As a canary in culture's coal mine, Kojima's work can be slapdash and cheesy but it is always worth wallowing around in, yanking up all the threads. Still, the language here doesn’t inspire much hope of a complex portrayal. That line about "the human experience" turns my craw inasmuch as, like most appeals to "the human", it doesn’t acknowledge that different human beings have different contexts, different needs and different degrees of autonomy and privilege.</p>
<p>It's strange, because there's quite a pronounced labour politics element to the first Death Stranding. Your character, Sam Porter, is an overtaxed delivery guy with bosses who sometimes muscle into his "private" quarters as holograms, even chasing him into the shower. I'd be interested to see the purposeful oppressiveness of those interactions extended into a critique of demands for a return to in-person working "after" Covid. Anyway, Death Stranding 2 is out for PS5 on 26th June, with a PC launch to follow - last we heard, it was slated for 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Did you watch the new GTA 6 trailer and think, ‘Wow, the bubbles inside that bottle of beer look really, <em>really</em> good?’ You’re not alone. Hundreds of millions of viewers have now watched the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer and marveled at the technical brilliance on display. And knowing that the trailer footage was all <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-some-said-gta-6-trailer-2-looked-too-good-to-have-been-captured-on-a-base-ps5-rockstar-confirms-it-really-was-and-theres-even-gameplay-in-there">captured on PS5</a> is just mind-blowing. But are we being set up to be fooled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN spoke to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a>’s Alexander Battaglia to help break down what we saw and understand whether there are any takeaways we can glean from the newest GTA 6 trailer and how it might translate into actual gameplay experience on console. And it turns out, we can.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The trailer is running at 30 fps and is completely made up of — presumably — real-time cutscenes and not gameplay — hence the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen,” Battaglia says. “I imagine the game’s primary target for such cutscenes is 30 fps, and it’s likely the same for gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">30 fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X is nothing new. Games often come with either a fidelity mode, which prioritizes up to 4K resolution at 30 fps, or a performance mode, which targets 60 fps at lower resolution. But with the launch of the PS5 Pro, Sony has made efforts to bridge the two modes, and it’s something Battaglia says we’ll likely see pushed closer to the game’s release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Given the image quality in the trailer, which may well be a use of FSR1 (AMD’s AI performance enhancing tool and the basis of PS5 Pro’s PSSR) from a low internal resolution, PS5 Pro could enhance image quality through the use of PSSR making a less aliased, more detailed image with less blur.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally speaking, I tend to always opt for performance mode over fidelity mode, but one of the key selling points for PS5 Pro is that you don’t have to make that choice, you can have both. So while Digital Foundry thinks PS5 Pro can improve image quality, the big question is: Will GTA 6 run at 60 fps on console?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry tech breakdown</u></a> posted on YouTube, the panel seems to agree that GTA 6 will not be able to hit 60 fps on console. “As soon as you have RTGI [Ray Traced Global Illumination], a massive open world, those things tend not to run well at 60 fps… I think everything points to this being a 30 fps game, maybe with a 40 fps mode on some [consoles].”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The trailer uses ray tracing extensively, which could be further enhanced on PS5 Pro</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of the matter is ray tracing, which Digital Foundry says seems integral to GTA 6, not just from a tech perspective but an artistic one. “You can’t get rid of RTGI. It’s inherent to the way the game works. And they’re throughout the trailer, so they obviously made them a part of the gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leonida, Rockstar’s version of the Sunshine State, is full of light. Whether it’s from the sun itself beaming on bright beaches and suntanned bodies, or the neon lights illuminating Vice City’s nightlife, ray tracing feels core to GTA 6’s art direction, and also why it likely won’t run higher than 30 fps. It could also be where PS5 Pro players find the most joy over their PS5 and Xbox Series X counterparts: “The trailer uses ray tracing extensively, which could be further enhanced on PS5 Pro,” Battaglia says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the ray tracing improvements on PS5 Pro are speculative, you only have to compare the new GTA 6 trailer with the first one to see that Rockstar is hammering the importance of RTGI to the look of GTA 6. “Real-time ray-traced transparency reflections are much more obvious in this trailer, so glass on beer bottles, cars’ windscreens, building windows, and more look particularly good.” The bubbly beer that hundreds of millions of GTA fans are obsessing over is why GTA 6 might not run at 60 fps, but also why GTA 6 might look even better on PS5 Pro. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While 30 fps seems to be the default across consoles, PS5 Pro’s better ray tracing capabilities mean this key GTA 6 feature should get a better showcase on Sony’s more powerful console. To date, the improvements PS5 Pro offers over the base console varies wildly from one game to the next, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxzpAluabec" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows currently the best showcase</u></a> for what the console can do. But I’m hoping Rockstar and GTA 6 take it a step further and make the difference even more noticeable.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the opposite end of the powerhouse scale is the Xbox Series S, which is currently the weakest console that can play GTA 6 (there’s no word yet on whether Rockstar will bring GTA 6 to Switch 2). Digital Foundry says that to get GTA 6 on the Series S, Rockstar may need to sacrifice ray tracing completely to run the game at 30 fps, with sub-1080p resolution. But the Series S still has the same ballpark CPU power and storage as Series X, so it’s not impossible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still a whole year until GTA 6 hits shelves (sadly), and with only two trailers released so far, there are still a lot of unknown variables. But even the changes from the first GTA 6 trailer to the newest one reveals loads of interesting technical details, from a constant 30 fps captured on PS5 to the improved ray tracing. And with history telling us that Rockstar typically only releases 30 fps GTA games, all signs are pointing to the same for GTA 6 – although if the trailers are anything to go by, the series has never looked better. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

You might not know him by name, but Hachiya is known for his ambitious products, like a flying machine inspired by the works of Miyazaki and his own take on a real version of the hoverboard from the movie Back to the Future.</p><p>Hachiya created the <a href="https://www.petworks.co.jp/user_contents/hachiya/works/OpenSky_Q&amp;A.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"OpenSky" project</a> that led to the creation of a motor glider based on the <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/M%C3%B6we" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mowe plane </a>from the Miyazaki anime <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>. Hachiya succeeded in creating a glider version of the aircraft and a jet-powered version. Take a look at the plane for yourself in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-OPa7cTrg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hN-OPa7cTrg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Before building his Miyazaki-inspired plane, Hachiya made <a href="https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/exhibitions/2006/opensky-2-0-hachiya-kazuhiko/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wearable devices that would allow the wearers to see through each other's eyes</a>.

In addition to being a director at PetWorks, Hachiya is currently a professor of fine arts at Tokyo University of the Arts and the Director of the Art Media Center at Tokyo University of the Arts.</p><p>Hachiya is also known for developing the email app <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/19970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PostPet</a>. This software attempts to make corporate emailing more fun by having a little creature--a dancing pink bear named Momo is one of them--who lives in your computer personally deliver emails.</p><p><span>Nintendo will vote on whether or not to confirm Hachiya's appointment to the board during the company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 27, 2025.</span></p><p>This will happen not long after Nintendo releases the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on June 5.

Expedition 33 has a robust system for buildcrafting, and one of them turns the character Maelle into a weapon of mass destruction. It's primarily an endgame build that revolves around the Stendhal skill, and when done correctly, it's capable of eliminating enemies in a single blow.</p><p>In an update on its <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920387317002293303" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media channels</a>, Sandfall says that Stendhal was "underwhelming for most of development" and that it was boosted before Expedition 33 was released. "We still want you to be able to break the game--and you absolutely still can--but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy," Sandfall wrote.</p>

<p>The patch to adjust Stendhal's damage output will roll out to Steam first on May 9 before it lands on other platforms, and Sandfall added that it'll still be capable of one-shotting enemies, but it'll be "more in line" with other strategies and builds.</p><p>This build does require quite a bit of work up front before you can use it, as you'll need to acquire a specific weapon and several passive Pictos skills to maximize the damage output. It's not uncommon to smash through enemies who have health bars in the range of 50 million, and several players have managed to optimize the build to deal <em>billions</em> in damage.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/">Even with the surprise launch of Oblivion Remastered</a> just days before it was scheduled to arrive, Expedition 33 continues to be one of the big hits of 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-numbers-keep-climbing-as-more-players-jump-into-the-rpg/1100-6531328/">The game has sold over 2 million copies</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it was also a day-one launch through Game Pass. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-reaches-another-impressive-achievement/1100-6531372/">The soundtrack is also performing exceptionally</a> well, as it reached No. 1 on Billboard's Classical Album charts, and it has been streamed over 18 million times since it went live.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-2k-mafia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that the whole Mafia franchise is coming to GeForce NOW. This includes the classic titles, the remakes and remasters, and even the upcoming Mafia: The Old Country game, which will be available on the cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at launch on August 8</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of GeForce NOW games added this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Survival Machine (New release on Steam, May 7)</em></li>
<li><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Spirit of the North 2 (New release on Steam, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II (Classic) (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia III: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Towerborne (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On this GeForce NOW list, our David Carcasole has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> Revenge of the Savage Planet, which he found funny, beautiful, and yet tedious:</p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down.</em></p>
<p><em>But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s most powerful abilities is about to get nerfed, so if you want to keep doing absolutely outrageous damage numbers with Maelle, you've got one more day to get your fill.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920387317002293303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, developer Sandfall Interactive says that Maelle's ability Stendhal has "ended up overshadowing most other options" in the fencer's arsenal. The studio says the ability was "underwhelming for most of development", which resulted in a "big damage boost" that the developer says "overdid it".</p>

<p>Sandfall says that it "hadn't planned to make any balance changes" this early into&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s release, but that Stendhal's overpowered nature "clearly stood out", making things "a bit too easy" for those using Maelle in combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=IUpEg18O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=vFjl_iwl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maelle's most powerful ability is getting nerfed in&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite Stendhal's nerf, Sandfall says it still very much wants you to "be able to break the game", and that you "absolutely still can".</p>

<p>Stendhal will remain a "strong single-hit skill with great synergy potential", but it'll be "more in line with everything else" rather than standing out as Maelle's best option in every combat situation.</p>

<p>Changes to the ability will come as part of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s first round of hotfixes, which will arrive on Steam tomorrow, with other platforms to follow soon after. There likely won't be any other changes on the same level as those being made to Stendhal.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you haven't yet unlocked the Stendhal ability for Maelle, it becomes available automatically at the beginning of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s third act. I shan't say any more for fear of spoilers.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is a turn-based RPG heavily inspired by classic JRPG franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive, the game takes place in the Belle Epoque-inspired land of Lumiere, which is subject to the whims of the Paintress, a monstrous figure who paints a descending number each year, causing everyone of that age or above to die.</p>

<p>It's proven a popular game among fans; sales of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">reached two million</a> within less than two weeks of the game's launch, despite the fact it's also available on Game Pass.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/clair-obscur--expedition-33/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can play it as part of a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate subscription as well.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> releases next week, and with it the realisation that Doom Guy has come a long way since the murder of his <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Daisy">beloved rabbit Daisy</a> at the hands of hell. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pigface">Pigface</a> is naturally a genre descendant of Doom, I cannot say for certain if the evil rabbit that commands you to go do sledgehammer murder in its <a href="https://titolovesyou.itch.io/pigface-combat-demo">Itch.io combat demo</a> is a descendant of Daisy. Either way, it's an ominous critter. "You know what you did to deserve this," says the rabbit. A free sledgehammer? Thanks rabbit! I knew I was good this week.</p>

<p>Ah, so you've actually got a bomb collar around your neck. I knew not to trust a creature who'd so willingly part with quality tools. You're immediately thrown into ramshackle kill gauntlets, first with the hammer, then with guns. You gobble down morphine syringes to heal. Everyone you fight wears a mask and no shirt, lured here by the promise of a fat payday if they can kill you. Guns feel tight and good to use, but the act of actually shooting people feels oddly guilty.</p>
<p>These sort of snuffy, Manhunt vibes can go either way, but Pigface embracing the bleak cruelty of its premise works, I think, in service of a hopeless, grimy atmosphere. It's been a while since a game made me feel genuinely nauseous, but art that hits you right in the stomach is effective art all the same. It reminds me, if anything, of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a> that's decided to wallow in the lethal nastiness of game guns instead of deconstructing them. There's a little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> in there too.</p>
<p>The combat demo has been floating around for a bit now, but the game recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3341650/view/496068513597753194">received full funding</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/white-knuckle">White Knuckle</a> publisher DreadXP, and is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3341650/PIGFACE/">coming to Steam</a> at some unspecified point in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
