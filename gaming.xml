<p>Still coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><em>Are</em>Fans are still speculating as to what exactly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/danganronpa-2x2">Danganronpa 2x2</a> is — part a remaster and rerelease of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_2_goodbye_despair_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa 2</a>, part a brand new scenario, the game is largely shrouded in mystery. But while we wait for more info (and a firmer 2026 release date), Spike Chunsoft has opened up pre-orders for the physical release of the game.</p>
<p>On both Switch 1 and Switch 2, Danganronpa 2x2 will be getting a standard physical release — stocked at various retailers for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> — which appears to include the game fully on the card for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Plus. there's a special collector's edition, appropriately-named the 'Psycho Tropical Vacation Package'. This will set you back <strong>$139.99 USD</strong> and includes a RSVLTS reversible Psycho Tropical hat, a Kidrobot 3" figure of bother tropical Monokuma and Monomi, an OST which includes remixes of the best tracks from the original game, and a clamshell-style outer box to display your collection in.</p>
<p>In addition, if you pre-order directly from <a href="https://store.spike-chunsoft.com/">Spike Chunsoft</a>'s Shopify page, you'll get a 4" Monokuma Flight Tag.</p>
<figure data-uuid="aee2552de968a"><a title="Danganronpa 2x2 Psycho Tropical Vacation Package" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aee2552de968a/danganronpa-2x2-psycho-tropical-vacation-package.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spike Chunsoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Canadian store <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/products/danganronpa-2x2-standard-edition-nintendo-switrch-pre-order?bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP</a> has also opened up pre-orders for the game for <strong>$84.99 CAD</strong> (or <strong>$194.99 CAD</strong> for the special edition). European European orders will be handled by Reef Entertainment.</p>
<p>We haven't seen much of Danganronpa 2x2 since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">its reveal at the September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, though it was shown off at the Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Fes: Ultimate Appreciation Festival back in November.</p>
<p>The "all new storyline" being added to this rerelease is reportedly meant to be as long as the base game, which means double the content. And probably double the shenanigans. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_v3_killing_harmony_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa V3</a>, anything is possible...</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Binding Of Isaac Dev’s New Game Takes 500 Hours To Complete And Will Take Players ‘Months or Years’ To Find All Of Its Secrets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-completionist-secrets-hours-binding-isaac-roguelike-2000667343</link>
            <guid>1431577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Tuesday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the tactical RPG-slash-life-sim roguelite about breeding and battling cats, created by developers behind </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Closure</span></i><span>, launched and almost immediately shot to the top of Steam’s charts. </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>seems like it’s shaping up to be the next big hit for roguelite sickos, in no small part thanks to how absolutely massive its scope is.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/edmund_mcmillen_here_mewgenics_is_steam_deck/"><span>an AMA on the Steam Deck subreddit</span></a><span> over the weekend, developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel teamed up to answer fans’ questions about the game, and they revealed that it’s a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>larger than anyone previously expected. In one response, McMillen referred to the game as “one of the largest tactical RPGs of all time.” In another, he revealed that “it will take an average player about 200+ hours to ‘beat the game’ and 500+ hours to 100% :)” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/its-going-to-take-you-over-500-hours-to-100-percent-complete-mewgenics-according-to-creator-edmund-mcmillen/"><span>PC Gamer</span></a></em><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Judging by the game’s 281 Steam achievements and the fact that it has 1,000 unique abilities to unlock, that estimate doesn’t sound like much of a stretch. And it seems like </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ most dedicated players might end up pouring quite a few extra hours into hunting for secrets. According to Glaiel, “there’s a lot of little things that I think people will be discovering for months or years. But we will reserve the true ARG level stuff for DLC.” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-dlc-secret-unlock-arg-binding-of-issac/"><span>Polygon</span></a></em><span>).</span></p> <p><span>While the base game’s absurd length should tide players over for a long time, McMillen also said the team is planning on beginning work on the game’s DLC in the next few months, with a planned release around a year later. McMillen also hinted that a Switch 2 port might be on its way. The game is currently only available on PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>From delayed development to the top of the charts</h2> <p><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>was announced all the way back in 2012, but the project entered a long period of development hell (and was even cancelled at one point). Despite the game’s wildly tumultuous development cycle, it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><span>apparently pretty good</span></a><span>. It’s currently the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">highest-rated game</a> on Metacritic for the year so far. If <em>Binding of Isaac</em>‘s trajectory <a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-designers-new-game-is-both-uncomfortab-1728533526">is any indication</a>, this is only the start of a long and wild post-launch life for <em>Mewgenics</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I haven’t had a chance to pick up the game yet, but I’ve been having a blast watching players share their freakish findings online all day. Even McMillen couldn’t resist sharing some of his own discoveries in the AMA—he wrote: “my nephew Eli had one where he could punch one of his other cats in the face and it would send out 1000 sparkles to totally destroy all enemies instantly…the game is so insane man, you don’t even know.”</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mixtape-preview-its-all-about-the-music-in-the-idyllic-90s</link>
            <guid>1431571</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that mixtapes (or Spotify playlists now) were an important part of those crucial, formative teenage years. I'm also sure that I'm definitely not alone in the shared experience of putting together the perfect playlist to share with my friends or a significant other. Simply put, those playlists tell a story. And while the ones from my teenage years may seem like nothing more than whatever cool metalcore bands I was into and in at the time, te memories created from those long lost CD-Rs and iTunes playlists still stick with me years later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The importance of music during that formative but extremely awkward time is how we expressed ourselves and built an identity. The subgenres and scenes were as important to me as anything during those teenage years playing in garage bands, getting sunburned at the Warped Tour, and sifting through thousands of MP3s on my beat-up laptop in order to build that week's lineup of songs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In video game form, Mixtape does – at least so far – an excellent job at invoking the feeling of needing that perfect soundtrack for day-to-day life. From the start of the demo, I was skating in a picturesque northwestern town during golden hour while listening to Devo’s “That’s Good”. The vibe check was passed immediately when the protagonist, Stacey, breaks the fourth wall and explains the importance of good headphones and a good playlist. Mixtape’s presentation is a hybrid of a traditional point-and-click adventure similar to Life is Strange, mixed with abrupt but natural fourth-wall breaks for exposition and what the characters are feeling in that moment. While this isn't a new thing, very few games have managed to pull it off like Mixtape does, and it has yet to overstay its welcome. </p><p>Mixtape seems best described as a blend of a video game and a stylish TV show.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the few chapters I've played, Mixtape seems best described as a blend of a video game and a stylish TV show. The camera work and intentionally low frame rate animation on the characters lend a charm to it, and the dialogue, while a bit campy, never took me out of the moment. Stacey, Slater, and Cassandra are very much your typical teenage archetypes in the best way possible. While they weren't annoying or overbearing like some rebellious teen-fronted games tend to be, the trio are definitely written in an unrealistic way that works perfectly for the story Mixtape is trying to tell. It's obvious that these three are meant to be stereotypical in a way that evokes a feeling of nostalgia from the player. There were a few moments where I found myself saying “been there before,” and for a story that's clearly trying to invoke a specific feeling of anemoia (nostalgia for a time that never existed) with the player, it nails that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's talk about Mixtape’s namesake. The music here, while not necessarily anything that would have landed on one of the thousands of CD-Rs I made as a teen, is outstanding. In the little bit of the campaign I played, the needle drops included a mix of songs ranging from Devo to Silverchair, which show the potential diversity of Mixtape's final soundtrack, and I'm glad the developers at Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur  didn't go with your run of the mill “safe” selection of hits from the ‘90s. It's obvious that the team is digging deep with the music selection in order to not only tell its story about music snobs hoping to craft the perfect mixtape in order to get a job as a music supervisor, but also tell the story about the final day of three teens' high school years. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, vibes and music aren't everything when it comes to video games, and the gameplay is where Mixtape started to feel a little flat. While there were a few moments in the demo that required a bit more interactivity than finding something highlighted on screen, such as escaping from the police in a shopping cart, throwing toilet paper at Stacey’s principals house, and positioning Stacey and Slater into various poses in a photo booth, the select chapters I played felt like they were missing the welcome bit of interactivity that other point-and-click adventures offer. While the best moments had a decent amount of gameplay, a few chapters felt like I was watching a (very polished) interactive show rather than playing a video game. That being said, Mixtape's gameplay isn't necessarily the selling point here, because every time I found myself thinking about it, something cool would happen on screen, the needle would drop, and I would be pulled right back into Stacey Rockford's story. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mixtape - February 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing 30 minutes of Mixtape, I can clearly see the direction Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur is looking to take with this ‘90s-set teenage adventure. The visuals are striking, its sense of nostalgia and warmth are unlike anything I've seen recently, and the needle drops definitely made me want to play more than what the demo allowed me. Is it going to be everyone's favorite thing? Probably not, but that's the fun of making the perfect mixtape, isn't it? </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mixtape-preview-its-all-about-the-music-in-the-idyllic-90s]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1431565</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We'll have an old fashioned wedding.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Stardew Valley are eager to get married... again. To whom? They don't know. But they're hoping their bride/groom will be a couple of individuals in particular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand why, take a look back at our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valleys-17-update-will-add-2-new-marriage-candidates">own interview with ConcernedApe</a>, where he exclusively revealed to us that the next update, 1.7, would include two new marriageable characters. He wouldn't say who they were, and we don't even know if these will be brand new characters or existing characters that suddenly become available. While ConcernedApe will let us know later this month on the game's 10th anniversary, that hasn't stopped people from wildly speculating who it'll be, and there are a few theories reigning supreme right now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Logically, we can put together that we will likely get both a man and a woman, as all the other candidates have opposite-gender pairings for events like the Flower Dance. To find out who the most popular people in the game for romance were, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qv52zk/a_form_to_see_which_unmarriageable_npc_people/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user JeffTheKillerFa put together a poll</a> for fans to see who came out on top. They've since posted the results, showing Sandy coming out waaay ahead of the other single women (Marnie was in second place), and the Wizard winning the vote for single men.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But interestingly, fans have latched onto another possibility that we could see in 1.7: breaking up an existing couple. The poll also asked fans who of the currently married individuals in the valley they wanted to steal. Robin was the clear winner, with players clearly not losing any sleep over breaking her up with Demetrius. That's even something <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qvlwl7/concernedape_talking_about_wanting_to_make_robin/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConcernedApe has discussed as a possibility before</a>! But Caroline (currently married to general store owner Pierre) was also a favorite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a bit of a gag, the poll also included a section for "non-giftable" characters, or individuals who you can't currently form even a friendship with due to a lack of ability to give gifts and limited dialogue options. Marlon of the Adventurer's Guild was a pretty obvious winner here, followed by Gunther from the museum. And in a final poll, it seems like people don't necessarily want to marry the Dwarf, but like Krobus, they wish she would move in as a roommate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These poll results do seem to line up roughly with comments posted all over the community since our interview about who people want to see. However, there's one character that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qxi6ei/my_number_one_pick_for_a_marriage_candidate/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got some attention on socials</a> who wasn't in the poll at all:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/hat-mouse-1770744501998.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qxi6ei/my_number_one_pick_for_a_marriage_candidate/">https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qxi6ei/my_number_one_pick_for_a_marriage_candidate/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the Hat Mouse! I too would love to marry the Hat Mouse! We could run a little hat store together! Of course that's realistic!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it's possible we're going to get two brand new characters in the valley, and all of this speculation will have been just silly wishcasting. But until ConcernedApe says otherwise, I will be eagerly awaiting the addition of my preferred combo of Hat Mouse and the Wizard, the most obviously romantic individuals in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

    <p>“Your life is going to be horrible, so that’s free money as far as I’m concerned,” streamer Northernlion said before setting a short position on a small alien baby made of molten igneous rock. He was playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642000/Space_Warlord_Baby_Trading_Simulator/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</u></em></a>, an absurdist stock market simulator that lets you speculate wildly on the lives of alien babies. Short, brutal and laugh out loud funny, it is a game that is only marginally more evil than the financial markets that rule our lives.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3meacbkreps2u" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicndkjei5x4d6qyacndmxrdfzhjnq47xmzgygutatsuzlkmrtymq4">— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3meacbkreps2u?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-02-07T01:45:21.507Z</a></blockquote></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> starts on a positive note: in the year 3478, devices called FutureSee terminals have given the intergalactic masses limited insight into the long term consequences of the future of companies, conflicts and star systems. This was a massive boon for civilizations everywhere, as technology improved and most wars were now avoidable. But it also devastated all speculative financial markets, as now nothing could be speculated on. With no other options, the financial industry turned to the only speculative asset it had left: the lives of individual babies, which were too volatile and immediate for the terminals to see. That’s right, it’s time to get out there and speculate on the lives of babies.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCiL6h8x7qM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator -  STEAM LAUNCH TRAILER"></iframe></figure><p>The latest game from publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/"><u>Strange Scaffold</u></a>, <em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> feels retro in a thoroughly specific way.

Tonally and aesthetically it feels indebted to games like <em>Dinopark Tycoon</em>, <em>Afterlife</em> (a<a href="https://aftermath.site/27-years-later-lucasarts-afterlife-is-brilliant-brutal-and-few-know-how-to-beat-it/"><u> game I was obsessed with</u></a>) and the masterpiece that is <em>Star Control 2</em>. It is absurd on its face, totally unsubtle with what it’s saying, and none the worse for it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>"Likely event: MELTED DOWN FOR BEING TOO OLD" Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like <em>Drug Wars</em> before it and the stock market generally, the goal is to buy low and sell high. You follow the lives of individual babies on a market-style ticker, buying stock in their lives at their worst and selling at their best. The baby’s overall health is indicated by a beating heart on the right side of the screen. The goal is to optimize your profit and make more than you started with plus the cost of the entry fee. The stock ticker will flash various events in the baby’s life from “covered in gleple poop” to “learned what reading is” (their value goes down after this event).&nbsp;</p><p>On top of simply buying stock, you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)?ref=aftermath.site"><u>short</u></a> a baby if you are confident their life will get measurably worse in the near future. However, this can backfire tremendously and potentially bankrupt you should you be wrong and they get a promotion or find love. If a baby dies in the span of the short, the short is voided. And though you can choose one of four potential babies every day, side bets can be placed on each of them for potential events, life span and overall value.</p><figure><figcaption><span>"BURNED IN JAIL CELL." Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>The campaign features nine distinct characters and scenarios representing different traders. The plot of each character adds a significant mechanical tweak to each trading period, with four distinct outcomes to each scenario: failure, bronze, silver or gold. For example, trader Holmit Miskie is a disgraced junior financial planner at Holmit &amp; Spawns whose elderly clientele wishes to get in on the new baby trade, a market his bosses are not confident in and thus are setting him up for failure. He is a sad sack who looks like the alien equivalent of Jack Lemmon in <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, and mechanically he is not allowed to take side bets. Nuria Voll is a retail trader who puts their rent and everything they have to get into the lucrative baby trading market. Mechanically, she is scammed every day by the lease on her “HiValue Guaranteed trade license” and enters the market just as the entire thing goes to shit in what’s known as “The Great Flip.” Mechanically, the market gets twice as expensive and half as profitable halfway through her run. Rep. Hoddle is a legislator who regulates the market, and thus is not allowed to interact with it, save through an intermediary named Willy “No Hands” Shig. Mechanically, this legal loophole of an unscrupulous proxy adds a significant delay to every purchase and sale, making it harder to trade on volatility.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Wenbill is one of the most vile creatures in all of video games. Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to this, there are seven different planets you can trade on, each of which have wildly different market tendencies for the babies on them. For example, Google Gibby is a “war world,” where half of the planet is permanently in conflict to benefit the arms industry. This constant state of war means that baby investments tend to trend steady upwards before the baby’s life turns reliably horrible, often for war-based reasons. Cantor Vantis, meanwhile, is a tropical reality tv show planet where galactic children are sent to compete on the show “Get Big or Die Trying,” and which can lead to sudden fortunes before sudden, comically </p><figure><figcaption><span>"Legally, not a dog." Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Real Housewives</em>-themed deaths. Though the potential for wealth is high, you could lose everything if they die in a celebrity mishap while you’re holding the bag.</p><p>Assisting in your buying and selling are advisors, who can lend insight into the lives of each baby for a fee with varying degrees of accuracy. Details range from the average price of the baby, the value of the baby at age 30, the floor price of the baby, random events in the baby’s life, the longest duration of its positive upswing, and so on. Advisors are key to making money. For example, if you know the average price of a baby is about $3,000, and the baby has been trading below that for several decades, you know that it will have to swing upward above $3,000 for a specific period of time for the overall amount to average out. Occasionally, the knowledge of the advisors will sometimes intersect with the side bets, allowing you to make smarter calls on which baby will pay out aside from the general odds given by the bookies.</p><figure><figcaption><span>What if ancient Greece was also Disney Land.</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> is exhilarating, absurd and compelling in the same ruinous way that day trading or speculative investment is. Like <a href="https://aftermath.site/qup-esports-universal-paperclips/"><em><u>Q-UP</u></em></a>, it is a game that takes the mechanical form of the thing it is lampooning, successfully having its cake and eating it too. It is the ideal game for someone like Northernlion to stream, and him screaming like a r/WallStreetBets guy is an incredible bit of comedy. It is not a game that overstays its welcome, and it leaves you wanting more to play (an endless mode would be nice, but maybe that defeats the purpose).&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qn7c7fg31xw?start=127&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="I'm actually a mod on r/WallStreetDads (Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator)"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>He really does sell it well.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> is also a game that could not be more germane to the moment. The last six years have been maddening if you believe in anything resembling financial regulation. Gambling is functionally legal from your phone in most of the country, the market has never been less rational, insider trading is happening nakedly on a historic scale and the entire economy is held together by bubble gum, petty scams and investments that mathematically could never pay out. Every day you wake up, and every day you think “this will be the day that the bottom falls out,” and that sensation of freefalling you felt in 2008, if you were old enough to remember it, forms like a lead ball in your stomach.</p><p>This is not to say that there was some golden era in which the markets were ever ethical–the average 401k or pension quietly finances pure evil–but there was a degree of plausible deniability diffused in the market. Private equity, crypto, and the AI bubble have made those realities increasingly harder to ignore, and now everything is gambling to some degree. And now prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket let you bet on the outcomes of everything <a href="https://www.404media.co/unauthorized-edit-to-ukraines-frontline-maps-point-to-polymarkets-war-betting/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including war</u></a> with little to no oversight. There’s literally a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzXFURkcCt4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>grotesque Kalshi ad</u></a> with roughly the premise as this game made with enthusiastic generative AI slop aliens and zero self awareness. Given how supremely warped the world we live in is, how much worse is it, really, to short a baby?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced a new board game set in the world of Exandria. The new board game, <em>A Familiar Find</em>, is all about the loyal animal companions going on an adventure on behalf of their summoner.</p><h2>Critical Role's <em>A Familiar Find</em> Board Game Announcement</h2><p>According to an official <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/afamiliarfind/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on Darrington Press' website, A Familiar Find is a fast-paced strategic card game. In the game, players take on the roles of magical familiars charged with an important task by their arcane master.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>That task is to find rare magical ingredients across the land of Exandria. To that end, you will explore ever-shifting magical locations, seek and collect magical components, and try to stay one step ahead of rivals attempting to sabotage you. Those rivals will set traps, call your bluff, and attempt to ruin any strategies you implement. Thankfully, you can utilize your own wits and magical spells to vex them as well.</p><p><em>A Familiar Find</em> is designed for up to four players. Each copy of the game contains a rulebook, over 84 Arcane Cards, 13 Location Cards which contain various game-changing effects, and ten playable familiars complete with their own unique character boards. The first player to either collect a full set of ingredients or three Astral Essence cards is declared the winner.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-campaign-4-episode-1-review-fascinating-narrative-frame-glorious" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a> fans may recognize a few of the playable options. They include Trinket, the armored bear from Campaign 1 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>, the Wildfire Spirit Monkey, Mister, and the reanimated rat Pate de Rolo are from Campaign 3.</p><p>Curiously, <em>A Familiar Find</em> doesn't feature any companions from Campaign 2. Sprinkle the Crimson Weasel and Nugget The Blink Dog, two of Jester's pets from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-mighty-nein-season-1-review-but-theres-only-eight-episodes-of-you" rel="nofollow">The Mighty Nein</a>, aren't mentioned.

It's another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> dev vlog, this time one with a big focus on multiplayer. This ability to play with, heaven forbid, other people is one that developer Unknown Worlds very much understands is not for everyone, given the first game's big focus on isolation and ruffing it yourself. So, this vlog is all about explaining why you don't need to worry if you like to go solo. And also to show off a dive elevator.
</p>
<p>
In the video, lead engineer Jon Bjarnason noted how the very first internal demos the studio held only a few weeks after development were multiplayer, and that "every single feature that we made since then has been multiplayer capable." But, as design lead Anthony Gallegos explained, "The important distinction there is that any part of the game isn't going to require cooperative play. If I want to come along and bring a friend, they can totally participate with me in every moment along the way. We never wanted to encroach on someone's game that just is like, 'I want to play solo.'"

<p>
Essentially, co-op is entirely optional through every aspect of the game, it's just that every aspect of the game also has co-op in mind. This stretches right through to things like animations too, as now other people can see your whole human body, so limbs and the like need to work properly, something that Brandt Beach, who I'm making sure to mention by name because it's funny his name is Beach and he's working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, says is more work, but worthwhile.
</p><p>
There's also that snazzy new dive elevator, which is as literal as it sounds, a fancy doohicky you hold onto to help you dive down deep into the depths. "The Dive Elevator just adds a lot to co-op in general," lead gameplay engineer Adrian Lopez-Mobilia explains. "I realized that it would be really cool to be able to both go with friends on it, but also to be able to attach stuff to it. So, as we started developing the prototype we realised that that would make it even more meaningful. Be able to load it up and then shoot it down to the depths and then come back with all the stuff you collected down there."
</p>
<p>
It also sounds like they're trying to make playing with your friends as easy as possible, as you'll have the option to invite folks to play either through your platform of choice's friends list, or through an in-game one for cross-play functionality. A big emphasis was placed on being able to play the game anywhere too, as a whole team is apparently devoted just to optimising the game for handheld devices like the Steam Deck apparently.
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that Subnautica 2 is also a slightly contentious game at the moment, given that the ex-leads of the game are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">suing publisher Krafton</a> after being ousted from the company, ultimately leading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">Unknown Worlds themselves to sue these former execs in kind</a>. A tad messy! So throw an appropriate amount of caution to the wind here.

              <p><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs are assessing the damage from an ongoing duplication glitch before they decide how to respond. <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-of-besiege-beaten-with-a-single-perfect-machine-1688320789">Ten years later</a>, <em>Besieged</em> still has new content coming. And <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> isn’t skimping on its fighting game roster at launch. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>Bryan Dechart, the actor who played Connor in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, might be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samitron.bsky.social/post/3mehke7eta22r">teasing fans with the threat</a> of a sequel. Quantic Dream has announced a live-service MOBA called <i>Spellcasters Chronicles </i>and a <em>Star Wars</em> game called <em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>, but it’s now been almost eight years since it last shipped something. Maybe in the <em>Detroit</em> sequel the humans will try to become AI instead of the other way around. Or maybe Dechart is just trying to get <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/2020873211286528029">more subscribers on Twitch</a>.</p>   <h2>A duplication glitch taking over <em>Arc Raiders</em> gets an emergency fix</h2> <p>Embark Studios has been playing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r0x0i7/just_a_heads_up_before_you_check_the_patch_notes/">whack-a-mole with this exploit</a> for a couple of weeks now and it’s taking its toll. Players can essentially duplicate any item in the game that their character can hold, leading to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qq36np/12m_loot_in_one_raid_killed_a_guy_with_this_loot/">inventory screens</a> that all look hacked. Today’s big &nbsp;1.15.0 patch didn’t include anything addressing the issue, but Embark ended up rushing out a hotfix just hours later.</p>

 <p>“We have just pushed a hotfix to resolve the current duplication issue. We are still actively monitoring the situation to ensure we’ve covered all cases – should you encounter other duplication issues, please raise them to us in the bug report channel,” the development team wrote on Discord. “We are still investigating the full impact of the issue, and will be taking action based on the severity of the different cases as we complete our investigation.”</p> <h2>A group of <em>Valheim</em> devs have a demo for their next game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMxYZAlpPU"><em>Begraved</em> is a medieval PVE looter</a> from some of the developers who made the hit Viking survival crafting sim. Think a co-op dungeon crawler with extraction shooter elements. It now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113160/Begraved/">a free demo</a> for players to try on Steam ahead of its upcoming Early Access launch.</p>

 <h2>Hit medieval destruction sim <em>Besiege</em> goes to space</h2>  <p>The unusual physics sandbox arrived a decade ago, only hit 1.0 on Steam five years ago, and is still heading to new frontiers.<em> Besiege: The Broken Beyond</em> will hit Steam sometime around mid-2026 and add a new campaign, environment, mechanics, and blocks.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> will feature 20 comic book characters at launch</h2> <p>That number <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-tokon-steams-page-has-been-updated-revealing-roster-size-20-characters-at-launch-single-player-mode-64-player-lobbies-psn-acc-required.1430548/">leaked on Steam</a> ahead of this week’s PlayStation Showcase. <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384">Arc System Works’ riff on the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> formula</a> has already confirmed eight of its roster members, including Captain America, Doom, and Iron Man. It’s very light on <em>X-Men</em> characters at the moment so maybe the upcoming State of Play will reveal Magneto and others are joining the fray.</p> <h2><em>Until Dawn</em> studio Supermassive reveals a new release date for its next game</h2> <p>Upcoming horror release <em>Directive 8020</em> was supposed to be out last year but ended up getting a long delay. It’s now resurfaced with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61OMILUgVyo">a new trailer</a> and a May 12 launch date. Hopefully it marks a turnaround from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/18/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-interactive-has-reportedly-laid-off-45-people">the very rough last few years</a> the studio’s been through.</p>

 <h2>A <em>Marathon</em> hands-on leak out of China sounds very positive</h2> <p>Bungie’s extraction shooter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r0wp7k/marathon_handson_event_in_china_impressions_leaked/">reportedly had a recent test event there</a> that went very well. General impressions summarized in a <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JCcPzYEov/">video posted on Bilibili</a> suggest a lot more depth and tension than the original alpha test in early 2025 conveyed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Get ready to take over the career of the “Best in the World” CM Punk in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported several weeks ago that CM Punk, the WWE 2K26 cover star, was planned to be the focal point of this year’s WWE 2K Showcase. Now, 2K has confirmed the news and is giving fans a deep dive into what to expect this year and the different paths to unlock all Showcase content.</p>







<h2 id="h-get-punked-in-wwe-2k26-showcase">Get Punked in WWE 2K26 Showcase</h2>



<p>WWE 2K not only released a written <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> on the forthcoming mode, but also a new trailer narrated by the current WWE World Heavyweight Champion, who breaks down how players can relive his history in some matches and rewrite it in others.</p>



<p>The mode, taking a page from last year’s Showcase, kicks off with a match from this year’s WrestleMania, putting players in the middle of the action between Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, and CM Punk. Other historical bouts include John Cena, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, The Undertaker, Brock Lesnar, and more. Check out the full list of historical matches below:</p>



<ul>
<li>CM Punk vs. JBL, SummerSlam 2008</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio, Armageddon 2008</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Randy Orton, WrestleMania 27</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Undertaker, WrestleMania 29</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. John Cena, RAW Feb. 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. The Rock, Elimination Chamber 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs Brock Lesnar, SummerSlam 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre, Bad Blood 2024</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Seth Freakin’ Rollins, RAW Jan. 2025</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Seth Freakin’ Rollins vs. Roman Reigns, WrestleMania 41</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also three announced “Fantasy Warfare” scenarios. One match sees CM Punk take on Steve Austin. Another sees CM Punk facing off against Eddie Guerrero. The last sees CM Punk teaming up with his wife, AJ Lee, to do battle with The Miz and Maryse. These all take place in a fantasy arena called the “CM Punkvillion.”</p>



<p>Lastly, there are the what-if scenarios. These include matches that ask questions such as “What if CM Punk never left WWE in 2014?” and “What if certain rivalries went differently?”</p>

<h2>Players Can Choose to Run the Gauntlet Instead</h2>



<p>For anyone who wants to unlock all the content associated with WWE 2K26’s Showcase mode, players can simply run the Gauntlet instead. In this mode, you can choose either CM Punk or AJ Lee and try to beat 20 consecutive opponents. In any case, there is a wealth of content to be unlocked.</p>



<p>Speaking of unlockables, this year’s game introduces a new Ringside Pass system. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">this link.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/pax-autocratica-early-access-release-date-has-been-pushed-back-again/</link>
            <guid>1431484</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer Multiverse has announced that it is delaying Pax Autocratica’s early access release date again. It was originally scheduled for February 2nd, then moved to March 4th. Now, the release date has been set for May 7th, meaning an additional two month delay. The reason is that from further internal testing, the studio has decided it needs more time before the colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid is ready.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Autocratica - Official Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9bREKlyMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the developer Multiverse highlighted three particular areas for improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Early Experience &amp; Onboarding – Final adjustments to how new citizens are introduced to core systems, improving early-game flow, clarity, and pacing based on player feedback.</em></li>
<li><em>Core Systems Polish &amp; Balance – Light tuning across progression, base building, and management systems to incorporate requested quality-of-life improvements and ensure a smoother, more consistent experience.</em></li>
<li><em>Performance &amp; Stability – Ongoing optimization and bug fixing to address reported performance issues, edge cases, and crashes before Early Access authorization.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>

<p>On <strong>17th February 2026</strong>, owners of the Nintendo Switch versions of both games will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Editions for free. And if you have the newer console, why wouldn't you? The price for the Switch 2 Edition straight-up hasn't been announced.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, you'll be able to play both games and 1440p and 60fps docked, while handheld is bumped to 1080p and 60fps. You all want to see some terrifying sea creatures in crisp, shiny visuals in the dark now, don't you? *shudders*</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ptsgqh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Controls have also been "optimized" for Switch 2, so perhaps there's some Mouse Mode integration there?</p>
<p>Both Subnautica games arrived on Switch 1 back in May 2021 and we enjoyed both of them a lot — though the first game <em>just</em> edges out Below Zero for us. If you've never played them before, then make sure you have a read of our reviews, <em>and</em> check out the rundown from the games' eShop page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining the award-winning game Subnautica with its sequel Subnautica Below Zero, this Nintendo Switch™ exclusive allows players to fully immerse themselves in the full mystery surrounding the water world of planet 4546B.</p>
<p>Craft equipment, pilot submarines and out-smart wildlife to explore lush coral reefs, volcanoes, cave systems, and more - all while trying to survive in both hostile water zones and frozen terrain.</p>
<p>Features:<br>
- Survival Is Key: Gather valuable materials, craft tools, manage your hunger and thirst, all while evading the dangerous wildlife that sees you as its next meal<br>
- Crash Landing on Planet 4546B: Beneath the serene waves of this aquatic planet are clues around its complicated history and how it warps the lives for all those that crash land there<br>
- Exploration: Delve into unique aquatic and terrain biomes that will unlock not only materials, but the answers that you seek<br>
- Build Your Habitat: Crafting and building the comforts of home here. These bases will be integral for your survival from not only the wildlife, but also the harsh environment around you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sequel, <strong>Subnautica 2</strong>, is due to come to Early Access 2026, but Switch 2 isn't one of the slated platforms for it.</p>
<p>Plus, the sequel's publisher Krafton (who acquired the dev in 2022) and Unknown Worlds are embroiled in a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">rather messy lawsuit</a>. Krafton has also attracted additional negative attention after it announced it was working on becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">an "AI first" company</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>

			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>According to two separate and trustworthy sources, <strong>Microsoft</strong> is reportedly considering the merging of the <strong>Xbox Game Pass Premium</strong> console subscription tier with <strong>PC Game Pass</strong>. The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> that the plans are far from finalized, but that's what Microsoft is thinking right now, and Windows Central has subsequently <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-plans-to-expand-xbox-game-pass-and-merge-pc-game-pass-with-another-tier-more-third-party-service-bundles-may-be-on-the-way-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed up the reporting</a> with its own sources.</p>



<p>Here's a breakdown of the respective feature sets as they are currently available to users:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Feature</th><th data-align="left">PC Game Pass</th><th data-align="left">Xbox Game Pass Premium</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Price</strong></td><td data-align="left">$11.99/month</td><td data-align="left">$14.99/month</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Platforms</strong></td><td data-align="left">PC only</td><td data-align="left">Console, PC, Cloud</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>First-Party Day-One Access</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No (added within 1 year)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>EA Play Included</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Cloud Gaming</strong></td><td data-align="left">No</td><td data-align="left">Yes (unlimited)​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></td><td data-align="left">N/A (PC only)</td><td data-align="left">Yes (on console)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Game Library Size</strong></td><td data-align="left">Full PC catalog</td><td data-align="left">~200 games</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Merging Xbox Game Pass Premium with PC Game Pass likely means the new tier would include <strong>cloud gaming, EA Play, and first-party day-one access</strong>, arguably the three primary features of Game Pass. Of course, <strong>it's most likely going to cost slightly more</strong> if this plan goes through. It's hard to take a guess, but perhaps somewhere around $17-18.</p>



<p>At that point, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <strong>could really need more bundled third-party services to boost its value</strong>. Indeed, that's the other half of Warren's rumor, though he does not share any specifics on which ones. <strong>Ubisoft+ Classics</strong> and <strong>Fortnite Crew</strong> are already included <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since October's big restructuring</a>, so it would have to be something else. Do you reckon Microsoft should go forward with this merger plan, or would you rather things stay as they are? Let us know in the comments below.</p>



<p>In related Xbox news, it seems like the next-generation console <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2027</a></strong>, but Microsoft hasn't fully committed to that yet. Most sources agree <strong>it's going to be a console/PC hybrid</strong> that runs PC apps and will even have different SKUs from other OEMs like ASUS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Norwegian Olympic athlete Sturla Holm Lægreid wasn’t celebrating when he won a bronze medal at the ongoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-thing-about-the-winter-olympics-are-the-drone-cameras-2000666958">2026 Winter Olympics in Italy</a>. Instead, he broke down on live TV and confessed to cheating on his girlfriend three months before.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nrk.no/ol/sturla-holm-laegreid-innrommer-utroskap-pa-direkten_-_-mitt-livs-storste-tabbe-1.17763479">On February 10, as first reported by </a><em><a href="https://www.nrk.no/ol/sturla-holm-laegreid-innrommer-utroskap-pa-direkten_-_-mitt-livs-storste-tabbe-1.17763479">Norwegian Broadcasting Company (NRK)</a>,</em> shortly after <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/norway-and-france-top-podium-mens-biathlon-20km-individual">Sturla won a bronze medal in the men’s 20km biathlon,</a> he was interviewed about his accomplishment. And it was during this interview that Lægreid pivoted to confessing to recently cheating on his girlfriend, losing her, and being miserable.</p>

 <p>“There is someone I wanted to share this with who might not be watching today,” said Sturla in a post-event interview. “Six months ago, I met the love of my life, the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago, I made the biggest mistake of my life and was unfaithful.” He said he’d admitted a week ago to cheating and added, “This has been the worst week of my life.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="no" dir="ltr">Så ikke helt denne komme. Tidenes mest absurde medaljeintervju. 🫣 <a href="https://t.co/fFwJ1B0vCO">pic.twitter.com/fFwJ1B0vCO</a></p> <p>— Daniel Vassbund (@Smoothedan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Smoothedan/status/2021231796759748765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span dir="auto">“I want to be a good role model, but I just have to admit when I make mistakes. </span><span dir="auto">It hurts to admit when you do something you can’t stand for and hurt someone you love so much. But that’s life now.”</span></p>

 <p>So why did Sturla admit to cheating on his girlfriend at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/winter-olympics-injecting-penis-acid-skiing-real-men-ski-jumping-cheating-2000666137">Winter Olympics</a> right after winning a medal? Well, in a follow-up inteview with <em>NRK</em>, the skiier explained it was his attempt at possibly getting her back.</p> <p>“I have nothing to lose. I had a chance at true love, and I screwed up so badly. It’s not necessarily forgivable. But if this gives me a tiny chance to tell her how much I love her, I’d rather commit social suicide on live TV just to get that little chance,” said Strula.</p>

 <p>When the reporter pointed out that he just aired their private situation publicly to the world, he seemed to realize this was probably not the best choice, replying: “Maybe I messed up my chance now to get her back.”</p>

<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-launches-with-new-map">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Launches With New Map</h2>



<p>Two maps will launch next season. The first of which is called “Contaminated.” <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA previously stated</a> that the map size falls between Eastwood and Mirak Valley and is comparable to classic Battlefield maps such as St. Quentin Scar from Battlefield 1 or Arras from Battlefield 5. The map is also supposedly designed to specifically address time-to-action concerns.</p>



<p>In the same blog post, EA tells fans that Golmud Railway, a popular map from Battlefield 4, is being rebuilt for modern Battlefield and will be available in a future season.</p>







<h2>Battlefield 6 Has Been a Financial Success</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of 2025. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-ea-sales/">EA’s NET bookings increased</a> 38% year over year, driven by the success of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Despite this strong start, player numbers have declined due to a lack of post-launch content. Perhaps the launch of season 2 can turn that around.</p>

More like space the final funtier am I right (cue canned laughter that goes on a touch too long)? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a>, the physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building game</a> about building all manner of medieval machinery to destroy your enemy, has taken you to all kinds of lands and with its 2024 expansion, The Splintered Sea, a few oceans too. But with its newly revealed follow-up expansion, there's nowhere to go but up (because it's set in space, hence my absolutely hilarious opening line).
</p>
<p>
This next expansion, only sort of shown off in a brief teaser trailer, is called "The Broken Beyond," and sees you doing your usual thing of putting some wood and metal together until you've got something that could wipe out an army, but against aliens this time. "Put your engineering talents to the test as you master space flight, navigating gravitational fields, avoiding asteroids and other challenges using a suite of exciting new blocks," the expansion's Steam page description explains.

There's a new campaign to play through where you'll head to different planets, build some spacecrafts, and presumably make a space catapult. You'll also find new space themed blocks, a new sandbox to play around with, and suitably, some new physics mechanics. Details are slim aside from that, but I'm quite tickled by the commitment to sticking with that medieval aesthetic even in the far corners of the galaxy. It's certainly not a vibe for those who are particular about anachronisms, but to them I say find a different hobby.
</p><p>
The expansion doesn't have a release date as of yet, though its trailer says it should be coming in Q2 this year, so you don't have all that long to wait ultimately. And if you like, you can add it to your infinitely growing Steam wishlist right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639470/Besiege_The_Broken_Beyond/">here</a>.

So if you have a subscription and still haven’t gotten around to Insomniac’s latest open-world superhero romp, it sounds like you’ll be able to play it soon for free.</span></p> <p><span>Though Sony hasn’t announced it yet, </span><i><span>Dealabs</span></i><span> says that </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Neva </span></i><span>will be part of February’s PlayStation Plus offerings. </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>is obviously the headliner, and it’s also coming to the service at a pretty opportune time, as the next game in Insomniac’s Marvel universe is imminent. </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer-ps5-release-date-bloody-2000628275"><span>is coming to PS5</span></a><span> later this year and while it won’t star Peter Parker and Miles Morales, it will take place in the same shared universe, so there will likely be a nod or two to the Spider-Men’s stories.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>launched on PS5 in 2023, then came to PC </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-pc-steam-psn-login-nycc-2024-ps5-1851676683"><span>a little under two years later</span></a><span>. The sequel stars both Peter and Miles as playable characters, and sets up a potential third game that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-spider-man-yuri-lowenthal-ice-alex-pretti-2000663563"><span>actor Yuri Lowenthal</span></a> <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive"><span>confirmed is in the works</span></a><span>. The first two games, </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</span></i><span>, are both part of the PlayStation Plus catalog if you have an Extra or Premium membership, so the whole series will be available to you if you’re a subscriber.</span></p> <p><span>We’ll probably get official confirmation from Sony this week, especially with the State of Play presentation </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-sony-marvel-wolverine-release-date-2000666866"><span>scheduled for Thursday</span></a><span>. I can already see them showing off new footage of </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>, giving that game a release date, and being like, “Hey, you can play all of Insomniac’s other Marvel games now on PlayStation Plus.” Brand synergy, ya know?</span></p>

<p>Well, that didn't take too long! After launching on the Switch eShop back in December, Dotemu and Tribute Games have today updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> to ver. 1.0.5, bundling in a fresh batch of hero colour palettes to boot.</p>
<p>The 'Cosmic Collabs' update includes a new wardrobe option for 12 of the 15-hero roster, each inspired by a different Marvel game. Spider-Man and Venom each get a crossover fit from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Black Panther and Rocket Racoon take theirs from <strong>Marvel Snap</strong> art, She-Hulk and Wolverine's new looks come from <strong>Marvel Strike Force</strong>, Captain America and Nova take inspiration from <strong>Marvel Future Fight</strong>, Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill's palettes are all about <strong>Marvel Contest of Champions</strong>, and even <strong>Marvel Puzzle Quest</strong> gets a nod in Storm and Iron Man's fresh threads.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. The update also includes its fair share of bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and new features, so you can be sure things are running smoother than ever before as you put these new palettes to the test.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753970?emclan=103582791475080003&amp;emgid=519737782627731794">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion Ver. 1.0.5 (10th Feb 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Epic MARVEL Games Collaborations!</strong></h3>
<p>We’re bringing in tributes to our favourite MARVEL Games experiences, including palettes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Rivals</strong></em> - Spider-Man and Venom</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Snap</strong></em> - Black Panther and Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Strike Force</strong></em> - She-Hulk and Wolverine</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Future Fight</strong></em> - Captain America and Nova</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Contest of Champions</strong></em> - Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Puzzle Quest</strong></em> - Storm and Iron Man</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>New Features!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hero Lab Upgrades</strong> - with new palette previews to help you get a great view of new cosmetic options, and a new Team Level indicator.</li>
<li><strong>Tweaked Arcade Modifiers</strong> - swinging into danger with modifications. The Double HP modifier is now an HP Multiplier - where enemy HP can now be multiplied by 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 times their standard amount!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay Improvements!</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve made a number of visual changes based on your feedback, designed to make it easier for you to keep up with the on-screen action, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroes will now be highlighted when HP is low</li>
<li>The Focus bar has been split to make it easier to read</li>
<li>Special Damage number visuals have been changed to red - making them easier to identify</li>
<li>The Heteropteron Level Larva Bug has been tweaked to make the enemy stand out. In addition, we’ve added flashes on the Larva during throw animations and introduced colour cycling effects on the attack!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also taken some time to go back for further balancing on boss fights, tweaking these to provide a little more fair play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hela</strong> - Increasing cooldowns for both Grudge and Hellblades attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Venom</strong> - Reducing block and parry actions and removing combo parry, increasing reaction cooldown, lowering damage on the Bite attack and removing some post-Grudge attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Phyla-Vell</strong> - Reducing block actions and lowering chance of using Cosmic Attack. We’ve also added cooldown on some attacks, increased the cooldown on cosmic Fury and lengthened the initial block action to prevent instant parry.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bug Fixes!</strong></h3>
<p>As well as all this, we’re squashing some bugs of our own!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a blocker caused by using Cosmic Ghost Rider’s special attack just before triggering a boss cutscene</li>
