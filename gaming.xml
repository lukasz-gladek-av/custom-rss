<p>Respawn didn't provide a specific reason as to why updates would be discontinued on Switch - although we can guess that it's something to do with the hardware given support continues on Switch 2 - but did say the discontinuation was part of the studio's goal to "continue to evolve Apex Legends' content and technical foundation" and "deliver a high quality experience".</p><p>"All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts," the team explained. "Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026. Please note that in some regions, local laws require you to use digital currency within 180 days of purchase.</p> <div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deadlock-valve-moba-hero-shooter-cast-characters-update-is-it-good-2000664616</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A thriving fan art community is always a sign of an entrenched playerbase. </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>, Valve’s secretive MOBA hero shooter, is currently teeming with creations all over social media that span the big three categories: horny, cute, and funny. In a way, these are perfect descriptors for the overall vibe of the latest six heroes to join the roster, which, alongside a plethora of additions and visual tweaks introduced in last week’s big update, have led to a newfound momentum worth paying attention to.</span></p> <p><span>The game’s lineup includes the sword-wielding demon Apollo, the unicorn-horned performer Celeste, arms expert priest Venator, a sleepy small creature named Rem, werewolf bounty hunter Silver, and </span><i><span>Wednesday</span></i><span>-coded necromancer Graves. Each hero brings a distinct presence to the roster, which is now made up of 38 misfits. Valve, however, didn’t add all six of them at once—rather, they’ve let the community vote on who they want to unlock first, with two heroes being released per week starting on January 26.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664618">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>People have indeed been showing up, making all sorts of fan art </span><a href="https://x.com/GrimboGrim/status/2015347283672641853"><span>championing</span></a><span> their </span><a href="https://x.com/spiritedby_moon/status/2015127369133285628"><span>faves</span></a><span> and asking others to vote for them, with votes being awarded by winning and taking part in matches. In-game, you can place sprays of propaganda posters displaying your candidate of choice, and some folks have seemingly spent a </span><a href="https://x.com/kelskiYT/status/2016286525299032410"><span>considerable amount of time</span></a><span> doing so. Considering that the MOBA continues to be available solely via invites from Steam friends and its </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/"><span>store page</span></a><span> is deliberately non-descriptive, the communal enthusiasm makes for a commendable contrast.</span></p> <p><span>So what’s </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> all about? Structurally and spiritually, it’s a MOBA. Matches can easily go to hell if your team is uncoordinated. Purchasing the right items based on your character’s strengths and weaknesses to put together a good build is a fundamental part of the experience. How well you farm resources (souls in </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>) in order to unlock and upgrade your hero’s abilities can easily turn the tide. You know, the usual.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yet the DNA shared with hero shooters is tangible. It’s present in how you control characters and how you face the action on the map. While everyone has different acrobatics to offer, they’re all intersected by the same mechanics, which are quite distinctive in the genre. You can dodge to the sides and in mid-air, wallrun, slide on the ground, mantle over ledges, and double jump. The maps themselves are designed with these maneuvers in mind: the latest update introduced vents and crawlspaces, adding yet another mobility layer. From their conception, however, maps encourage exploration, with plenty of alleyways to snake through and vertical architecture that’s ripe for the occasional rooftop fight. Speaking of which, melee attacks are quite important during combat, and you can even parry (and be parried).</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664619"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664619">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Jumping into a regular match can be disorienting to say the least, especially without prior knowledge of what to expect from characters or an idea of which items to get. Last week’s update, however, smartly added a new mode called Street Brawl, which is similar to ARAM in </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span>. In essence, it bitesizes the average 30-minute match by automatically pitting two 4v4 teams against each other on a single line, rather than the usual 6v6 across three lines, making it so that smackdowns are immediate, more intimate affairs.</span></p> <p><span>There’s also no farming or shopping involved in Street Brawl. Everyone starts each of the best-of-five rounds with equal resources, so you can access your four abilities from the jump and upgrade them often, and you’re offered three random item sets to pick from before plunging into the fray. In essence, Street Brawl lives up to its name by inviting you to focus on the fight. But there’s enough strategy involved to make it a great introduction to the overall game, as you get acclimated to heroes and maps without having to commit to longer matches where the stakes are higher, and everyone is, well, more stressed.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> draws influences from many sources, and it’s far from the first MOBA to experiment with more agile third-person experiences (see </span><i><span>Smite</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Paragon</span></i><span>, for example). At the same time, </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> oozes style in a way few other online games have accomplished, with fantasy, occult, and steampunk elements coexisting in harmony in its noir depiction of New York. There are dashes of </span><i><span>Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Hellboy</span></i><span> combined with the grit of a dive bar restroom in Bushwick, Brooklyn.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000664648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664648">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The simple act of countering the often gray and dull aesthetic of some MOBA and hero shooters—a trap that even Valve itself almost fell into with </span><a href="https://deadlock.wiki/Neon_Prime"><i><span>Neon Prime</span></i></a><span>, an early development of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> with a sci-fi aesthetic we’ve seen ad infinitum—is already a distinctive quality. Yet the aesthetic would simply be a charming backdrop if it weren’t for the strong cast of characters breathing life into the world.</span></p> <p><span>Take the freshly unlocked heroes as an example, which won the majority vote for this past week. Graves is a student necromancer who uses the dismembered hand of her mentor as a primary weapon, can summon flying skulls, and also create a gravestone that spawns ghouls over time. Rem, on the other hand, is a little sleepy guy who tosses his pillow at a distance, commands a group of (even smaller) minions that can collect loot and provide support to allies, and also puts foes in an area to sleep with his ultimate ability.</span></p>

 <p><span>Characters are, in essence, the single element that fosters longevity in MOBAs, offering fresh air to already established rosters. But aside from purely mechanical incentives, if they don’t look cool, what’s the point? It’s been apparent for some time that Valve is putting a great deal of attention into the design of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>’s characters, but this latest batch of heroes, alongside one last year that included a punk goat and not one but two vampires, are helping to solidify the art style, and in turn, the identity of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> altogether.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000664649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664649">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are quite a few distinctive gameplay elements and visual features that set </span><i><span>Deadlock </span></i><span>apart, from the ziplines hovering over each of the lanes on a map that are used for traversal to the way chat text is displayed as dialogue bubbles under each character portrait. Yet it’s the hero roster I keep coming back for. Valve is clearly aware of the attention on them, as it continues to add </span><a href="https://x.com/deadlock/status/2017004723241415086"><span>dialogue interactions</span></a><span> between characters (et tu, </span><i><span>Left 4 Dead</span></i><span>?) as well as smaller, nonetheless significant details like different portraits when a hero is on a killing spree or in a critical state.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s still early to say if </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> will become the next big thing. According to </span><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/"><span>SteamDB</span></a><span>, its all-time peak was 171,490 concurrent players, which happened shortly after the alpha launch in August 2024. According to Steam’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed"><span>official charts</span></a><span> as of the early hours of Friday, it has reached a 100,000 concurrent player peak, which hasn’t happened in a minute. While the numbers are obviously dwarfed by its older MOBA sibling, it’s not small either, especially since it remains an invite-only affair.</span></p> <p><span>Metrics aside, and regardless of whether the current momentum can last after the remaining four heroes are unlocked, I’m finding joy in this rare phase of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>. There isn’t a store, microtransactions, or a battle pass being shoved in my face. Ranked matches and rank distribution are absent, too, so that competitive edge is yet to influence how players engage with the game. And yes, the game is indeed still a work in progress, reflected in tech issues that pop up at random. At the heart of it all, though, the additions of the latest update seem to have finally brought the core experience to realization, while cementing the world and ambiance that engulfs it more firmly. What Valve decides to do next is a mystery. For now, I’m content with continuing to get to know its band of misfits, one brawl at a time.</span></p>

		<p>Respawn has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> will end support for the original Nintendo Switch with Season 29, meaning that the game will no longer be playable on that platform when Season 30 debuts on 4th August 2026.</p>
<p>While Apex Legends is leaving the older hybrid handheld behind, the game has had a native port for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> since last August, and cross-progression via an EA account means that player progress, purchases and unlocks can be carried over. Even so, the ability to buy in-game currency on Switch is being removed.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/10/apex-legends-switch-worth-playing-resolution-frame-rate-crossplay-graphics/">Apex Legends dropped onto Nintendo Switch in 2021</a>, and was another example of getting something that shouldn’t really run to work on the mobile chipset inside. It was a necessarily compromised experience in terms of resolution (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/09/apex-legends-nintendo-switch-resolution-and-frame-rate-when-is-it-out/">topping out at 720p docked and 576p handheld</a>) and frame rate (only shooting for 30fps). With the native Switch 2 version, all of that is dramatically improved to run at 60 fps and with 1080p docked and 1008p handheld.</p>
<p>Here’s the statement from social media:</p>
<p>Hey legends, we want to share an important update about Apex Legends on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Season 29 will be the final update for Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch. Future seasons of Apex Legends will continue to be available on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Starting August 4, 2026 (Season 30), Apex Legends will no longer be playable on the Nintendo Switch system.</li>
<li>Until August 4, 2026, players can continue to jump into the action, earn rewards, and enjoy matches per usual.</li>
<li>Beginning August 4, 2026, in-game premium currency will no longer be available for purchase on Nintendo Switch, though any existing balances can still be used before August 4, 2026. Players can use any existing balances from Nintendo Switch on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
<li>All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts. Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026. Please note that in some regions, local laws require you to use digital currency within 180 days of purchase.</li>
<li>All the above only applies to Nintendo Switch and not Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apex Legends will continue to be available on all other supported platforms. As we continue to evolve Apex Legend’s content and technical foundation, our goal is to deliver a high quality experience. Thanks to Nintendo’s investment in the Nintendo Switch 2, the platform offers a great handheld experience for Apex Legends.</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to the Nintendo community that has been with us on this journey since Day 1, and we hope to see you on the Dropship on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

While the 40+ level matchmaking option, Solo vs. Squads, was positioned by developer Embark Studios to be its big selling point, some players are more concerned with the return of an item duplication exploit and how it has affected the in-game (duck) economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqb1oq/evidence_of_a_bp_duplication_glitch_in_matches_we/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no doubt</a> using the dupe glitch to amass piles of rare items like blueprints, it seems a few fans are manipulating the system to make some serious coin – and maybe even a quick joke. The duck has slowly become a bit of a running gag for fans on its own, as the squeaky bath toy is one of a few lightweight trinkets that can be found topside and then sold in Speranza for a decent chunk of Raider Coins. It also happens to be the sillier items in Arc Raiders, so when a recently patched dupe glitched returned in a new form, those looking to exploit the system knew just what to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who are discovering topside players with hundreds of ducks, however, are just confused.</p><p>Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/what_the_duck_is_this_we_found_two_dead_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a> a few days before the launch of Headwinds. “Dupe hacking gone wild? At first we thought it was some joke because the stash was just full of ducks but then we realized they were stacks of 15 ducks each.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Okay so I actually came across a guy in blue gate in a random house just spamming ducks on the ground,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/comment/o1lccl2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “I assumed he was duping. The floor was littered with them, probably like 100 of them. He wouldn't respond and kinda just stared at me til I walked away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders’ mallard problem has only gotten bigger in the aftermath of Headwinds, as the January content update also introduced a handful of more valuable (and more vibrant) ducks to collect as part of the new Bird City map condition. It’s resulted in an abundance of ducks across Buried City…and some very awkward moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A raider caught on fire in Buried City Metro, went down without saying a word, and left behind a mountain of Familiar Ducks,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqv3yd/a_raider_caught_on_fire_in_buried_city_metro_went/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user shared</u></a>. “I extracted with $2.8M. Still confused.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Was doing the pharmacist quest for Lance, heard the tell tale duck noise...came upon this silent raider,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qpvg2q/random_encounter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>person said</u></a>, sharing a picture of a solo Raider standing alone in a dark attic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-and-the-finals-hit-by-extensive-coordinated-ddos-attacks-dev-says"><u>a recent cyber-attack</u></a> against Embark and Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qpvg2q/comment/o2cofp8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>someone replied</u></a>, “This must be what brought down the servers. DDOS (Duck Duplication on Server).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a game that constantly sees players backstabbing each other for a small chance to net worthwhile resources, it’s hard to deny the comedy in PvP players only finding stacks upon stacks of little rubber duckies. Still, it’s definitely the kind of thing Embark <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">promised to clean up earlier this month</a>. Players have complained of cheaters and exploiters in Arc Raiders for weeks, so as goofy as these issues are, they are still causing some players to worry that others have an unfair advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's especially concerning for those who have kept up with Arc Raiders updates since launch. Embark <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-12-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued update 1.12.0</a> January 20 and fixed a handful of exploits, including an item duplication glitch. It took less than a week for players to begin reporting what appears to be a new version of the exploit, and it's unclear how long it will take for the developers to publish a new patch or how many other glitches will be discovered in the meantime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders cheater crackdown has seen <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls">holes plugged in Stella Montis</a> to try and ward off wall explolits, while some players, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-tfue-hit-with-30-day-arc-raiders-ban-amid-cheater-purge-then-immediately-unbanned">like streamer Tfue</a>, have found themselves banned (and then unbanned) without notice. As Embark tries to bring cheats to a halt, players are still finding the fun both in and outside of the game. Some have even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/please-try-to-be-friendly-to-other-guests-arc-raiders-players-bombard-real-life-stella-montis-hotel-with-5-star-reviews">looked to the real-world Stella Montis hotel to leave positive reviews</a>.

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">ACNH</a> done got me again. It's like a transporter incident has sent me back to 2020 and I'm once again finding solace in New Horizons' custom design tool, slowly crafting Star Trek-related patterns for my own amusement, watching hours zoom by as I move a single 'pixel' one square to the left and check the result. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dartmonkey.bsky.social/post/3mdntjiik6k2h">It's a happy place.</a></p>
<p>I'm steadily turning my upstairs room into Ten Forward, although I'm painfully aware that in the game somewhere, there must be better furniture to customise and more accurate green drinks to craft, which I just haven't found yet. I've even taken to working through the dreary DLC, hoping to access more cool items. Send help.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I've been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a> for what feels like one hundred years, and I've JUST seen my first real indication that Uchikoshi is up to his usual nonsense. I knew he was, that crafty devil! It's so good, although I will say that A) it must have been a nightmare to review, and B) you can really tell where the frosting gets a bit thin. They've definitely shaved the plot almost to nothing in some places just to achieve the illusion of overall fullness. But, eh, I don't mind! The bits that aren't thin are pretty darn great, and there's more writing in this than I've probably read in a year.</p>
<p>Other than that, I bought a few cheapy games in the Steam Sale — <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862670/Shelldiver/">Shelldiver</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3069810/Rocket_Rats/">Rocket Rats</a>, most notably, from the same developer. They're well-polished little incremental games, and they very much give me the feeling that this developer has what amounts to a well-oiled factory machine for making incremental games in his head. I bet he can crank these out as soon as he has the inkling of a new idea. Honestly, I have such a huge respect for developers that can do that! Making games in a particular genre is like working out a muscle — it sucks and hurts and takes forever at first, but then it becomes second nature. Having the basic frameworks already built helps a lot, too!</p>
<p>Oh, god, I just read that the developer is only 25. Gonna go lie down and have an existential crisis. Gagonfe, if you're reading this, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I reckon it's pretty predictable what my games will be this week! After rolling credits on Dispatch, I know I'll be diving back in this weekend in an attempt to change up my ending and explore more of the what-ifs from my original playthrough. Knowing me, I'll likely rummage the eShop for some Telltale Games I may have missed out. Other than that, it's likely another weekend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> or finally starting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on my trusty 2DS when it arrives!</p>

<p>Made my way to chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, loving it! But being a confused antisocial military bad boy who somehow is the love interest of three brilliant non-existent women is not the only fun way to spend the weekend: I have picked up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/283160/House_of_the_Dying_Sun/">House of the Dying Sun</a> on PC, and it is brilliant! I always loved the <strong>Starblade</strong> / <strong>Star Fox</strong> untextured polygon aesthetic, and this game takes it to the absolute extreme with combined fleet micro management. <strong>Rumble Roses XX</strong> is proving to be a rather solid wrestling title, but a bit too much of a grind for my tastes. It will take me forever to unlock the playable roster, but it does help that I was a fan of the PS2 original. It remains better than the current Switch 2 offerings.</p>
<p>My game of the week is GRID Legends: Gold Edition. I will finally fully recover my investment on the GameCube controller for Switch 2 because no way I will ever play this without the analogue triggers. I was oblivious that the story mode for this uses old-school full-motion video and actors, which gives it a bit of nostalgic charm. I will be spending the next few weeks quite entertained in the virtual tarmac.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Last week was good timing for picking up a copy of Tomodachi Life, eh? Yes, I've been diving back into the 3DS original over the last few days, and I had forgotten how much I love this silly little game! I've scanned in all of the celebs (obviously), and have been dropping in every day to see what's happening with Reggie, Shaq, Christina Aguilera, Miyamoto and... Zendaya? I caught Aonuma rolling around his apartment floor the other day. GOTY stuff, right there.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>While a chunk of my time has been spent playing a game for review (more on that next week), Animal Crossing has taken up most of my Switch 2 gaming. We've been snowed in basically all week here in central Ohio, so not much good trying to go out and have a social life.</p>
<p>But I've mainly been catching up on an RPG white whale, which I'm shocked isn't on Switch: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/valkyrie_profile">Valkyrie Profile</a>. What a weird, cool game — triAce esoterica aside, I love the tone and combat here. It's perfect for handheld play. Thank goodness for the PlayStation Portal... I'm eyeing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, but February is looking stacked. So we'll see. Keep warm, folks!</p>

            <guid>1421638</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed the first major collaboration between Escape from Tarkov and another game, and it’s been brewing for weeks. In a post on social media, the team unveiled the ‘Escape from Tarkov x Escape from Duckov’ crossover event, and while nobody knows what it entails, it was promised that it’s <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<p>In the last few weeks, we’ve seen teasers posted by both Battlestate Games and Team Soda, the developer behind the satirical extraction shooter, Escape from Duckov. Now it’s time to make good on those teases.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-duckov-is-coming-to-tarkov">Escape from Duckov is Coming to Tarkov</h2>



<p>A new image posted on social media confirmed that the Escape from Duckov and Escape from <strong>Tarkov </strong>crossover is indeed happening. We don’t know <strong>when</strong>, but the team at Battlestate Games promised it would be <strong>soon</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s just over a year since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/">Escape from Duckov</a> was released, emerging as a jokey extraction game that amassed a very real and surprising audience. It plunges players into a hardcore extraction concept populated by birds, mostly ducks, and gives them all the tools of the trade that we’d usually associate with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>That means customizable weapons, vendors, multiple maps, a hideout to build, and multiple quests.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What started as something of a joke has become something much more tangible, and now Escape from Tarkov’s developers are open to making Duckov the sole target of the first-ever cross-game collaboration in the EFT space.</p>



<p>While we don’t know what the crossover will include, fans have been quick to speculate on social media. Some are predicting seeing ducks running rampant around Tarkov’s maps, while others have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-crossover-teased-promo-code/">used earlier teasers</a> to guess that Tarkov’s bosses will be reimagined in Duckov as… Well, <em>ducks</em>.</p>



<p>And they’d be mostly right! On the <a href="https://x.com/GameDuckov/status/2017432651918131223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Duckov side</a>, it was confirmed that the collaboration arrives in <strong>that game </strong>on February 10, and it includes a new map, ‘festival content’, and Tarkov bosses reimagined in duck form. Happy days!</p>

<figure data-uuid="5cc6f40c0e93e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cc6f40c0e93e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>We heard recently from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi how the follow up games to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">Switch 2 would have "exactly the same" gameplay</a> as other platforms, so when exactly can we expect the next title?</p>
<p>Speaking to Polygon recently, Hamaguchi mentioned how a status update on the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will hopefully be shared in the "very near future". So far, this version of the game has been built, and the team is now working hard to optimise and polish it. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Polygon:</strong> "Hamaguchi’s next challenge is bringing <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> to Switch 2. Though <em>Remake</em> runs great on the console, <em>Rebirth</em> is a significantly larger game, complete with small but intricately detailed open-world zones. Hamaguchi says that the engineering team is handling that tall task well so far, to the point where the port is already far along in development."</p>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> “At this point, we have gotten the game built. Our engineers are working hard to optimize and to provide the final polish on the build. I’m hoping that we’ll be able to provide more information on <em>Rebirth</em> in the very near future. Compared to the first title, the world map is a lot larger, so there is no doubt that it’s a more challenging production process. But our engineers are very passionate about the work that they’re doing, so I’m confident that we’ll be able to deliver.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebirth was released on the PlayStation 5 in 2024. At the time, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> gave the title eight out of ten stars calling it a great sequel that retained all of the Remake's most important strengths while building on an already brilliant combat system, which excelled at showcasing the iconic RPG setting.</p>
<p>This update about the Switch 2 version of Rebirth follows the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade earlier this month on Nintendo's new hybrid system. A demo is also available on the Switch 2, if you want to test it out first.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/</link>
            <guid>1421629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Google's latest AI-based experiment, <strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/genie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Genie</a></strong>, has made a massive impression on users and investors alike. Google calls it a 'general purpose model' <strong>capable of swiftly creating photorealistic three-dimensional environments</strong> that can then be explored in a game-like fashion.</p>



<p>Anyone can test it out simply by writing a prompt. Of course, interaction is extremely limited: you can only move around and jump in these environments. Still, it is very impressive, to the point that <strong>it caused the stocks of many video game companies to crash</strong> as investors suddenly believed games would soon be made entirely with AI.</p>



<p><strong>Unity Technologies</strong>, the maker of the <strong>Unity Engine</strong> (one of the most used third-party game-making tools alongside <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>), went down by 18,80% yesterday. Epic Games is a private company, so it wasn't affected for obvious reasons.</p>



<p>Game developers and publishers also took a big hit. <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong>, the label behind Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, and NBA 2K, lost nearly 10%. <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>, the Polish developer behind The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077, fell by 8%. But <strong>Roblox Corporation</strong> had a sharper fall than both, losing over 13%.</p>



<p>Asian companies like <strong>CAPCOM</strong> or <strong>Tencent</strong> were barely affected, probably because the craze happened when their markets were already about to close on Friday. Still, this feels like a vast overreaction: Project Genie is just a glimpse into the future, rather than something anywhere near ready to replace properly made videogames.</p>



<p>Even so, Project Genie handles the rendering. Everything else would have to be added in by developers. That is, more or less, the vision <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a couple of years ago by NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, <strong>Bryan Catanzaro</strong></a>. Back then, the man behind DLSS imagined that <strong>DLSS "10"</strong> could render a game's entire visuals using AI-powered neural rendering, interfacing with a game engine to make it feel like an actual game. We might be heading toward that future, but there's no need for developers to fret - we'll still need them, that's for sure.</p>

<iframe title="Project Genie | Experimenting with infinite interactive worlds" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YxkGdX4WIBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Then there's the other side of this kind of AI: how do you stop copyright infringement? People have already recreated virtual worlds inspired by <strong>SEGA's Sonic</strong> and <strong>Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda</strong> with Project Genie.</p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, this would never fly outside of an experiment. If such technology were ever to be properly released, <strong>Google would need to implement strong guardrails to prevent the AI from directly infringing on copyrighted materials</strong>. Still, users would likely be able to create similar worlds while straying just far enough that the guardrails do not trigger.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Miami Heretics Kick Off Lower Bracket Run Hopes at CDL Major I]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/miami-heretics-cdl-major-i-elimination-run/</link>
            <guid>1421626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unfolding in Dallas, Texas, and waves are already being made. In the opening days of the competition, some hard eliminations were made, including Toronto KOI, the Carolina Royal Ravens, Vancouver Surge, Boston Breach, and Cloud9 New York.</p>



<p>The narrow majority of those eliminations came at the hands of the Miami Heretics, which kicked both Toronto and Vancouver out of the running for the grand prize. Miami Heretics has had a mixed season thus far, but a lower-bracket run could be in store for the squad.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-miami-heretics-run-through-the-elimination-bracket">Can Miami Heretics Run Through The Elimination Bracket?</h2>



<p>Miami Heretics came into Major I with fairly lacklustre stats. The team has managed to stump up a 3-4 match win record this season, sitting in ninth place out of the twelve teams going to bat this year. At the time of writing, Heretics sit between Toronto KOI and Boston Breach, fairly far down the CDL standings.</p>



<p>However, some kind of resolve tightening must have happened going into the event, as Heretics managed to cling on against Toronto KOI and eliminate the team after an extremely close 3-2 series. It was neck and neck the entire way, and the final round of Search was only separated by two rounds.</p>



<p>The series against Vancouver Surge was more of a wash. Heretics managed to eliminate Surge, currently the last-placed team in the rankings, without the latter managing to secure a single map.</p>



<p>Heretics will arguably face a much tougher test in the next series, as it’s going to be against either Paris Gentle Mates or the LA Thieves. The first- and fifth-placed teams respectively, and both the subject of massive overhauls during the recent off-season.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing this season of the Call of Duty League has proven thus far, it’s that it might be one of the hardest years of COD esports to judge. Presently, the top four teams boast an identical match win record: Gentle Mates, FaZe Vegas, Riyadh Falcons, and the Carolina Royal Ravens. That’s followed closely behind by LAT and OpTic.</p>



<p>As the year unfolds, we’ll see more of a separation hopefully surface, but for now, it’s really (almost) anyone’s game.</p>

            <guid>1421623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Just one day after the announcement of Genie, Google's generative AI-powered virtual world creator, a number of major video game companies are seeing their stock prices tumble, seemingly because some investors think you can just generate an entire video game with AI now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's not what Genie is. Genie essentially lets you create a virtual "world" by offering prompts to describe the environment, a main character, and first or third-person view. Once it's created, you can control the described character and wander around the world you've made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's...kind of it? While you can walk around these virtual spaces with your keyboard, critically, there's nothing else you can really do. There are no game mechanics, there's no one to talk to, no goals, no scores or meaningful interactions. Additionally, each generation is limited to just 60 seconds. And while you could maybe argue that this is just the first step on a road to eventually getting AI to generate playable 3D video games, there's no real evidence yet that such a thing is possible, or that the games would be good or even coherent. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a>, for instance, tried to basically copy Breath of the Wild using Genie, and while they got something that essentially looks identical, that's just it. It's not playable, the "Link" looks kind of frightening actually, and Genie had to copy something that already existed to make this. It didn't come up with this on its own. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that hasn't really stopped a lot of investors from suddenly jumping off the video game train, a conclusion first posed by <a href="https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unity-stock-falls-alongside-taketwo--roblox-after-googles-project-genie-launch-4429665" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investing.com</a> and shared by others, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdnsmltgmk2f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier</a>. Perhaps the most notable decline is Take-Two Interactive, which reached a six-month low this morning and, while it rallied somewhat by the closing bell, still ended down 8%. Engine maker Unity is in a similar spot, dropping 24% today also to a six-month low. Roblox stock also cratered today by 13% by close today, though notably Roblox has been on a downward trend since November. Still, it's a six-month low for Roblox, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every gaming company is seeing a massive nosedive. Ubisoft is technically down 7% today, but with its stock down to just $1/share, any small movement in either direction will seem significant. The company has been in pretty dire straits for months, even years now, and its announcement of more layoffs, closures, and cancelations earlier this month already had stock even further in a downward spiral. EA stock hasn't changed much today at all, but that's understandable, given EA announced last fall that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">it was preparing to sell</a> to an investor group headed up by the Saudi Arabian government and will soon exit the public trading market. Meanwhile, Nintendo stock, down just under 5% today at the time this piece was written, has been all over the place all month, following a steady downward trend since November. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The pattern I'm seeing here between Take-Two, Roblox, and Unity is a sudden distrust not in games as an idea, but rather concerns about "platforms". Unity is a game engine. People use it to make games. If Genie can also make games, who needs Unity? In Roblox's case, Roblox is a pure user-generated content (UGC) factory - something that would likely become obsolete quickly if Genie took over. And for Take-Two, the publisher is about to release Grand Theft Auto VI later this year (we hope), which would very likely be accompanied at launch or not long after with some new version of GTA Online. While the current GTA Online doesn't rely on UGC, there have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-launches-official-user-generated-content-marketplace-for-mods">recent suspicions this new version might</a>. Again, the thinking here is seemingly that if people can just make their own little games in Genie, why would they bother doing it in Roblox or GTA or Minecraft or Fortnite or Unreal or anywhere else (Microsoft, for its part is too big to see any stock impact from Genie today and Epic Games is not publicly traded).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is selling shares of major game publishers going to pay off for these investors? I'm not a stock expert, but if nothing else, it doesn't seem to be like a good idea to bet against GTA 6 right now (though Take-Two's earnings are next week, so we'll see I guess). And while Genie doesn't seem up to the task of making a whole video game out of nothing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">plenty</a> of other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-developer-jagex-insists-no-generative-ai-will-ever-be-present-in-any-asset-that-a-player-can-touch-hear-or-feel">studios</a> are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments">coming out</a> on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-publisher-defends-generative-ai-use-insists-every-game-company-is-now-using-it">one side of the fence</a> or the other on using generative AI of any kind in their work.

            <guid>1421617</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Two weeks ago, I happily attended my first-ever pre-release event for a new Magic: the Gathering set. This was for Lorwyn Eclipsed, which veteran players inform me is a long-awaited return to the fantasy stylings of Magic's Lorwyn plane after nearly 20 years. As you can imagine, there were a lot of long-time Magic fans who were <em>very</em> excited about this release, but in the minutes before my pre-release event began, I kept overhearing a tone of anxiety in the conversations around me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cause of the anxiety? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never been to a pre-release event, what happens is this: you're given a nice little box that contains several booster packs, which you will use to build a deck for the event and play some matches with other attendees. The boxes also tend to contain other goodies, which in the case of Lorwyn Eclipsed involved a deck box, a die, and a single foil card from the set. The foil you get is random, but it's <em>supposed</em> to come from the set you're there to play. And when I opened my box, that's what I encountered. A nice little foil of Shadow Urchin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the reason for the anxiety at the event was because word had gotten around that some people were <em>not</em> receiving Lorwyn cards as their foil promo card. Instead, a number of social media posts had been circulating showing players with six Lorwyn Eclipsed booster packs and one foil card from the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this is quite the mix-up! Not only is TMNT, uh, <em>very</em> different from Lorwyn, but the TMNT set isn't even supposed to be out yet. It's coming on March 6, just under two months from the date this was happening. So not only was this causing an issue for Lorwyn fans, but TMNT fans excited for the upcoming set were now getting previously unrevealed cards shown off via random social media posts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This situation also complicated the event itself: normally, a TMNT card would not be legal in a Lorwyn Eclipsed pre-release deck. Fortunately, Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3mclkkr2dka2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> pretty quickly about the situation, saying that stores should replace the TMNT promo cards where possible with Lorwyn cards. Where not possible, players would be allowed to play with the TMNT cards. That... sort of helps, but the fact is that Lorwyn Eclipsed cards are part of a set that's meant to be played together, with cards and mechanics that coordinate with one another to create a balanced game. A single TMNT card is more likely than not going to struggle to fit into decks like that. What's more, shops would have to break into unsold pre-release boxes to take out the replacement foil cards, which essentially just eats through inventory for no reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you could argue, it's just one card! Who cares! And that's fair. But another sentiment I heard both online and at the event I attended was that the turtle invasion felt like a slap in the face to veteran Magic players. Not only has the wait to return to Lorwyn been long, but some long-time players have grown frustrated at how many collaborations with outside IP (dubbed "Universes Beyond") Magic has been doing lately. Wizards has been doing these crossovers since 2020, though at the time Universes Beyond cards weren't planned to be made legal in the Standard format and many of the ones that followed were just reskins, making them fairly easy to put up with if you didn't want to see Transformers or Doctor Who in your Magic game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But starting last year with Final Fantasy, that changed. The wildly popular Final Fantasy set was dubbed Standard-legal, and this year, Magic is getting more Universes Beyond sets than ever before: TMNT in March, Marvel in June, The Hobbit in August, and Star Trek in November. That's four standard sets - more than Wizards is releasing of non-Universes Beyond sets, of which we are only getting three: Lorwyn Eclipsed, Secrets of Strixhaven, and Reality Fracture. This is a lot to keep up with both mentally and financially, and while you could argue there's no pressure to "keep up," there is if you play the game's Standard format, which always revolves around the most recently-released sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth noting that groups of fans aren't the only ones who are annoyed here. Recently, shareholders of Wizards' parent company, Hasbro, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set">filed a lawsuit against it</a>, alleging that it was overprinting sets of cards, thereby devaluing ones that already existed. In the suit, shareholders also claimed Hasbro had previously done some fairly manipulative things with Magic card sales to cover up shortfalls elsewhere in the company. Regardless of whether or not anything comes of the lawsuit, there are some pretty hefty accusations in the complaint that would understandably sow further distrust among those who already felt Magic was overplaying its hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, back to the pre-release event, you can imagine perhaps being a long-time Magic fan, excited for the return of Lorwyn, ready to play some games involving elves and fairies and merfolk, maybe rubbed the wrong way a bit by the sheer volume of Universes Beyond but trying not to let it bother them, only to open their pre-release pack and find "Michelangelo, Weirdness to 11" in shiny foil. Doesn't feel great. Heck, I've only been playing a year, and I breathed a sigh of relief when my pre-release pack (and, in fact, my entire card shop) was decidedly turtle-free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To their credit, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/on-turtles-faeries-and-the-lorwyn-eclipsed-prerelease" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards has acknowledged fan frustrations and is trying to make good</a>. In a lengthy blog post written by communications director Blake Rasmussen, he apologized for the "shell shock" of seeing a turtle in a Lorwyn box. "We wouldn't blame you if you found it cool, but maybe a bit rude, that Lorwyn Eclipsed had to share the spotlight with an upcoming set," the post reads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Wizards went ahead and updated its image gallery to include official art of all rares and mythic rares from the main set. "They're already out there if you know where to look, and we'd rather you have them all in one official place," the post reads. "It's ready for you now if you want to take a look."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rasmussen also announced plans for some sort of make-good event for the stores that had to deal with turtles at the event, though they weren't clear as to what that would look like just yet. Here's what he said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then, to keep the Lorwyn Eclipsed party going, we're going to do—something. We're playing catch up a bit and we wanted to get this article out sooner rather than later, but we're assessing how widespread the issue was and working on some kind of cool, back-end, Lorwyn Eclipsed-related thing we can do for affected stores because we're really proud of this set and we want to make sure it gets its time in the sun. We're going to figure said thing out and get back to you all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to this from the community has been mixed. A lot of people weren't mad about the turtles to begin with. Universes Beyond, some argue, is a great way to get new players into the hobby who might not have otherwise noticed Magic before. Some others who were annoyed with the turtles appear to have been pacified by Wizards' statement and response. Others still aren't happy, believing this is a symptom of a larger problem at Wizards (too much emphasis on Universes Beyond) and an overall lack of care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We won't really know where the community writ large's heart lies on the broader issues until later this year, when the Magic card deluge has fully arrived and we have a better idea of whether or not people are actually buying all these dang sets. As for Lorwyn Eclipsed, hopefully whatever Wizards is plotting to help assuage the affected stores is appropriately celebratory of Lorwyn, which frankly is a pretty cool setting. I ended up having a grand time at my pre-release event, and will probably attend future ones as a result, provided there are no horror stories of Borg showing up in Strixhaven. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s a relatively insubstantial update that targets quality-of-life issues across the experience, but one bullet point tucked under the “Player” changes section makes it clear the developers are still listening to fans as they move toward the delayed launch of Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one-sentence change says the Objective Ace and Winter Warning cosmetics will be altered to “better align with Battlefield’s visual identity.” It’s easy to miss but one of the more important changes Battlefield 6 has received in the last month, as it relates to two of the biggest controversies for the entry so far.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This definitely looks AI Generated right? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/VLYMhEMOqQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VLYMhEMOqQ</a></p>— Battlefield 6 News (@BF6Updates) <a href="https://twitter.com/BF6Updates/status/2002568867575705950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Winter Warning was perhaps the most infamous of the two cosmetics, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels"><u>drawing criticism from players who feared it had been generated using artificial intelligence</u></a>. Questionable features, such as unrealistic finger placement and, most notably, a double-barreled M4A1, were what first saw players cast accusations regarding the use of generative AI. In the time since conversation began in mid-December, players still reference Winter Warning as one example of their issues with Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Objective Ace Assault skin brought upon completely <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pzqhui/this_is_litteraly_a_cod_ghosts_mask/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>new issues when fans took notice of its mask’s resemblance to the logo for 2013’s Call of Duty: Ghosts</u></a> in late December.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/aniimo-preview-all-the-fun-of-creature-catching-with-all-the-transactions-of-gacha</link>
            <guid>1421608</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you say the words “creature collector,” you already have my attention. I’ve been both curious and wary in equal measures since Aniimo was first announced. I’m far from the only person hungering for a worthy competitor in the creature-collection, monster-taming space, and I’ve dabbled in quite a few. Aniimo looks particularly vibrant, vast, and cutesy to boot. It’s the addition of gacha elements that has had me a little on the fence. If you’ve ever sunk hours into a gacha, you understand the trepidation. Will this be the sort of gacha experience that has me gleefully forking over my credit card info, or resenting every microtransaction?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After about four hours with Aniimo, I’d say I’m still cautiously optimistic. It has all the ingredients of my favorite games: open-world exploration set in a fantastical alien world, lots of critters to collect, challenges to complete, and… farming? Okay, there might be a few too many ingredients added to this pot, but I’m willing to let Aniimo cook.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Big Butts, Tiny Waist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We leap straight into creating our Aniimo character. I can easily sink hours into a good character creator, so I was pumped to give Aniimo’s a try. From the get-go, the character creator feels super in-depth. I was given six default presets for both a “male” and “female” avatar (not great for all my non-binary pals). You can combine up to three different face presets to get something a little different, or you could just dive head first into the face customization options.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Aniimo Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aniimo’s character creation allows you to adjust the position, prominence, and size of pretty much every facial feature, from your nasal wings to your eyelids. However, it didn’t take me long before I noticed one glaring oversight: skin tone. After searching for a bit, I finally found the options for skin tone buried under all the other menus for “makeup”. Don’t let the three default options take you aback - like it did me - Aniimo won a bunch of points in my book by including a color wheel for unlimited skin tone options.</p><p>Aniimo won a bunch of points in my book by including a color wheel for unlimited skin tone options.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the character customization lost me again in two areas: one, hair options are <em>extremely </em>limited. I can only assume - based on the “fashion” vouchers I saw redeemable later on in my playthrough - that you unlock more hairstyles through in-game currency or progression. Having appearance and cosmetics locked behind gacha mechanics might be expected. The fact that there is only one natural curly hair option - if you can even call it that - available from the start, however, is frankly disheartening.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And second, I was similarly disappointed in the body customization. While I had so much control over fine-tuning the shape of my face, the sliders for body proportions were lacking to say the least. I never expect much in terms of body diversity when it comes to this genre of game, but having to choose between being eerily thin or skinny with a nice butt and boobs was disconcerting.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Which Aniimo Are You?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With character customization out of the way, I got my first look at my in-game self - and the adorable Aniimo! - in a cutscene reminiscent of a Twitch “IRL” livestream. The livestream overlay, complete with “real-time” chat bubbles from fictional viewers, threw me off a little bit, but luckily, we didn’t linger in the social media influencer realm for long. I found myself in the alien world of “Idyll”, an aptly named "idyllic" planet teeming with lush greenery and charming wildlife with unique powers, called Aniimo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first Aniimo crosses our path - an adorable little fire-type Emberpup - smoothly introducing catch mechanics I’m already plenty familiar with. With an Emberpup at my side, my friend Nico laid down the basics of commanding Aniimo to use their abilities to remove obstacles or solve puzzles in the world. After catching a few more Aniimo and commanding my new pals to charge into deadly combat, the story began in earnest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BINI, our little robo companion, is abruptly hijacked by a mysterious glowing D20 die, which pulls me and Nico into some sort of pocket dimension. In these strange ruins, I encountered murals on the wall depicting Aniimo I’ve yet to encounter. Each mural poses a cryptic question, ala a Buzzfeed personality quiz. The reason for this soul-searching became clear once I reached the glowing mural at the end of the path. The depictions of a yellow lion and blue fox in this mural materialized into two tiny Aniimo who can… talk? I was recommended to choose between Helion or Lunara, based on how I answered the murals’ questions earlier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I really liked being offered a “sorting quiz” to guide me towards which “starter” Aniimo I should choose. After all, the “starter” you choose clearly says so much about you. Only having two options to choose from was a little unsatisfying, though it appears to tie into some sort of “sun and moon” mythology which could be central to Aniimo’s story. I went for Helion, personally, not only because he was recommended, but because of his sassy little personality. With Helion by my side, I was thrown into combat with my first big foe: a giant armored dragon Aniimo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combat was fun enough for my tastes, if a little button-mashy. I can imagine that timing your dodges and managing your cooldowns might take some deeper consideration as you progress. What really impressed me was the Twining mechanic. Yup, in Aniimo, you actually get to <em>be</em> the creatures. Playing as Helion - rather than just sitting back as a trainer - made for some engaging, brawly combat.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Getting Schooled</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as quickly as I was transformed into Helion and defeated the dragon-type Aniimo, I was thrust into a whole new region. I found myself transported to the Polaris Institute, a futuristic academy devoted to studying Aniimo, located on my home planet of Astra. At this stage of the tutorial, things became a little bogged down in dialogue and instructional demos. To continue my adventure, I needed to become an official student at the Polaris Institute, instead of just a particularly precocious livestreamer, or whatever I was doing before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To qualify to be a student, I was strong-armed into a combat simulation, which broke down the bare bones of accumulating “EP” and how to choose Aniimo that are elemental counters. Next up, I received my first free outfit - a school uniform - and sat through a quick Character menu breakdown. When I was finally teleported back down to Idyll with this hot anime guy and his hot wolf Aniimo - don’t judge me, you <em>know</em> that’s exactly what they were going for here - I hunkered down for another round of tutorials. After using the Report Terminal and building my Aniimo loadout, I finally had my first taste of exploration.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Creatures</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where I could start to see myself becoming hooked on Aniimo. There’s something so intrinsically appealing about running around a beautiful countryside and stopping to look at every shiny thing on the ground. There are fast travel spots to discover, new areas of the map to unveil, treasure chests to find, and most importantly, Aniimo to catch!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became clear that catching Aniimo has a bigger role to play than simply filling out your Aniilog or battling other Aniimo. Depending on their elemental type or other abilities, I relied on my Aniimo to help me solve environmental puzzles, like excavating buried treasure chests or floating on geysers of air. Getting to transform or “twine” with my Aniimo had me squealing with joy. Who doesn’t want to be a tiny little rock crab, walking through a field of flowers?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I quickly discovered how foundational the first Aniimo I caught were, as I swam across streams as Skippy, burned thorny obstacles with Emberpup, or glided around as Celestis. This gave me plenty of motivation to constantly be swapping around my “team” of Aniimo for a reason other than battle prowess. As I discovered later, even keeping starter evolutions - or “Lumin” stage - Aniimo is integral to completing some of the challenges and puzzles scattered around Idyll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent a lot of time wandering around the map, catching new Aniimo, and collecting Lumin Amber to upgrade the Branch, a giant dandelion which improves the capture chance in that region, and completing miscellaneous milestone tasks, called “Elite Training”. These tasks felt a bit like chores: open “x” amount of chests, hatch “y” eggs, and so on, but completing them did fast track my level quickly while giving me a solid understanding of the core mechanics of Aniimo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/cubbo4-1769793781632.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the Aniimo I caught while exploring were super cute, if a little… bland. I love some whimsy in my creature-collectors, a healthy mixture of adorable critters with some cursed-looking monstrosities. What’s neat about Aniimo, however, is that there seems to be a bunch of variations in each type. Most Aniimo have branching options for their second or final “stage” of evolution, and on top of the rare “Prismana” Aniimo which can be caught, I found a few fun “alternative” versions with different appearances based around the region I found them in.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">#VanLife Influencer Era</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A few hours into my playtime with Aniimo, I stumbled upon another of its key features: the RV. After discovering this NPC in the middle of a field, I abruptly found myself the proud owner of my own interdimensional RV. After a quick customization, I was prompted to teleport to the nearest “RV Park”. This vibrant campsite seems to be some sort of meeting place where you can get together with other Aniimo players and show off your own little outdoor deck.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/malangel-1769793842657.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As an aside, it wasn’t until I found the RV Park that I discovered that while - no, you cannot pet your Aniimo (boo) - you <em>can</em> pick up the Aniimo. Huh. That revelation made, I stepped through the interdimensional door in the back of my new RV and entered the “Homeland Space.” I assumed that this would be some sort of home-building mechanic, perhaps allowing me to decorate my own little space or interact with my Aniimo. Instead, I found myself on a small patch of barren farmland.</p><p>While no, you cannot pet your Aniimo (boo), you can pick up the Aniimo. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Homeland tutorial had me clearing up the farm’s clutter and sowing my first seeds. Once grown, I was able to harvest my crops to sell. As reward, I received “Home Coins,” a currency I can only assume is unique to the Homeland section of Aniimo. With only this brief experience to go off of, I’m guessing that the Homeland farming is meant to be a sort of supplemental gameplay element which will let me idly generate currency every day. In exchange for my Home Coins, it appears that I can trade for other important in-game items, such as Eggs, or purchase “RV Welcome Packages”, which I’m hoping offer plenty of RV furniture and customization.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/susuta2-1769793861500.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, the RV and Homeland feel a little discordant with the rest of my Aniimo experience. I love a good farming sim, but I cannot see myself motivated to spend time planting and selling crops every day if my only reward is just a slow grind to purchasing rare materials. Completing order requests just for extra Home Coins and coupons for RV furniture feels like it would quickly become a slog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, I was pleasantly surprised during my time playing Aniimo. This is exactly the type of game I can see myself sinking hours into exploration and creature-collecting. The Aniimo were super adorable, and getting to play <em>as</em> the creatures you’re collecting is novel enough in itself to keep me interested. In some other areas, including the main story, Aniimo does feel admittedly empty or bland. I don’t imagine I’ll be filling out my entire Aniilog or progressing far enough to reach late-game mechanics. I’m still hyped to download Aniimo on my PC - maybe even on my mobile or Xbox Series X|S - when it releases, so I can run around as a little Nimbi once again.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/aniimo-preview-all-the-fun-of-creature-catching-with-all-the-transactions-of-gacha]]></content:encoded>

But Morrowind — considered by many to be the greatest The Elder Scrolls game ever released — does not seem to be part of the remaster conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? In an interview with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Press Box PR</a>, Bruce Nesmith, who left Bethesda in 2021 midway through the development of Starfield having worked at the company for over 17 years, highlighted a number of reasons why Morrowind probably won’t be top of Todd Howard’s remaster list.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The problem with doing Morrowind is that I bet they don’t have the original code,” Nesmith said. “The game is so old. I don’t know if the original source code exists anymore. If it does, can you even compile it? When you’re looking at Oblivion, they still had the code. They could still compile it. Putting the code into the new version of the engine was a possibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other thing I would say is go back and play Morrowind and tell me that’s the game you want to play again. We all have these fond memories of things that were pivotal moments in our gaming fantasy histories that we absolutely move but you go back and play a 20 year old game and you will cringe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People even had cringe moments with the Oblivion remake but they forgave it because they’re reliving something, they’re enjoying the nostalgia. I worked on Oblivion. I’m even responsible for some of those cringe moments! The further back you go, the more that’s going to be an issue. The reality of playing Morrowind would not stand the test of time, in my opinion. </p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now if you were to completely remake Morrowind with the Skyrim engine, to try and rebuild it from the ground up, that’s a whole other story, but that’s an entire project. That’s a whole four-year development cycle. Why not go and make something new?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let's revisit the lands of Morrowind and do a new story. You can include the giant crab palace and all of that stuff but make it new and avoid all the things that would not have survived the test of time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On that point, Nesmith suggested Morrowind could be an area Bethesda returns to in another game, perhaps The Elder Scrolls 6, alongside Hammerfell, High Rock, and Summerset Isle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If anything, there's places that would be too interesting,” Nesmith suggested. “I think Elsweyr would be a challenge with its cat people who change the nature of their catness as they mature. That one might be a little challenging to do. But I think pretty much anywhere you go, there's lots of cool, interesting stuff you could do.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-reveals-his-idea-for-the-elder-scrolls-6-story-and-how-it-would-have-set-up-elder-scrolls-7">Bethesda’s former Elder Scrolls loremaster revealed his idea for <u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u> story, and how it would have set up The Elder Scrolls 7</a>.

              <p>Early today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/epstein-drop-live-00757275">the Department of Justice released more than three million pages</a> of files connected to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And as people have started digging into all the new emails and documents, we are learning a lot more about Epstein and his elite inner circle. Oh, and apparently, he would sometimes send people links to porn featuring characters from <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em>.</p> <p>On May 4, 2017, Epstein sent a message to Karyna Shuliak, his last known girlfriend, that simply contained a link to an animated gif uploaded to 4chan that featured multiple characters from <em>FNAF</em> engaging in sexual activities. The animation was apparently made in Source Filmmaker and was shared on 4chan in April 2017. Epstein simply commented “amazing animations” in the subject line of the email.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02328259.pdf">This 2017 email</a>, as well as others from the Epstein files purporting to show him sending <em>FNAF</em> porn he found online to Shuliak, spread across social media <a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/2017398693834420299?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">as part of a collage image</a>. Many assumed it was a joke. But <em>Kotaku</em> and others online have been able to verify that the 2017 email did include <a href="https://archived.moe/gif/thread/10501788">a link to this NSFW 4chan gif post</a>.</p> <p>Discovering that Epstein looked at and shared porn based on the horror game <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> is <em>far</em> from the worst piece of information to come out of the Epstein emails. But it is a strange piece of information I didn’t know before, and now I do. I can’t stop thinking about him writing “amazing animations” in the subject line as he emailed the link to his girlfriend. We live in a weird, horrible timeline, huh?</p> <p>In other Epstein video game news (because yes, there is more), <a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660">he was banned from Xbox Live in 2013</a> after Microsoft figured out he was a registered sex offender.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-season-dates-seemingly-leaked/</link>
            <guid>1421572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a>, 2K Sports is leaving the traditional DLC packs in the past in favor of a new Ringside Pass. </p>



<p>This new pass is WWE 2K26’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-is-going-to-have-a-ringside-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">version of the Battle Pass system</a> that has made its way to all sorts of games over the years. The Ringside Pass will offer players 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers to unlock. With the Ringside pass, players who reach tier 40 each season will be able to unlock new wrestlers, customization options, exclusive content, and more. </p>







<p><strong>“The Ringside Pass Premium replaces the previous DLC model, rewarding players with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-new playable characters</a> unavailable on the base game roster, including current Superstars, Legends, Personas, and some unexpected names,”</strong> 2K Sports said. </p>



<p>2K Sports is going to roll out the Ringside Pass in seasons throughout the game’s year on the market. The first season is scheduled for launch day with five others planned in the following months. And, now, thanks to the Nintendo eshop, those five other season dates have seemingly been leaked.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-season-release">WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Season Release</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the first season will come on launch day–for King of Kings, Attitude Era, and Monday Night War Edition owners—on March 6. </p>



<p>Season 2 is scheduled for May 4; Season 3, June 29; Season 4, August 24; Season 5, October 19; and Season 6, December 14. </p>







<p>While we have the dates, specific details of what’s included in each season has yet to be announced. Those will come as each season approaches. </p>



<p>WWE 2K26 promises the largest roster in the history of the franchise with over 400 playable characters. With the Ringside Pass, 2K says players will have more options than ever before in a WWE game.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 launches globally for all players on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Early today, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/epstein-drop-live-00757275">the Department of Justice released more than three million pages</a> connected to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And as people have started digging into all the new emails and documents, we are learning a lot more about Epstein, his elite inner circle, and also that apparently he was banned from Xbox Live over a decade ago.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href="https://archive.is/o/VHGL6/https://xboxera.com/2026/01/30/jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-on-xbox-live/"><em>Xbox Era</em> spotted an email from December 2013</a> sent from Microsoft and Xbox Live to an email address used by Epstein in many of his illicit communications. The email was letting the then-alive mogul and convicted rapist know that his Xbox account had been banned permanently due to “harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players.” That might make you think that Epstein was using his Xbox Live account to do some heinous shit, but a follow-up email from Xbox a few hours later explains exactly why he was banned.</p> <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01944468.pdf">Epstein was banned because he was a registered sex offender</a>, and Xbox works with law enforcement to keep these kinds of people off its gaming network. While Epstein had been a registered sex offender for years at this point, another email spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871425/jeffrey-epstein-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-sex-offender"><em>The Verge</em></a> seems to indicate he didn’t create an Xbox account until <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00668878.pdf">October 2012</a>. Microsoft joined a New York-led legal initiative to remove registered sex offenders from online platforms in April 2012. So it took some time before Xbox caught Epstein and kicked him from the service.</p> <p>It’s unclear if Epstein actually used his Xbox Live account to play games. Other emails revealed in today’s massive dump include him asking about an<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02101088.pdf"> Xbox 360 Kinect in 2014</a>. Another message from 2019 has him asking: “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02265766.pdf">Why is there a $25.24 charge on Xbox?</a>“</p>

<p>In this update, which follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">a comment it made to Nintendo Life earlier this week</a>, the studio says the superhero workplace comedy game didn't meet Nintendo's content guidelines.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the good news is that the team is already supposedly working with Nintendo on a path forward to "address at least some of the censored content". It can't make any specific promises, but fans can apparently expect an update in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nymhqz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1qremvk/adhocs_statement_on_switch_censorship/">full statement from AdHoc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been quiet for the last few days not because we don’t want to address this stuff, but because we’ve been trying to make sure we’re being good partners with Nintendo. They’ve made their own statement regarding this issue:</p>
<p>“<em>Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations.</em>”</p>
<p>As Nintendo states, any game that’s going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to ‘meet [Nintendo’s] established content and platform guidelines.’ This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn’t meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That’s what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we’re the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms.</p>
<p>We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved.</p>
<p>Where we absolutely need to take full ownership is the placement of that disclaimer. Again, it was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. While we didn’t have complete control of the language, we did have control of the placement. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled “Disclaimer”, instead of the “About The Game” section. We didn’t catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it.</p>
<p>This is 100% our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We’ve also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review.</p>
<p>So what now?</p>
<p>We’re already working with Nintendo on a path forward. While we can’t make any specific promises just yet, we’re confident we’ll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content. I’ll get ahead of it now and say that between dev time and the console submission process, we’re talking weeks not days.</p>
<p>To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we’re truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon.</p>

Microsoft joined <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/sex-offender-video-game-ban-operation-game-over-ny/1975448/">New York state’s initiative to purge sex offenders from online platforms</a> where they might bump into children back in April 2012, so it seems it didn’t ban his account for over a year.</p></div><p>It’s not clear if Epstein played Xbox himself, though. In July 2014, he asks his executive assistant <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02101088.pdf">“do we have an xbox 360 kinect?”</a> and in 2016 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02198968.pdf">this email</a> appears to be a discussion of buying an Xbox as a surprise birthday gift for a boy.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/respawn-entertainment/" id="95172">Respawn Entertainment</a>, via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">EA</a>‘s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/update-on-nintendo-switch-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, announced that season 29 will be the final update for Nintendo Switch, with all future updates continuing on the console’s successor. Season 30 begins on August 4.</p>



<p>The development team stressed that all progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to players’ individual EA accounts, and everything will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, regardless of when you purchase the console. It also stressed that the game will continue to be supported on all other platforms and that the reason for the switch, no pun intended, is to deliver the best possible experience and utilize the power of the Switch 2.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard </a>has added a new gameplay mode, now available to play.</p>



<p>Highguard has added a 5v5 Raid Mode. The mode is now live, but it will be available for a limited time. The mode is experimental and is only playable this weekend. It’s a separate playlist and will not replace the 3v3 raids.</p>



<p>Lobbies have been updated to allow for parties of 5 for the weekend. Additionally, in this mode, Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6, and respawns are slightly longer to allow for generators to be planted or diffused.</p>



<p>A new base has also been added to Highguard. In addition to the new game mode, they have also added a new base, Soul Well. Described as a dark relic from a lost age, the new base has been added to the rotation in all game modes.</p>







<h2 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements-are-also-coming-to-highguard-in-this-patch">Quality-Of-Life Improvements Are Also Coming to Highguard in This Patch</h2>



<p>Additionally, there are several updates for optimization and quality of life. Several optimizations improve animation performance, projectile behavior, and other gameplay systems. These updates benefit both console and PC and will also include features such as a motion blur toggle.</p>



<p>The developers note that players in 3v3 playlists should see some improvements, but they ask for some leeway during testing of the new game mode. Also, Firing Range does not currently support 5v5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The stock prices of some major video game companies, including Take-Two Interactive, Roblox, and Unity, had notable declines on Friday, just a day after Google announced its Project Genie tool that lets users prompt AI to generate interactive experiences, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/videogame-stocks-slide-googles-ai-model-that-turns-prompts-into-playable-worlds-2026-01-30/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a>. Take-Two’s stock price closed at $220.30 (down 7.93 percent from yesterday), Roblox’s closed at $65.76 (down 13.17 percent), and Unity’s closed at $29.10 (down 24.22 percent).</p><p>Other AI tools have received significant pushback from artists and creators over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/864951/human-artistry-campaign-ai-licensing-artists">allegations of theft</a> of their work to train the underlying AI models, AI’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845831/ai-chips-data-center-power-water">water and electricity usage</a>, and what this means for creative output. Google DeepMind’s Diego Rivas told <em>The Verge</em> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718723/google-ai-genie-3-model-video-game-worlds-real-time">Genie 3</a>, the AI world model powering Project Genie, was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web,” and <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15391v1">a white paper</a> from Google DeepMind researchers about the first Genie model said that it was trained from “a large dataset of over 200,000 hours of publicly available Internet gaming videos.”</p><p>Many game developers are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey">very skeptical of generative AI</a> and its hand in seemingly ripping off existing works to let people create AI slop. The <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>-like worlds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on">I was able to create</a> from prompts with Project Genie somewhat resembled Nintendo’s actual games, but the experiences didn’t have any of the fun or playability of the originals. For an industry already grappling with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games">wave</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">wave</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">wave</a> of layoffs, even the current form of Project Genie represents a pitch to replace work like testing and concept building.</p><p>The version of Project Genie Google presented this week can only make interactive experiences that are 60 seconds long. They have no scores, objectives, or even sound. They can have strange errors and inconsistencies, like a racetrack road unexpectedly turning into grass. When you’re done with an experience, you can only download a video of it or generate a new one; you can’t take what you’ve made in Project Genie and slot it into a traditional game development tool like Unreal Engine or Unity.</p><p>But the push by investors and executives for AI game creation tools is already being spelled out. xAI CEO Elon Musk has <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2016876797682467277/">promised</a> “Real-time, high-quality shows and video games at scale, customized to the individual, next year.” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2017327913113190789">said Friday that</a> “We’ll see constant leapfrogging between engine centric AI and world model centric AI until they come together for maximum effect.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went long on the company’s earnings call this week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869882/mark-zuckerberg-meta-earnings-q4-2025">about how</a> AI will help games feel “more immersive and interactive,” making his comments just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/861420/meta-reality-labs-layoffs-vr-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-armature">shutting down VR game studios and projects</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/871348/google-project-genie-take-two-roblox-unity]]></content:encoded>
