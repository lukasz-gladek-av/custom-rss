			<p>Today, Electronic Arts <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that skate would launch next year in early access. The fourth mainline installment in the extreme sports series is in development at Vancouver-based studio Full Circle and has already been playtested by 'tens of thousands' of PC gamers over the last couple of years. Console playtesting is set to begin this Fall.</p>
<p>Last we heard from the studio, they were making a series of changes based on the feedback gathered from playtesters:</p>
<p><em>We’ve done a ton of work rebuilding Flick-It, skate.'s core trick control system. We want to make sure every trick feels fun and satisfying, while delivering the familiarity from past Skate games. On top of that, we’ve improved accuracy and control to make learning tricks easier.</em></p>
<p><em>The team is also hard at work to give you the tools to have fun your way, by yourself or with friends, anywhere in San Vansterdam. Almost everything you do in the game will earn you rewards, so you can customize your character, setup, and even unlock new objects to place and skate in San Van.</em></p>
<p><em>Self-expression is what skateboarding’s all about, which is why we’re stoked to bring in as many character customization options as possible to skate. Body types, hair, clothes, your board setup (including stickers!) — you’ll be able to tweak and style to your heart’s content.</em></p>
<p><em>What we’re most excited about with skate. is that we’re building a game that can live, grow, and change with you for years to come. Everything you’ve heard about so far — the city, its story, the gear, music, game modes, and more — will evolve as we go from season to season.</em></p>
<p>The game will employ a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free-to-play business mode</a>l and also include crossplay functionality across all platforms (PC, Mac OS, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and mobile devices). It's going to be '<a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always-on</a>', that is to say, a live service game persistently connected.</p>

            <p>As the end of the UK workday approaches, and the last few grains of sand trickle through the neck of the huge, obsidian hourglass our overlord Graham keeps on his desk, let me bid you goodbye by writing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/some-goodbyes-we-made">Some Goodbyes We Made</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Created by Safe Flight Games, it's an hour-long collection of 11 minigames which include pint-sized visual novels, platformers and free-standing character creators, all contained within a charming faux-desktop interface. As the title implies, each is about the act of saying farewell to something or someone - an old home, your university life, a friend you're no longer on good terms with. "You'll see how the protagonist preserves the sadness and profundity of their goodbyes through these minigames, and feel the unique complexity, heartache, or beauty of each one," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705820/Some_Goodbyes_We_Made/">the Steam page</a>, perhaps a bit heavy-handedly.</p>
<p>While they're obviously going square for the emoti-glands, the games appear quite mischievous in style. There's one in which you wave frantically with the mouse cursor while your train pulls away, and another that looks a little like Earthbound in which you are a kid raising hell during a house move.</p>
<p>Safe Flight's two developers are both alumni of New York University Game Center. I've played a lot of absorbing smaller experimental games from NYU Game Center grads. I also love the concept of a collection of endings - a sort of anti-demo disc, if you will. It reminds me a bit of John Thyer's micro-RPG <a href="https://farawaytimes.itch.io/facets">Facets</a>.</p>
<p>All that said, I'm not entirely sure I want to actually experience Some Goodbyes We Made - or at least, it's not a game I'd jump into offhandedly. The developers note that in the course of playing the game "you might also revisit the goodbyes of your own life", which is a kind thought, but I've said some goodbyes I don't personally want to revisit.</p>
<p>Still, I'm glad that this game exists and, given a certain amount of mental preparation, intrigued to see how they've pursued the concept across different genres. I wouldn't mind smashing together a compilation of ending sequences from other games, slotting the final mission from Mass Effect 2 in alongside the Death Egg Zone from Sonic 2, and challenging people who've played neither to make sense of it all. What would you put in yours? </p>
<p>Some Goodbyes We Made will launch on 25th October. And with that, dear reader, I will say not goodbye, but: see you tomorrow!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Healers are pretty invaluable in this game, and Qiqi is capable of outputting some big healing numbers. However, she’s arguably outperformed by others in the same role due to her long cooldowns and majority focus on healing. There’s a much more dependable and versatile healer to choose later on this list.</p><p>The right team can support Qiqi well enough though, and it’s easy for her to save the team right back when they’re on the brink of death. To top it all off, this short zombie girl is cute as a button and she’s the only Cryo user on this list. Those who enjoy Cryo elemental reactions, or simply like the character, will benefit from adding her to their teams.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-recommend-id="image://1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="878" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Diluc, a red-haired man with a hawk perched on his wrist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Diluc, a red-haired man with a hawk perched on his wrist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-recommend-id="image://1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="878" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Diluc, a red-haired man with a hawk perched on his wrist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If a Pyro user with a big sword is what you’re looking for, but you want someone more dependable than Dehya, you can’t go wrong with Diluc. He can pile on damage super easily, especially when his skill can be used three times in a row before cooldown and his Elemental Burst requires little energy to use.<br></p><p>I’ve found him to be a lot of fun to explore with too. His claymore breaks items down quickly, and the uptime of his skill makes it great for puzzles. There have certainly been stronger Pyro DPS introduced during the game’s lifetime, but Diluc is reliable and effective. You can’t go wrong with him.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-recommend-id="image://d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kequing stands in front of a building, a dog sat on the steps behind her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kequing stands in front of a building, a dog sat on the steps behind her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-recommend-id="image://d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kequing stands in front of a building, a dog sat on the steps behind her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In contrast to the slow and heavy claymore DPS so far, Keqing is a refreshingly quick Electro Sword character. Her attacks come in fast and with wide range, meshing well with AoE-based skill and burst moves. Pair her with a Dendro team to make great use of their plethora of Elemental Reactions.</p><p>I’d be remiss to not mention the practicality of her skill as well. Keqing can teleport to the mark left behind by the ability, making it great for combat in addition to exploring. I’m always tempted to keep her on my team solely to avoid some of the monotonous climbing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-recommend-id="image://7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mona casts some magic from beneath her very fetching hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mona casts some magic from beneath her very fetching hat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-recommend-id="image://7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mona casts some magic from beneath her very fetching hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s nothing quite as satisfying as seeing massive damage numbers over your enemies. Mona excels at making this happen thanks to an Elemental Burst that can drastically buff a follow-up attack. As a Hydro Catalyst character, she can constantly barrage with element damage and inflict the Wet status on enemies.<br></p><p>Her unique sprint that moves quicker over water is notably useful too. For those like me who love exploring but hate having to cross long stretches of water, Mona helps a lot. Just remember that she needs to start sprinting on land first before transitioning to the water.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-recommend-id="image://0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen showing Jean, a blonde woman with a dandelion in her hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character screen showing Jean, a blonde woman with a dandelion in her hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-recommend-id="image://0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen showing Jean, a blonde woman with a dandelion in her hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Remember when I said there was a better healer on this list? That title belongs to Jean. Not only does her Elemental Burst heal the entire party, but her first passive gives her normal attacks a 50 percent chance to heal the party as well. She can also easily slot into a DPS role thanks to her huge Anemo damage. Being able to launch enemies into the air for some impressive fall damage is the cherry on top.<br></p><p>Not many characters, much less healers, can match her versatility. There’s a good reason why Jean has remained a prominent healer choice in the community. <strong>If you’re a new player, this is actually who I recommend choosing.</strong> Even though I’m about to argue she’s not the best on this list, I do believe newcomers will benefit the most from having her on their teams. She’s great enough to carry you through the initial chapters to the more challenging endgame content like Spiral Abyss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Tighnari, who is holding one of his bunny ears." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Tighnari, who is holding one of his bunny ears." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Tighnari, who is holding one of his bunny ears." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Dendro element and its elemental reactions are pretty highly favored by the fan base, which already gives Tighnari an advantage. What cements him at the number one spot here is that he’s the best DPS from the Standard banner. He can set up elemental reactions quickly, and help dish out damage just as fast. Dendro-related puzzles are also made easy since you only need to charge up a bow attack to trigger them.<br></p><p>Tighnari might not be a great pick for you if you’re not a fan of bow weapons. I certainly hate using them whenever I decide to play <em>Genshin Impact</em> with a controller. What helps in Tighnari’s case is that his Elemental Skill distracts enemies and reduces the charge time for his next three shots. Even better is that his Elemental Burst, while dealing low damage, auto-targets and requires little energy to fill.

<p>Microsoft has announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/three-new-games-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three new games</a> are set to join Xbox Game Pass over the next week. However, it’s not just games coming to the service they announced. It <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/17/xbox-game-pass-september-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was also revealed</a> that nine games are leaving Xbox Game Pass soon, too.</p>



<p>The biggest games — as far as notoriety is concerned — leaving Xbox Game Pass soon are Valheim and Gotham Knights. However, those aren’t the only prominent titles being removed.</p>



<p>The full list of nine games are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gotham Knights&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Let’s Build a Zoo&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Loop Hero&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>My Time At Portia&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>PAW Patrol Grand Prix&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season&nbsp;(PC)</li>



<li><em>The Walking Dead: Season Two&nbsp;(PC)</em></li>



<li>Valheim&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>



<p>There is no specific date for when the games will be removed. As far as a reasoning, it’s likely due to various licensing agreements expiring between Microsoft and the publishers. Those who wish to keep playing them can buy them for update to 20% off as part of their Xbox Game Pass membership.</p>



<p>Do any of the nine games leaving Xbox Game Pass stand out to you? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/219/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<!-- cache hit 100:single/related:85bbd958f61f2602d1f075714a4df08c --><!-- empty -->
<p>Fans of ultra-viral mobile gaming hit <em>Flappy Bird</em> who were stunned by the game's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/at-height-of-popularity-creator-pulls-flappy-bird-from-app-stores/">sudden removal from the iOS App Store</a> 10 years ago were probably even more stunned by last week's <a href="https://x.com/flappy_bird/status/1834241698781630485">equally sudden announcement that <em>Flappy Bird</em> is coming back</a> with a raft of new characters and game modes. Unfortunately, the new version of <em>Flappy Bird</em> seems to be the result of a yearslong set of legal maneuvers by a crypto-adjacent game developer intent on taking the "Flappy Bird" name from the game's original creator, Dong Nguyen.
</p><p>"No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything," Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328">wrote on social media</a> over the weekend in his first post <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/825935290430742528">since 2017</a>. "I also don't support crypto," Nguyen added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything.<br>
I also don't support crypto.</p>
<p>— Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>"<em>Flappy Bird</em> was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," Nguyen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/creator-cites-addictiveness-discomfort-in-pulling-down-flappy-bird/">said in a 2014 interview</a> after removing the game from mobile app stores. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it’s best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It's gone forever."
</p><h2>“A decade-long, convoluted journey to get here”</h2>
<p>So how can another company release a game named <em>Flappy Bird</em> without Nguyen's approval or sale of the rights? Court filings show that a company called Gametech Holdings <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Dong%20Nguyen%20Ha%20%20">filed a "notice of opposition"</a> against Nguyen with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in late 2023, seeking to invalidate his claim on the "Flappy Bird" name. When Nguyen, who lives in Vietnam, didn't respond to that notice by November, the US Patent and Trademark Office entered a default judgment against him and officially canceled his trademark in January, allowing Gametech to legally claim the name.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>But Gametech's efforts to legally acquire the Flappy Bird name seem to go back much further than that. Back in 2014, an outfit called Mobile Media Partners <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86188824&amp;docId=AAU20140222151009&amp;linkId=18#docIndex=17&amp;page=1">tried to claim the Flappy Bird trademark</a> in a filing made mere days after Nguyen pulled the game from the App Store. Coincidentally enough, the specific New Jersey address listed by Mobile Media Partners on that 2014 application <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98007245">matches an address used by Gametech Holdings</a> in the paperwork for its 2023 legal efforts.</p>
<p>Mobile Media Partners' 2014 application makes reference to a (now-defunct) FlappyBirdReturns.com and asserts that the company had "reserved/acquired the name from Apple in their Apps Store [sic]." It also claims that "Flappy Bird" is "not being used by any other companies and/or people," taking quick advantage of Nguyen's decision to take the game down.</p>

<p>With this "evidence," the USPTO actually <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86188824&amp;docId=ORC20180311112708&amp;linkId=4#docIndex=3&amp;page=1">granted Mobile Media Partners a Flappy Bird trademark in 2018</a>, a fact that Gametech <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91287432&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=4">cited</a> in its successful 2023 opposition to Nguyen's use of the mark.</p>
<p>In a press release, a spokesperson for the newly formed Flappy Bird Foundation—which acquired the trademark from Gametech—summed this all up as "a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here." The new company said it also acquired the legal rights to <em>Piou Piou vs. Cactus</em>, a little-known 2011 web game that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CcAOnxYe6g">seems to have heavily inspired <em>Flappy Bird</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://flappybird.org/">newly launched FlappyBird.org website</a> proudly refers to "the decade-long mission" to revive the game, which "involved acquiring legal rights." The post also mentions "working with my predecessor to uncage me and re-hatch..." in phrasing that seems to imply a link to the original <em>Flappy Bird</em> but which could also reference the <em>Piou Piou vs. Cactus</em> acquisition.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that artificial intelligence has become indispensable to modern computer graphics, signaling a major shift in how visual technologies are built. Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference on September 11, Huang explained that AI is now integrated into the very foundation of graphical computing.</p><p dir="ltr">"We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," Huang said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720501-nvidia-corporation-nvda-ceo-jensen-huang-presents-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology" rel="nofollow ">Seeking Alpha</a>), noting that Nvidia uses AI to compute a small part of the image and infer the rest. "We compute one pixel, we infer the other 32... it looks photorealistic, and the image quality is incredible, the performance is incredible."</p><p dir="ltr">AI has been criticized for its energy consumption, but Huang argued that using it for graphics can reduce energy use. "Computing one pixel takes a lot of energy... inferencing the other 32 takes very little energy, and you can do it incredibly fast." Huang added there are "productivity gains" from using these methods to generate code, and the capacity for that is "just incredible."</p><p dir="ltr">Relatedly, Huang also emphasized AI's role in software development, particularly with code generation. "There's not one software engineer in our company today who doesn't use code generators," he said, predicting that AI-driven "digital engineers" would become standard across industries.</p><p dir="ltr">Nvidia's AI-based DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) boosts performance by generating extra frames. Sony is employing similar AI techniques with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro's</a> PSSR upscaling.</p><p dir="ltr">Huang concluded by outlining Nvidia's broader AI applications, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and digital biology. AI, he said, is transforming fields like drug discovery with computer-aided tools.</p><p dir="ltr">Nvidia's AI innovations are part of a growing and already-here trend, with <a href="https://unity.com/resources/gaming-report?isGated=false" rel="nofollow ">a Unity report</a> showing that 62% of game development studios now use AI, primarily in animation.</p>

		<p>If you were hoping to play Skate soon then we have both good and bad news. The good news is that the game is getting Early Access, the bad news is that no platforms have been announced and it will be sometime next year.</p>
<p>“Over the last two years, the team has welcomed tens of thousands of individual playtesters into the city of San Vansterdam via the PC version, with console playtesting set to come in the Fall 2024. Players can still sign up to become a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726673954360000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YIMaAtOtYmRQ-nMswVT9W">skate. Insider</a> today for a chance to playtest and help shape the future of skate.” said developers Full Circle.</p>


<p>EA have been keeping Skate (4) very much under wraps since it was announced way back in 2021, but some pre alpha footage has leaked out and found it’s way on to Twitter in 2022.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Skate 4 pre-alpha footage. This is in line with what I've heard about where the game is at from multiple people. They're trying to get the feel right, which is probably the most important aspect of a Skate game. <a href="https://t.co/AXNV2Agk6z">https://t.co/AXNV2Agk6z</a> <a href="https://t.co/nUINhghxLg">pic.twitter.com/nUINhghxLg</a></p>
<p>— Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1516906318757388288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2022</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see the game is quite a way off from being completed but we do get to see the character doing some flips, running about without the skateboard and attempting – and failing – a mid-air somersault.</p>

<p>EA have created Full Circle, a team dedicated to developing Skate 4. Daniel McCulloch, former general manager of Xbox Live and producer of Forza games, is leading the team.</p>
<p>“The fans wished Skate back into existence and we want them to feel involved in the process from development to game launch and beyond. We want them to feel like they are a part of Full Circle,” McCulloch said in a press release. “We’re all about having fun and making great games that people want to play with their friends. And, we’re looking for more developers to help us build compelling worlds for players to explore.”</p>
<p>Deran Chun and Chris “Cuz” Parry are heading up the creative team, both of them have worked on previous iterations of the franchise.</p>
<p>Skate 3 was released over fifteen&nbsp; years ago and our beloved Blair didn’t really enjoy it, <a href="http://<a href=">scoring it just 6/10 </a>and&nbsp; saying “There really isn’t much depth to be found with Skate 3, due to the short career mode and lacking extra features. Thankfully, the simplistic yet effective controls and the fun to be found in some of the challenges help somewhat. With Skate 3, we see that innovation can only last so long before it becomes uninspired and stale.”</p>

					<p>I wasn't interested in playing The Plucky Squire just by looking at the screenshots. I found the art style slightly peculiar, especially when the main character wasn't in the storybook. Reluctantly, I loaded up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627570/The_Plucky_Squire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game</a> and found myself having a great time once I got into it.</p>
<p>Immediately, you are greeted by a sea of color and vibrancy, and I feel like I've loaded up a kid's game. That statement isn't too far from the truth, but the game was fun to dive into. I went into this without knowing anything about the game.</p>
<p>From my first moment of interacting with The Plucky Squire, moving about and slashing my sword, I immediately felt as if I was playing the classic Zelda games, even with the abilities you could pick up and learn via Martina, the merchant. It felt very nostalgic and homey and gave me a sense of comfort playing as this little squire who felt like the classic hero of many people's childhoods.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Plucky-Squire-Screen-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Off the bat, I was drawn to Moonbeard as a character (again, reminding me of The Legend of Zelda) and Thrash, an adorable goblin accompanying you on your journey. You play as Jot, also known as The Plucky Squire, and it's up to you to travel to Tome Tower to stop the villain of the storybook you are the protagonist of, as he is sick of being the villain every single time. Instead, he wants to make the book about him, and since you are the idol of a child who owns these storybooks, it becomes your mission to travel through both 2D and 3D settings to stop him.</p>
<p>In some elements, the game reminded me much of It Takes Two, especially once you are ejected from the book and plunged into the real world of the child who adores you and your stories. The 3D elements are a mix of cartoonish and realistic, reminding me a lot of Toy Story. It had a nostalgic feel to it, being tiny and climbing around on a desk to survive, and that was an element in the game that I enjoyed a lot. Especially when it came to hiding from the beetles that Sam (the child) was keeping as pets. However, if you got too close and alerted the beetles, you died.</p>
<p>The range of characters was excellent, with Martina and Thrash being some of my favorites from the list of companions you encounter. Martina is the storefront of the game, which sells you abilities and art scrolls for bulbs, the in-game currency you collect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Plucky-Squire-Screen-3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Although I enjoyed The Plucky Squire's gameplay aspects, I lost attention during the game's storytelling. There was nothing wrong with the story; it just didn't captivate me the way it possibly would a younger audience. If possible, I would skip through the story as fast as possible to dive back into combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving, all of which were fantastic elements I enjoyed. I liked listening to the narrator's voice, and I felt that the narrator chosen for the game was brilliant and did great storytelling despite me not being immersed in the actual details.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire reminded me of many different games I've played throughout the years, and it instantly made me curious about the driving inspirations behind this game. Was it meant to be similar to the classic Zelda games, or was it meant to be a mixture of Cuphead and It Takes Two?</p>
<p>Despite the nostalgic feelings provided by the game, it stood firm on its own two feet. Overall, the game isn't too long and will only take a few hours. I loved the element of being able to purchase the concept art for Bulbs, as it provided an extra layer of immersion into the game and helped show you how certain characters or landscapes came to be.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire was a lot of fun, and the characters all provided their own levels of entertainment, especially Violet's commentary about being a 'side-character' in a book. They were all very well-thought-out characters, and each provided something different to the game. Whether they were giving instructions or providing comedic relief in tense moments, they all had their purpose, which I liked.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Plucky-Squire-Screen-16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This game was very well done and had a highly polished feel. One of the only gripes I had with it was navigating the menu, which felt as if it was tailored to controllers specifically. It made it a bit difficult for me as I was using a mouse and keyboard, but the actual gameplay wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire is an enjoyable experience that can be very casual, or you can have it on a slightly harder difficulty if you want to add a challenging aspect to it, too. The game is perfect for gamers of all ages and could serve as a great resource to get children into gaming as well as find ways to be creative.</p>
<p><em>Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher).</em></p>

					
					

<p>Although the game was a lot of fun and I enjoyed the actual gameplay elements of it, the story just didn't grab me. Initially, I was also deterred by the massively contrasting art styles and the finicky menus. Overall, the game is a pleasant experience, appropriate for gamers of all ages. If the story had some more flashy dramatics, it may have pulled me in earlier. The Plucky Squire is very evidently a product made with a lot of love, and you can tell that from the level of polish it has.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate-reboot-officially-coming-to-early-access-next-year.983346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot will finally launch into Early Access next year, although the studio doesn't provide a more specific timeframe for release than just "2025".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, EA development team Full Circle says it's "incredibly stoked" to reveal that&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>&nbsp;(or, to give it its proper formatting,&nbsp;<em>skate.</em>), "will be launching in Early Access in 2025".</p>
<p>The studio says more information will be forthcoming "in the coming months", so that's presumably when we'll learn which platforms the game will be available on, as well as what features we can expect from&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>'s Early Access launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-release-window-early-access-grinding.jpg?itok=ZPNquRDp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-release-window-early-access-grinding.jpg?itok=uxRmSl2W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is officially coming sometime in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Full Circle was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-is-happening-ea-forms-new-studio">originally formed back in early 2021</a>, specifically to work on what was then called&nbsp;<em>Skate 4</em>.</p>
<p>In August of that year, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-pc-release-confirmed-by-ea">PC release of the game was confirmed</a>, and in July 2022, some of the game's alpha features were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alpha-features-of-skate-4-leaked-from-early-play-testers">leaked by early playtesters</a>, including different control schemes, a fast-travel system, and crafting materials and blueprints, although it's not clear how much of that is still in the game.</p>
<p>Later in July, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play">announced</a> that the game would officially be titled&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>rather than&nbsp;<em>Skate 4</em>, and that it would be free-to-play across all platforms on which it appeared, with cross-play and cross-progression both fully supported.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the game will be released across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, which presumably means it'll be available on PS4 and Xbox One as well as current-gen platforms. No mention of the Nintendo Switch, although its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-talked-about successor</a> might get a look-in eventually.</p>

<p>We still don't have a concrete release date for&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, but EA and Full Circle say that they're expanding the game's playtesting to consoles later this fall, so we'll probably learn more about what shape the game is taking around then. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that the studio has no plans to make&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>anytime soon, and that the franchise as a whole will move "beyond linear, sequential" releases, offering "more options for players than ever before".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new blog post</a>, EA lays out the future of the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the studio says it sees&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>' future as "more than any one title". Future plans for the series include "cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games".</p>
<p>With regards to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>, it looks like EA is planning to stick with&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>for the foreseeable future. The studio says the game will "continue to be a foundational&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>experience", although it will receive "continued depth, improvements, and modernization".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-ea-the-sims-4.jpg?itok=o1Se5gee 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-ea-the-sims-4.jpg?itok=zsu7lw6t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you've been hoping for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>, we've got some disappointing news for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>general manager Kate Gorman said she and EA want players to "continue all of those families and generations" that you've been following in&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>.</p>
<p>Creating&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>would mean "reset[ting] your progress", and Gorman says she wants to avoid this eventuality. She says the future of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>is all about "keeping your progress, keeping things across titles, and really having an ongoing experience".</p>
<p>So, what actually is in store for the future of&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>? Well, first up, EA confirms that&nbsp;the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>movie is very much real. It'll be directed by <i>Loki</i>'s Kate Herron and produced by Margot Robbie's company LuckyChap, in conjunction with Vertigo Entertainment.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>is getting Creator Kits, a set of packs made by&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>content creators that will deliver "creator-made content that's console-friendly and curated with safeguards".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-the-sims-4-family.jpg?itok=Mm5k7TEx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-the-sims-4-family.jpg?itok=3R2f-o6s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty is happening in the world of&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, just not&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>EA also says it's currently working on Project Rene, which, I suppose, officially isn't&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>, although EA stops just short of explaining what it actually is, simply saying that it is "focused on building ways for friends to meet, connect, and share while playing together in an all-new world".</p>
<p>We'll learn more about Creator Packs in November, and more details about Project Rene will likely emerge when an "invite-only playtest" is held this fall. Additionally,&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>will, of course, continue to receive regular updates.</p>
<p>Given that Paradox's&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled earlier this year</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>now has pretty scant competition, although games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">InZoi</a>&nbsp;</em>are still keeping a watchful eye on the franchise's life sim crown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>' new agenda manages to achieve, and whether any of its upcoming competitors manage to knock it off its throne. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

Previously, the duo <a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/news-and-features/writers-kate-herron-and-briony-redman-join-forces-for-doctor-who">wrote together for the new <em>Doctor Who </em>series</a>, and Herron directed the entirety of <em>Loki</em>’s first season for Disney Plus.</p><p>EA did not share any story details or tease when the movie might hit theaters, but the fact that the project is being coproduced by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/margot-robbie-and-luckychap-partners-talk-their-producing-strategy-if-its-not-a-f-yes-its-a-no-4105712/">Margot Robbie’s LuckyChap</a> suggests that it might have a certain <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799181/barbie-review-mattel-warner-bros-greta-gerwig"><em>Barbie </em>quality</a> to it when it ultimately releases. It’s easier to imagine <em>The Sims </em>lending itself to a compelling movie than, say, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126457/monopoly-movie-lionsgate-margot-robbie"><em>Monopoly</em></a> — another game-inspired feature LuckyChap is currently producing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For me it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-return-to-the-the-legend-of-zelda-the-ocarina-of-tim-1845132043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-return-to-the-the-legend-of-zelda-the-ocarina-of-tim-1845132043"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em></a></span>. Some of my earliest memories are of sitting in front of a small CRT TV set up in the living room watching my brother run through the fields of Hyrule. Before even getting the controller in my own hands, <em>Ocarina of Time </em>began what would become a life-long love of the medium.</p><p>That love of video games is proudly on display in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-the-plucky-squire-2d-3d-zelda-trailer-launch-1851623031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-the-plucky-squire-2d-3d-zelda-trailer-launch-1851623031"><em>The Plucky Squire</em></a></span>, an adorable platformer that blends 2D and 3D influences from throughout the medium’s history. Developer All Possible Futures pulls off a wonderful feat in this short homage to the games that helped define a generation, which works not only as a potent piece of nostalgia but also as a delightful experience in its own right. While a little rough around the edges in some places, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is a game so full of heart that it’ll remind you every step of the way why games are so special.</p><h2 id="h126317"><a id=""></a>Leaping off the page</h2><p>The developers at All Possible Futures are, like me and millions of other gamers, clearly fans of classic <em>Zelda</em> games. <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is, at its simplest, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-trailer-nintendo-switch-pc-playstatio-1849048046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-trailer-nintendo-switch-pc-playstatio-1849048046"><em>Zelda</em>-like</a></span> inspired by the golden age of the NES and SNES—think titles like the original 1986 <em>Zelda </em>or 1991’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-making-of-the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-5904884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-making-of-the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-5904884"><em>A Link to the Past</em></a></span>. In a top-down 2D perspective, you control Jot—the titular Squire full of pluck—as he fights bad guys and solves puzzles.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-recommend-id="image://ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire swings a sword at a goblin on a 2D map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plucky squire swings a sword at a goblin on a 2D map" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-recommend-id="image://ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire swings a sword at a goblin on a 2D map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The narrative wrinkle of <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is that Jot and all the other people you encounter are characters within a children’s story book titled, you guessed it, <em>The Plucky Squire</em>. To emphasize this the game turns the screen-to-screen transitions of early <em>Zelda </em>titles into a page turning in the book, revealing the next part of the map. It’s little flourishes like this that help emphasize the charm of <em>The Plucky Squire</em>. The game’s roughly ten-hour adventure begins when the evil Humgrump becomes aware of his literary prison and finds a way to kick Jot out of the book and begins a campaign to change the story for his own benefit. </p><p>Once Jot is jettisoned out of his story, you find yourself on the desk of a young kid named Sam who loves <em>The Plucky Squire</em>. The game then transitions from a 2D <em>Zelda</em>-like to a 3D platformer, taking inspiration from yet another era of gaming. Here you do more fighting, puzzling, and jumping in an attempt to return to Jot’s home, which you quickly accomplish. From this point forward, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> becomes a multi-dimensional puzzle that tasks you with jumping in and out of the storybook to complete the roadblocks Humgrump puts in your way.</p><figure id="" data-id="3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-recommend-id="image://3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire runs through a 3D world on a kid's desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plucky squire runs through a 3D world on a kid's desk" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-recommend-id="image://3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire runs through a 3D world on a kid's desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jot is able to do this with the aid of a growing list of tools that let him meddle with the metatextual nature of his adventure. This leads to some truly delightful levels, such as one that required me to freeze an object on the page and then close the book to transfer that object to the opposite page to then unlock a door. Combat does exist in the game, and it’s serviceable enough, but the multi-faceted puzzles are where <em>The Plucky Squire</em> shines.<br></p><h2 id="h126318"><a id=""></a><strong>A link to the past</strong></h2><p><em>The Plucky Squire</em> doesn’t just honor classic 2D and 3D games in its core gameplay—you’ll be faced with a number of minigames clearly cribbing from iconic games of the past throughout your adventure. An early boss fight turns into a boxing match straight out of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-punch-out-40th-anniversary-1851271511&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-punch-out-40th-anniversary-1851271511"><em>Punch-Out!!</em></a></span> complete with dodging, jabbing, and uppercuts. A more stealth-based section late in the game seems to pull from a much more recent title, requiring you to navigate a short dungeon while moving to the beat a la 2015’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-speedrunner-makes-near-impossi-1784329931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-speedrunner-makes-near-impossi-1784329931"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a></span>. I won’t spoil every send-up for you but know that the list is long, and each one is clearly made with love.</p><p>While each of these homages look incredible, rendered in adorable 2D illustrations or 3D models, they all feel a little off. I mean this quite literally, the controls of each minigame—and to some extent the game at large—are consistently somewhat unresponsive. I first noticed this in an early 2D platforming level that takes on the side-scrolling perspective of a <em>Mario </em>game, when prompting Jot to jump never behaved quite as expected. —I’d always fall a little short due to the unexpected sluggishness of his movement. A similar problem occurred in a rhythm-inspired minigame where the proper input window felt completely unsynced to the beat. These imperfections are made less frustrating thanks to a wonderful array of accessibility options that go as far as to let you skip a minigame that is giving you too much trouble. I do, however, wish that the controls themselves were a little tighter across the board.<br></p><p>It’s almost surprising to see so much gaming history in <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s DNA considering how angled towards kids the game feels. It’s perfect for a parent to give to their child in the hopes of fostering a love for games in the next generation, even if that generation may have little to no knowledge of <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s references. A kid is still likely to have a good time thanks to how delightful the puzzle-solving is, while a parent watching over their shoulder can smile knowingly at every homage. The story itself is simple, sweet, and easy to understand. This does mean that the more adult gamer might get a bit bored at times, but there are some jokes and clever tidbits throughout to help keep you interested. Though within all of that is a message about the importance of art at a young age and the power it has to inspire. <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is for kids, and that’s its greatest strength.</p><h2 id="h126319"><a id=""></a><strong>Forward thinking</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-recommend-id="image://9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire ziplines across a string of flags" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plucky squire ziplines across a string of flags" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-recommend-id="image://9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire ziplines across a string of flags" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The result of classic games successfully enrapturing an entire generation led to something wonderful: more video games. There would not be a modern gaming industry without the kids who fell in love with <em>Zelda </em>on the Famicom in 1986. They would become lifelong players, critics, and developers. They would be the ones who made the games that the next generation would fall in love with, who in turn would become inspired to make even more games.<br></p><p><em>The Plucky Squire</em> is all about that lineage of art, inspiration, and creation. The most important role Jot fills as the hero of his book isn’t that of Humgrump’s vanquisher, rather it is his ability to inspire the kid whose desk his book sits on to create something of their own. Every person has a story about what game made them fall in love with the medium, and there is a chance that <em>The Plucky Squire</em> becomes that for some kid that plays it—the thing that will push them to create. How can you not be romantic about video games?</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="tw-target-text"><p>Art Scrolls are one of The Plucky Squire’s collectibles. In addition to them, we need to find all the Glitchbirds to obtain the game’s platinum trophy. Collecting all 50 Scrolls unlocks the Art Collector gold trophy.</p><p>Scrolls can be found in three locations: inside the book, in the outside world and purchased from an NPC. The progress of this collectible is saved in the chapter selection and they are listed in ascending order in the Art Gallery.</p></div>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glitchbirds-locations-plucky-squire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where to Find All the Glitchbirds in The Plucky Squire</a></h6>







<p>Before we start, it’s important to mention that this trophy is missable. After completing the game, the NPC that sells some of the scrolls won’t appear when you replay the chapters, so you will need to replay the game again.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll 1 – Chapter 1</strong></p>



<p>Right after you find Violeta, you will need to go to the tower. You will find this scroll in the first scenario you enter after talking to Moonbeard.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 2 – Chapter 1 </strong></p>



<p>Bought from the NPC for 20 “coins” after you open the game using the words.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll 3 – Chapter 2</strong></p>



<p>He’s in the trees a little above the first bull you encounter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 4 – Chapter 2</strong></p>



<p>Bought from the NPC for 20 “coins” in the second time you encounter her.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll 5 – Chapter 2</strong></p>



<p>Hit the tree in the lower left corner when entering the scene where everything is dark. There is a message in the middle of the scene. You arrive in this scenario shortly after meeting the NPC for the second time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 6 – Chapter 2</strong></p>



<p>Bought from the NPC for 20 “coins” in the third time you encounter her.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll 7 – Chapter 2</strong></p>



<p>This scroll is in the lower left corner of the scene where we find several stacked books. The path is blocked. To clear the path, we need to get the golden key on the left side and take it to the right side. A room will open with a phrase. Hit the word Spread and replace it with the word Stacked which is in the middle of the level.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 8 – Chapter 3</strong></p>



<p>Right at the beginning of the chapter, you will have to complete a tutorial on how to turn the pages of the book with the mage. When you turn the page, it will tell you to enter the portal. This scroll is in the upper right corner.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 9 – Chapter 3</strong></p>



<p>When the little mage teaches you how to leave the book, leave, go north and climb the platforms.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 10 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>Bought from the NPC for 20 “coins” in the fourth time you encounter her.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll 11 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>You need to hit a tree in the left corner of the page where the frogs are singing. You will need to change the word Night to Day.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 12 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>Inside a dark phase after you get past the scene with the frogs singing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 13 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>During chapter 4, you will be required to search the outside world for a long-range weapon. At some point, you will have to move a large block. The scroll is in the exact location where the block was.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 14 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>During chapter 4, you will be required to search the outside world for a long-range weapon. At one point, you’ll knock down a door after obtaining a golden key. This scroll is on the right side hidden before you go up to the main path.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 15 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>Bought from the NPC for 20 “coins” in the fifth time you encounter her.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll 16 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>Hit a tree right after the Bug boss kidnaps the protagonist friends.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Scroll 17 – Chapter 4</strong></p>



<p>This scroll is given as a reward after rescuing all the piggies. Keep in mind that to rescue the last two, you will need to access a portal in the outside world.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll 18 – Chapter 5</strong></p>

<p>Developer Full Circle has announced that Skate will finally launch in Early Access in 2025. The announcement comes as the game gets set for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-trailer-debut-summer-games-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console playtests this fall</a>.</p>



<p>“We’re incredibly stoked to announce that skate. will be launching in Early Access in 2025,” the developers said <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via social media</a>. “We’ll share more details on what to expect in the coming months.”</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-skate">What Is Skate?</h2>



<p>Skate is the reboot of the classic franchise, but with a focus on multiplayer gameplay. The game will be a free-to-play live service game that will feature regular updates weekly, monthly, etc.</p>



<p>“We’re excited to be working on a ton of social features to help you team-up, cooperate, or compete with other players in the city,” Lead social designer Andreia Goncalves said back in June on the multiplayer aspect of the game. “You can play challenges together or make your own fun by combining our quick drop objects and Throwdown modes…”</p>



<p>Before the Early Access announcement, it was revealed that Skate was having its “Flick-It” trick control system rebuilt in order to make  gameplay more “fun and satisfying” for players.</p>



<p>“We want to make sure every trick feels fun and satisfying, while delivering the familiarity from past Skate games,” Full Circle said at the time. “On top of that, we’ve improved accuracy and control to make learning tricks easier.”</p>
