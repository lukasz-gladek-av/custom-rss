Both GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a> and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wider critical space</a> have plenty of praise to heap on the game. If you're diving in soon, you'll want to know how long it takes to beat Donkey Kong Bananza. We have that information, along with the game's chapter list, right here for you.</p><h2>How long is Donkey Kong Bananza?</h2><p>DK's latest banana-fuelled quest will differ greatly in length depending on how committed you are to finding all of its collectibles, completing optional challenges, and exploring the many sublayers of its mining-focused world. For a typical player--someone who beats the game through to the final boss and does <em>some</em> optional objectives, you're looking at <strong>a playthrough of 15-20 hours</strong>. However, there's more than one way to play, too.</p><p>For someone seeking out every last banana, Banandium Gem, challenge course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-transformations-in-donkey-kong-bananza-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6727/" data-ref-id="2900-6727">transformations</a>, and all Style Shop costumes for both DK and Paulina, <strong>a full 100% playthrough will run you closer to 50-60 hours</strong>. Careful, as there is such a thing as too much potassium.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4533841-c111819ae2b07f446ab92d64c8d37e9ef8e541e30b687121fa6d5976096b61f9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533841" data-ratio="0.56242424242424" data-width="1650" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4533841-c111819ae2b07f446ab92d64c8d37e9ef8e541e30b687121fa6d5976096b61f9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533841"></a><figcaption>Alongside Paulina, DK is once more in search of many, many bananas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4533841-c111819ae2b07f446ab92d64c8d37e9ef8e541e30b687121fa6d5976096b61f9.jpg"></figure><h2>Donkey Kong Bananza chapter list</h2><p>The full run of levels and their encompassing missions is below. Note, however, that levels also have sublevels--and we mean that geographically, as you can often find yourself mining up or down through a level. These sublevels will house more optional objectives, and sometimes even main objectives, so you'll often find yourself in them naturally.</p><p>Beside each level, we've listed the total number of bananas found in it, totaling a whopping<strong> 777 across the whole game</strong>. You won't be able to nab all of these until the end of the game and into the post-game, as a lot is purposely blocked off until then. All 17 chapters in Donkey Kong Bananza are listed below in the order you'll encounter them.</p><ol><li>Ingot Isle Cave-in - SL1 - 36 bananas</li><li>Lagoon Layer - SL100 - 56 bananas</li><li>Hilltop Layer - SL200 - 38 bananas</li><li>Canyon Layer - SL300 - 80 bananas</li><li>The Divide - SL400 - 10 bananas</li><li>Freezer Layer - SL500 - 87 bananas</li><li>Forest Layer - SL600 - 83 bananas</li><li>The Junction - SL700 - 15 bananas</li><li>Resort Layer - SL800 - 42 bananas</li><li>Tempest Layer - SL900 - 70 bananas</li><li>Landfill Layer - SL1000 - 27 bananas</li><li>Racing Layer - SL1100 - 10 bananas</li><li>Radiance Layer - SL1200 - 76 bananas</li><li>Groove Layer - SL1300 - 30 bananas</li><li>Feast Layer - SL1400 - 69 bananas</li><li>Forbidden Layer - SL1500 - 25 bananas</li><li>Planet Core - SL1600 - 23 bananas</li></ol>

Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-trailer-sees-johnny-cage-jumping-over-a-bazooka-missile-with-some-very-wide-legs">yesterday's cheeky teaser trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie's ready for its full reveal, with two-and-a-half minutes of silliness, a little bit of splatter, and plenty of Johnny Cage.
</p>
<p>
A follow-up to 2021's mildly diverting live-action Mortal Kombat movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-movie-sequel-on-the-way-with-a-script-from-the-writer-of-moon-knight">announced all the way back in January 2021</a>, with Jeremy Slater - head writer on Disney+'s Moon Knight series - confirmed to be handling the script. Simon McQuoid remains on directing duties after helming the first movie, and the intervening years have brought various bits of casting news.
</p>
<p>
Top of the list, of course, is The Boys star Karl Urban, who's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-movie-reveals-best-look-yet-at-karl-urbans-johnny-cage">stepping into the high-kicking boots of series icon Johnny Cage</a>. This time around, it's Cage who's sucked through a portal and into the world of Mortal Kombat (Lewis Tan's Cole Young, who had a similar experience in the first movie is back too), and there's plenty of Cage in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tLZOvvf-n8">today's Mortal Kombat 2 reveal trailer</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's utterly daft stuff, leaning firmly into the pulpy ridiculousness of it all, even if the included Fatalities - which were rather underrepresented in the movie - aren't perhaps as outlandish as you might hope for. Still, who can resist a classic bit of surprise bifurcation, eh?
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat 2 also stars the likes of Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Adeline Rudolph as Kitana, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Mehcad Brooks as Jackson "Jax" Briggs, CJ Bloomfield as Baraka, Tati Gabrielle as Jade, Chin Han as Shang Tsung, Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion, and Max Huang as Kung Lao. And if all that appeals, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">out in cinemas on 24th October</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film, saying, "There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent [it] from being a complete disaster" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">his review</a>. So fingers crossed for the sequel.

<p>USB-C what we did there?</p>

It's hot. It's 'close', as they say round here. And when you're already hot and bothered, sometimes turning on your Switch 2 console in portable mode for a quick session, well, it's not gonna make you any cooler, let's put it like that.</p>
<p>And so, we've been delighted to see one gamer over on Reddit coming up with a very silly tip for hot days spent playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, or whatever else it is you've got on the go (this writer is all over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> right now, FWIW).</p>
<p>Yes, as posted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1lxi84m/found_another_use_for_the_top_usbc_port/">u/Gamingjojo909</a> — who we're assuming is some sort of colossal genius — the top USB-C slot on the Switch 2 console can seemingly power a mini fan while you play (just probably not very safely). Huzzah!</p>

<p>Of course, as fun as this looks — and we're sure it's quite effective for beating the heat momentarily — it will also likely toast your battery pretty quickly and could, as noted a little further down in the comments, maybe even fry your Switch because of...science.</p>
<p>So don't do it. Just look at someone else doing it instead.</p>

<p>Right. Well, we're off to try plugging our favourite toothbrush into our consoles now. How dangerous could it be, right?</p>

However, I’ve spotted these games appearing in different parts of the store while looking for other stuff. And I can only imagine how many younger kids are searching up some of those “Italian Brainrot” memes and buying games based on them. Many of these titles featuring AI art are priced very low. <em>Tralalero Tralala Jumper,</em> for example, is only 50 cents. </p><p>I’m honestly baffled as to why Sony is letting this stuff live on the PlayStation Store next to big games like <em>God of War</em> and indie darlings like <em>Blue Prince.</em> It makes the store feel less like a curated collection of great games and more like a landfill where anyone can dump their garbage. It took me just a few minutes to locate dozens of these games, and it seems wild to me that Sony doesn’t have a few people on staff going through and deleting some of the most egregious crap on the store. </p><p>If something isn’t done soon I wouldn’t be surprised if this AI slop becomes a bigger problem, with more and more folks stumbling upon this junk as they shop the PlayStation Store. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/can-skate-revive-the-old-school-magic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-skate-revive-the-old-school-magic.1246467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Skate’s announcement way back in 2020 (originally dubbed Skate 4) we’ve seen an influx of skateboarding games, from sims like Session, to the arcadey Tony Hawk remakes, and unique experiences like VR Skater and Olli Olli World. No matter how you look at it, skateboarding video games are definitely back, but they’re still missing that open-world sandbox feel that the Skate series popularized back in the late 2000’s. When I got the chance to play an alpha build of Skate 3’s long awaited sequel, I was excited but also skeptical of how the Skate revival would work as a live service game, and most importantly, would it be able to recapture the magic from the first three entries?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within minutes of my nearly six hours with Skate and after a few moments of me spectacularly ragdolling around San Vansterdam, I was able to reactivate my long dormant muscle memory to find myself grinding and kick flipping my way around Skate’s sandbox world. From the extremely intuitive and easy-to-digest first handful of missions that smartly taught me its gameplay mechanics in small digestible chunks, to its cleverly designed world that never slowed me down when I was cursing around, and its unique traversal system that plays more like an Assassin’s Creed and Spider-Man game than what I would expect from a skateboarding sim, it’s obvious that developer Full Circle took an “if it ain't broke, don't fix it” approach to this and made sure that Skate is a game that can be played and understood quickly. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Skate 4 Pre-Pre-Alpha Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the classic control scheme, Skate offers two variations of controls that can make the difficulty curve easier for new players as well as a multitude of quality-of-life features that, quite frankly, are a welcome addition. While I stuck with the original control scheme and didn't mess with any of Skate's accessibility features outside of a few less button presses, there's definitely a way to make Skate’s unique playstyle a little easier for both series newcomers and die-hard Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater fans. Regardless of how you want to play, Skate’s controls make pulling off gravity-defying tricks an easy and really fun process, thanks to its flick controls and intuitive movement system.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Skate’s controls make pulling off gravity-defying tricks an easy and really fun process.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, I had a ton of fun with my time cruising around San Vansterdam discovering cool things to skate on while riding from objective to objective. At its core, Skate is a big open sandbox where you jump on and off of things and do cool tricks in-between that. Because of this, I never felt pressured to complete any nearby objectives on my map, I never paid much attention to my score, nor did I feel stuck in that carrot-on-a-stick gameplay loop so many live service games rely on. While you are encouraged to complete objectives in order to unlock new areas and level up your character, I found myself ignoring that and just vibing around to the in-game soundtrack and finding new cool places to skate on. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, discovering those spots is extremely simple thanks to the ability to hop off your board and parkour around the map. I was able to easily scale buildings with Skate’s easy-to-use climbing controls and drop markers wherever I needed to spawn back to, which happened whenever I tried something stupid – like attempting to heelflip off a skyscraper onto a park bench. Which never worked out, by the way, but I still found myself trying over and over again. A movement system like this makes Skate less frustrating to mess around with and find fun and ridiculous areas to skate on all over the map. That being said, there are a hefty amount of objectives and story quests to complete that range from following a premade line, to getting a high score, and even one where I had to skydive off a building into a nearby bridge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonally, Skate looks and feels a bit different than the direction the original trilogy had. While I'm definitely nostalgic for the pseudo-realistic look of the originals, the world in Skate seems to be a bit more exaggerated and saturated. Early on in my session I had to complete a mission where I jumped off a building into a dumpster. The in-game narrator explained that nobody in that world feels pain when falling because a tech start up called ImpervaTEK figured out how to make people invincible. When asked to further elaborate, I was told to not worry because its science and the topic was never mentioned again. That’s pretty dumb, but OK, whatever. Let’s me keep skating, I guess. And while I loved the simple world building of Skate, the character models took a bit of time to get used to, since they kind of look like next generation Sims. But eventually, after a few costume adjustments, I was happy with how my bleach-blonde, mullet-wearing self looked, and I was back to landing triple kick-flips in no time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you weren’t already aware, Skate is a free-to-play live service game, and while that is a major departure from the previous titles, its heavy focus on multiplayer gameplay really makes this version of Skate seem like it could be a game I would return to long after its release. The developers on site told me that there could be well over 100+ players on the map at once, and while proximity chat was not featured in my demo, I never really felt like I needed to speak out loud to anyone whenever I ran into another skater. Seeing other people casually mess around in Skate’s sandbox world is a unique experience that very few live service games seem to get right, and with its numerous customization features and evolving world, I’m pretty optimistic about the world feeling alive once it's released and I can absolutely see a map full of people hanging out and skating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there is a level progression system where you can earn in-game cosmetics, one of which is that same pair of Vans a lot of us have been wearing for the past twenty-something years, notable decks from major skate brands, emotes, and a ton of cool and weird clothes to put on my custom character. As expected, there is also an in-game store full of cosmetic items and costumes, but I never felt like I needed to buy anything and was reassured that there are no “pay to win” microtransactions in Skate. While this is only from pre-alpha gameplay and that can all change, I didn't seem to find any of the typical trappings from other free-to-play live service offerings. Let’s hope it stays that way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing Skate for well over five hours, not only I can clearly see the direction developer Full Circle is taking the series, but I can also say that Skate is shaping up to be a game worthy of being the long-awaited sequel to 2010’s Skate 3. The gameplay seems refined and lives up to its predecessors, the world is big and fun to explore, and the overall sandbox’s “do what you want” vibe is really making me look forward to diving back into Skate – and hopefully add it to my rotation of games that I can pick up and relax to after a long day. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/can-skate-revive-the-old-school-magic]]></content:encoded>

Call of Duty's in-game shop will feature bundles for the characters Stan Smith and Roger.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-hHTlLr-4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9B-hHTlLr-4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Stan Smith bundle goes live sometime later today, and Roger's bundle is scheduled to hit the shop July 20. Stan's bundle includes one operator skin and various cosmetics, while Roger's bundle is packed with three different skins for the character as well as additional items. Both bundles also feature operator voice lines, as previewed in the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Prices aren't mentioned in this new announcement, but these operator packs will likely feature a price of 2,800 CoD Points ($25) for each bundle, which is the typical cost for most bundles in Call of Duty's big IP crossovers.</p><p dir="ltr">This American Dad crossover continues the cartoon theme of Season 4 Reloaded, which previously added cel-shaded maps and Beavis and Butt-Head as Call of Duty operators. It's also not too late to unlock this animated duo. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head event</a> is live until July 30, and there are free and premium rewards available to unlock. This includes free skins for Todd and Coach Buzzcut, and paid skins for both Beavis and Butt-Head.</p>

Beyond that, it's fully compatible with the new hardware. Officially licensed by Nintendo, it offers up to 40 hours of play on a single charge, support for motion controls, two remappable back buttons, and an ergonomic design that should keep you comfortable during extended play sessions.</p><p>Overall, the Rematch is a good controller with well-rounded features and a solid build. There are better controllers for the price, but the main draw here is the striking artwork.</p><p>Covered in hues of green and black with red accents, it features DK and Diddy Kong racing through the jungle. The back buttons are red while the triggers are green, which should make it stand out in your game room. Its lenticular design means that, as you move the controller, the design will slowly morph, revealing new layers of detail. This is a fairly uncommon design feature--and one that makes it a bit more exciting than your standard gamepad.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533680" data-ratio="0.40983606557377" data-width="1464" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533680"></a><figcaption>Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Pro Controller: Donkey Kong Reveal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg"></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Rematch is already available in a handful of Super Mario-themed designs.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-it-and-avoid-paying-the-250-million-bonus-to-unknown-worlds.1246431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The battle between KRAFTON and Subnautica 2 developers Unknown Worlds, has escalated even further, as the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds' co-founders, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill is now unsealed, revealing the full details regarding why the co-founders are suing KRAFTON for a breach of contract.</p>



<p>If you want to get a recap on what's happened so far, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">check out a bullet point list here</a> that goes through all the events in this saga so far. Today's story comes from the fact that the lawsuit the co-founders filed is <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">now available to read in full</a>, if you're so inclined. </p>



<p>Some key context, if you've not been following this story, is that when Unknown Worlds was acquired by KRAFTON in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">2021</a>, it did so for $500 million, with an additional $250 million to be paid out as a bonus to the studio if it hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. On paper, the three co-founders and 40 employees at Unknown Worlds were due to receive a portion of that bonus, with the co-founders receiving the bulk of it. The co-founders also stipulate that they would have spread the wealth even further to the other members of the team who were not due to receive the bonus on paper.</p>



<p>According to the co-founders, Unknown Worlds' relationship with KRAFTON only started to deteriorate when KRAFTON realized that Subnautica 2 launching in early access by the end of this year would have meant the studio hitting and surpassing the revenue targets required to unlock the $250 million bonus. </p>



<p>The suit even adds that KRAFTON's chief executive officer, Changhan Kim, admitted to the Unknown Worlds co-founders that if Subnautica 2 was released in early access in 2025, and Unknown Worlds hit its revenue targets to unlock the $250 million bonus, "<em>it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for KRAFTON</em>." The company now denies that Kim made such an admission, and blames it on translators misinterpreting Kim's words, despite that never being an issue previously.</p>



<p>"<em>So KRAFTON engaged in a months-long campaign to delay Subnautica 2's release,</em>" the suit reads. "<em>It pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important pre-launch tasks. Multiple KRAFTON employees themselves suggested that these moves were for the purposes of frustrating the earnout, despite the earnout agreement's prohibition on taking actions for that purpose</em>."</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds would not be swayed by these sabotage measures, and members of the studio took it upon themselves to do the things its publisher, KRAFTON, should have been doing. It's at this point where we catch up to the events that began on July 2, with the three co-founders being fired. </p>



<p>"<em>In flagrant disregard of the parties' contract, KRAFTON terminated without cause three former owners of Unknown Worlds - Charles Cleveland, Adam "Max" McGuire, and Edward "Ted" Gill (the "Founders") - and seized control of the company. KRAFTON's first decision upon taking over? To delay the launch of Subnautica 2 until sometime in 2026. That way, KRAFTON could keep the game's revenue for itself, while avoiding the $250 million earnout it would likely have owed the Founders and other Unknown Worlds employees.</em>"</p>



<p>The lawsuit also attacks claims made by KRAFTON, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">previously claimed</a> that Cleveland and the other co-founders had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at Unknown Worlds in order to work on a "<em>personal film project</em>." According to the suit, the co-founders were working on a film. A Subnautica movie, that KRAFTON had asked the co-founders to work on.</p>



<p>It further attacks claims made by KRAFTON that Subnautica 2 was not ready for early access launch. In the milestone review documents that were leaked and subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed to be real by KRAFTON</a>, the publisher claims that Subnautica 2 was lacking content, and that based on player feedback from internal playtests, it had to be delayed into 2026. </p>



<p>According to the co-founders' lawsuit, the 'experts' KRAFTON hired to deem Subnautica 2 as unfit weren't experts at all and had no experience developing and releasing early access titles. The co-founders also flat-out disagreed with the assessment of player feedback from the internal playtests, saying that the feedback in fact "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" that Subnautica 2 was ready to launch.</p>



<p>The lawsuit also alleges that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">statement made on the Unknown Worlds website</a> confirming the delay of Subnautica 2 was written by KRAFTON, after the publisher took control of the site and published without the knowledge of anyone at Unknown Worlds.</p>



<p>"<em>In short, KRAFTON flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without cause. Promise broken</em>...<em>In the name of its bottom line, KRAFTON has thrown its promises out the window and ripped the game from the hands of both its creators and its community</em>."</p>



<p>KRAFTON now has the task of trying to argue against these claims. We'll continue to update you on this story as more details become public and as KRAFTON tries to fire back.</p>

            <p>
The grey, uncomfortably moist British summer is finally here and Epic is celebrating the occasion - well, the season - with the launch of its Epic Store Summer Sale. But there's more, seeing as Thursday also marks a fresh batch of new freebies, which this week includes Civilisation 6.
</p>
<p>
Starting with those freebies, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">Civilisation 6 is available in its Platinum Edition</a>, meaning you get the base game, six DLC packs, and two expansions for your initial outlay of zero pence. That's good! Civilisation 6 is good (shut up haters)! So you should download it now.
</p>
<p>
Civ 6 will continue to be free until next Thursday, 24th July, after which Legion TD 2 - an "infinitely replayable multiplayer and single-player tower defense" game - takes its place.
</p>
<p>
So that's the free stuff out the way, which brings us to Epic's Summer Sale, which runs from today, 17th July, until 31st July. Working slightly backward, all purchases made during the sale (and using Epic's payment system) will earn you Epic Reward points as usual, but the percentage has been boosted to 20 percent. There's also a permanent 20 percent back for all purchases made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>.
</p>
<p>
So what of this sale? Epic's calling it "two weeks of discounts on best-selling games, from the biggest titles to some excellent indie games." And there's some good stuff here. There's 10 percent off developer Sandfall Interactive's highly acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/expedition-33-b3240d"></a>, for instance, plus 25 percent off <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, 50 percent off <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-remastered">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</a>, or 20 percent off if you <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-2">opt for its sequel</a>. There's plenty more of course, and you'll find it all as you <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US">peruse moistly around the Epic Games Store</a>.

			<p>While it wasn’t to everyone’s tastes, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> was a real breakthrough hit for developers Teyon. Having followed the dev team since the wonderfully awful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/13/rambo-the-video-game-review/">Rambo</a> game, and rather enjoying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/21/terminator-resistance-review/">Terminator: Resistance</a>, it’s great to see their progress being rewarded. While I enjoyed Rogue City a lot <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/31/robocop-rogue-city-review/">more than my erstwhile colleague</a>, there were clear issues with pacing in that title as the beat cop aspects felt a little over represented. Unfinished Business feels like a direct response to that criticism as it is a far more focused and better paced adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsZxnR-EM6c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The retro stylings of RoboCop are clear to see, the shiny graphics engine notwithstanding. Old school tech, clunky electronics, green screen monitors and VCRs litter the environment. This retro feel is further compounded by Unfinished Business being a good old-fashioned standalone expansion rather than a DLC. This means that not only is it a complete narrative in its own right, but that you don’t need to own or even have played the original. It does follows on from the first game – which was itself set between RoboCop 2 and 3 – but also adds new origin lore so that, aside from some dialogue references, you wouldn’t miss out on anything by playing this first.</p>


<p>I played through Unfinished Business on PS5, having enjoyed the original on PC and although I always prefer mouse and keyboard for first-person titles, the tank-like nature of RoboCop means that it handles equally as well on controller. Teyon have really captured the feel of being a massive chunk of metal with the absence of any jump or crouch distinguishing gameplay from other FPS games. There are sections where you control other characters in Unfinished Business, such as with flashbacks to a pre-robo Alex Murphy, giving the opportunity to have traditional controls that contrast brilliantly with our main unstoppable cyborg hero.</p>


<p>The opening level of Unfinished Business is a traumatic one. The Precinct has been attacked and you investigate the carnage to discover that your OCP interface equipment has been stolen. Once you track the mercenaries responsible to the Omnitower – an OCP skyscraper that sits outside the jurisdiction of the police force – you set out to seek justice (and a bit of light revenge). The focused nature of the location here helps to avoid the somewhat frustrating meandering of the first game. There are still side quests and investigations to carry out, but they feel much more rooted to the central narrative than they did in Rogue City.</p>
<p>Once you find your way into the OmniTower, you are soon greeted over your communications by a mysterious ally who offers guidance and can hack some locked doors for you – their identity is key to the surprisingly effective story that adds a lot to the general lore of RoboCop. This is also expanded by the reveal of the main villain, a face from Murphy’s past with a twisted motivation of their own. Voice acting is solid throughout, and while some of the facial animations are a little uncanny valley this wasn’t enough to distract from the delivery.</p>

<p>The real meat of the game comes from the visceral combat and RoboCop has a wealth of weapons to wield. The default Auto-9 pistol returns and can be upgraded using different circuit boards as you progress. Some of the best boards are rewards for completing side quests and the parts you use to upgrade are hidden in OCP chests scattered throughout the tower. I found a high-powered board that gave me automatic fire and no need to reload, fulfilling the RoboCop power fantasy to a tee, even if it did make some of the later encounters a little too easy.</p>
<p>Alongside your trusty pistol there are many different weapons to pick up and use, and you can carry one extra alongside the Auto-9. These range from a simple pistol to assault rifles, a gatling gun and even some high-tech story related weapons so there’s never a shortage of firearms to mix up the combat. You can also pick up and throw environmental objects, as well as trigger special environmental takedowns when near particular parts of the scenery.</p>

<p>The focused nature of the location is accompanied by a plot that drives you through the game’s 8-10 hour play time. As mentioned above, the side quests are far more integrated into the main story and there isn’t the same kind of tedious downtime that plagued the first game (although I quite enjoyed the banal side of ticketing wrongly parked cars). Most of the characters you interact with have some function to aid your progression and there are some suitably funny interactions at times.</p>
<p>A minor complaint is that I did have a couple of small progress bugs where actions didn’t trigger in my review build, but these were very rare and always sorted themselves out after a quick reload.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Unfinished Business is a great evolution of Teyon’s take on RoboCop, with the more focused narrative and progression helping the story to push you through some combat encounters, whilst also adding some excellent lore to the wider world of Alex Murphy. If you enjoyed the first game, and maybe even if you didn’t, then I can recommend this return to Detroit. You have more than ten seconds to comply, but resistance is futile.	</p></div>

<p>"This ain't no f@#%ing kid's game"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Woah, woah, woah! Steady on, chaps. It seems as though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/edge_of_allegoria">The Edge of Allegoria</a>, a turn-based RPG that harkens back to the graphical style and gameplay of Game Boy gems of yore, might not be the kid-friendly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> tribute it seems at first glance.</p>
<p>Arriving on 7th August on Switch 1, Button Factory Games' ode to the old-school RPGs on Nintendo's classic handheld strikes an adults-only tone in an effort to stand out and, judging by the trailer, it certainly looks like you might need to cover any nearby children's eyes and/or ears, unless you want them to hear mild drug references, swear words, and mentions of various horse parts. Oh my goodness!</p>
<p>There have already been some reviews of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1870700/The_Edge_of_Allegoria/">the Steam version</a> of this one, where it's been available since December last year, and honestly it sounds like foul-mouthed Pokémon with some reasonably decent battling to us. A win-win scenario.</p>
<p>Whether or not the crude humour is gonna work may be more a matter of personal taste/a sticking point, though, so make sure to scope out the trailer at the top of this very article. It's sat on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1870700/The_Edge_of_Allegoria/">a "Very Positive" user rating</a> (from 139 reviews) over on Valve's platform, so it may well be worth making a little note of, especially if sweary characters and sexy pixel butts are your cup of tea.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some press release deets and a few screens!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Harvest the body parts of your adversaries for financial gain and personal satisfaction, level up to strike down even greater foes, and arm yourself with more weapons and equipment than any sane person could be reasonably expected to carry on their person at any given time.</p>
<p>There are more than 144 unique enemies to face on your adventures through Allegoria, from ferocious Canadian geese and majestic tortoises to your bog-standard fantasy staples like dragons, unicorns, and the ever-ubiquitous slimes! There are plenty of beasts and beyond to encounter, each with unique item drops that can be sold in shops for the gold you'll need to purchase weapons and equipment to aid you on your journey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Edge of Allegoria launches on Nintendo Switch on 7th August and is priced at <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-edge-of-allegoria-switch/">$24.99 over on the US eShop.</a></p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It has been five years since Netflix first announced that it was working with Ubisoft to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536079/netflix-assassins-creed-live-action-series">develop a live-action <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>show</a> inspired by the hit games series. For a long time, it seemed like the project might be dead in the water given how little news there was about it. But now it looks like the streamer is ready to lock in and get down to business.</p><p>Netflix announced today that it has officially greenlit a new <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series that will be showrun and executive produced by Roberto Patino (<em>Westworld</em>, <em>Sons of Anarchy</em>) and David Wiener (<em>Halo</em>, <em>Brave New World</em>.) Along with Wiener and Patino, Ubisoft’s Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill, and Matt O’Toole are attached to executive produce.</p><p>Per Netflix, the new series will focus on “the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will.” The show will tell stories about multiple characters living through and influencing pivotal moments in human history. That doesn’t exactly say much about what the series will look and feel like, but it does sound like pretty standard <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fare.</p><p>In a statement about the show, Wiener and Patino said that they’re both excited about and humbled by all the possibilities the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>IP holds. They also expressed their desire to use the series to tell a story about what humanity loses as a species as our emotional connections break.</p><p>“Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story — about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith,” the duo said. “It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time.”</p><p>Netflix has had a fair amount of success with its animated video game adaptations like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24345341/castlevania-noctune-season-2-review-netflix"><em>Castlevania </em>series</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix"><em>Arcane</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/8/23159839/cyberpunk-edgerunners-anime-netflix-trailer-release-date"><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em></a>. But the streamer has had a much more inconsistent track record on the live-action side of things between its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134057/netflix-the-witcher-season-5-end">soon-to-be finished <em>Witcher </em>series</a> and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23186343/netflix-resident-evil-series-review">short-lived <em>Resident Evil </em>riff</a>. A five year gap between a project being announced and its subsequent greenlight isn’t <em>necessarily </em>a bad thing, and Wiener and Patino could absolutely be cooking up something fantastic. But we’re going to need to see and hear a bit more about what this <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>is going to be before people can get excited.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/netflix/708989/netflix-assassins-creed-roberto-patino]]></content:encoded>

"We are providing separation packages, career transition assistance, and opportunities for redeployment across our global network where possible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-review-prime-video-tim-miller"><u>Secret Level</u></a>, that Amazon Prime mini-series of short films inspired by popular video games? You know the episode that recast Pac-Man as a marooned warrior abducting strangers to help it fight its way out of a prison planet? Well, Bandai Namco fleshed that idea out into a lengthy metroidvania called Shadow Labyrinth – a rare Street Fighter: The Movie-type beat – and this bizarre reimagining of the industry’s oldest eater has been a truly challenging experience for me so far. Not necessarily because it’s difficult, as it’s not a cake walk but I’ve thrown myself against the rocks of more tortuous games in the past. No, my biggest struggle after 10 hours with it has been with staying interested in Shadow Labyrinth’s cryptic, slow, and frankly boring story while also fighting through some brutal checkpointing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not completely against the idea of a gritty reboot of Pac-Man in theory, but the execution here has not made a great case for it in practice at this point. The story, which drapes you in the rags of Puck’s (read: Pac-Man’s) sword swinging goon, sort of exists around you. It makes some sense given you’ve woken up without any memories or understanding of the wreckage of war that you’re being lead through by your scheming yellow companion, but Shadow Labyrinth’s insistence on making you stand around and watch broken, vague, trope-bloated dialogue between the handful of active characters is arduous. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The 10-minute Secret Level episode does a much more effective job of weaving an interesting parable by using the “cycle of survival” story as a parallel of the cyclical nature of Pac-Man’s eat-die-repeat gameplay. As a direct sequel to that short, Shadow Labyrinth expands on the story exponentially, but seems to fill that new space with dense, rote sci-fi lore that has so far had very few compelling plot happenings sprinkled throughout. I will hedge all of this by saying that, at the time right before writing this, the journey of Puck and the Swordsman took a pretty major turn that <em>could </em>unlock a lot more potential for a real compelling tale to be told – but based on what I’ve seen up to this point, I’m not going to hold my breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadow Labyrinth looks pretty good, though. The sort of moving paper doll animation used so well in games like Salt and Sanctuary is mostly solid here, too. There’s a surprising level of detail in many of the monsters I’ve encountered, especially the mechanical ones with all of their bits and doodads. Animations can feel a little stilted and floaty, like a marionette on strings, but it doesn’t affect the action in any meaningful way. The levels themselves make good use of color in their fore and backgrounds, but I wouldn’t call its renditions of the depths of a lava filled cavern or the many stories of a high tech tower all that unique. I haven’t found a zone that really has that kind of evocative wow factor, yet.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It expands on its Prime Video prequel episode with dense sci-fi lore.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual task of moving through these expansive areas has become progressively more engaging. Platforming has yet to be much of a challenge, with some side paths occasionally leading to more dangerous mini-puzzles and obstacles that’ll test your timing and reflexes. I was regularly presented with rails that morph you into the round yellow chomp machine we all recognize. These tracks allow you to waka waka waka up designated walls, around corners, and across ceilings, munching on pellets (which is a currency to spend on perks and upgrades) as you go. Hopping from line to line or launching Puck at foes with a spinning sword attack is funny at first, but I haven’t really encountered a section of this that feels truly clever outside of the fact that the gimmick exists in the first place. These are such isolated experiences at this point that if you removed all of these sections from Shadow Labyrinth, I wouldn’t miss any of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While on foot, obscure signposting and an abundance of crossroads often makes it unclear where the critical path lies and has had me regularly stumbling into side paths by accident, which sometimes leads to goodies like bonus health, and other times leads to a roadblock that I don’t yet have the upgrade to surmount. Sauntering around these corners has also felt oppressively dangerous as death will jettison me back to a checkpoint that almost always feels miles away from where I fell. It’s made more stressful because the checkpointing system is actually two-tiered: there are larger Miku Sol points that you can upgrade your warrior with and teleport between, and smaller pylons that are checkpoints in the strictest, old school sense of the word. As resources dwindle and the paths to explore splinter and multiply seemingly endlessly, a little misstep here or there could erase so much of my progress that I can feel just as trapped in these places as Puck does. Maybe that's the point, they don’t like it and neither do I.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, combat is full of your standard fare for a game like this. You can dodge around and swing a sword in a basic combo from the start. You unlock a power attack that is used alone for large ranged damage or linked to the end of your basic combo as a satisfying finisher. There’s an air dash, a grappling hook, a parry, etc. all waiting to be found and added to your repertoire as well, each of which cost a little bit of your ESP gauge to use. Running that meter to empty puts you in a Street Fighter 6-style burnout condition, meaning you can’t do anything but attack until it recharges again. This is a heavy penalty, but a meaningful one and requires you to really pay attention to how much offense you’re attempting to unload at once. Perks can alter you in smaller ways, like making your dodge cost less ESP or showing the remaining health of the last enemy you hit, but I haven't found enough of them to determine if their effect on combat is significant. At about 10 hours in, all of these elements have not yet combined to create a stylish flow or skill checking scenarios to  spice up the act of turning enemies into dust beyond much more than rote button mashing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puck can get in on the action on occasion, combining with your swordsman to become a sort of mechanical dragon creature that rips and tears until its timed energy bar is done. It’s fun to be big enough to ignore enemy damage and adverse terrain for a short period of time, but you are still largely just mashing the basic attack button until you can’t anymore. To recharge this mode, you have to devour fallen foes, which also give you various crafting materials that I have quite literally never looked at outside of the one time it was prudent to - the only time I’ve seen the vendor that deals with them was in passing early on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve run into quite a variety of different types of enemies to use all of this offense on, but you spend so much time in large zones that baddies turn from new challenges to nuisances pretty quickly. Enemies that you can’t simply whack to death at first sight are few and far between, and they’re rarely arranged in a way that makes them a real threat to progress, the occasional archer standing on a platform you need to jump up to hit notwithstanding. Bosses as of right now haven’t required much strategy outside of basic pattern recognition, either. A giant rooster mini-boss gave me an opportunity to use my air dash optimally just after unlocking it, but no other boss has nudged that kind of extra technical layer out of my combat strategy, yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am certainly a bit down on my time with Shadow Labyrinth so far. I’m leaving my expectations open for the possibility that its just a slow starter, even if 10 hours is a long runway to give a game like this in hopes it will take flight (we are told a playthrough could take 30+). I like but do not love its combat, which sticks to the melee-heavy metroidvania formula dutifully. I’m hopeful that the levels themselves evolve both in how they look and how they challenge my platforming and swordswinging skills, as they are showing small signs of ramping up the intensity. I'm not as optimistic for more compelling storytelling from the characters and spaces I'm presently in, as my brain has been wandering this seemingly endless maze of lore chasing the ghosts of the intense, affecting promise that the Secret Level short this is based on is teased.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green and the Multitude of Metroidvainias</h3><p>A mighty list of very good metroidvainias</p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinth-review]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Donkey Kong Bananza GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Nintendo has seemingly been switching many of the voice actors behind the company's collection of characters over the past few years. For instance, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toad-actor-says-nintendo-has-replaced-her-after-18-years/1100-6532176/">Princess Peach and Toad voice actor Samantha Kelly says she was replaced after 18 years</a> with Mario Kart World. In 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-will-no-longer-be-voiced-by-longtime-actor-charles-martinet/1100-6517020/">Charles Martinet stepped back from voicing Mario</a> after being behind the character since Super Mario 64 in 1996. Last month, Martinet explained that he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charles-martinet-wont-say-anything-weird-as-mario-to-preserve-characters-integrity/1100-6532374/">won't say anything weird as Mario for fans to preserve the character's "integrity." </a></p><p dir="ltr">As for Takeda, the actor actually has contributed to a couple of other big-name Nintendo games, too. Takeda voiced Master Mummy in Arms and Daruk in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donkey Kong Bananza launched today on Nintendo Switch 2. The game exists because Nintendo executive Yoshiaka Koizumi asked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-super-mario-odyssey-to-bananza-nintendo-acclaimed-team-takes-on-donkey-kong/1100-6532873/">the Super Mario Odyssey team</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-is-happening-because-nintendo-exec-wanted-a-3d-kong-game/1100-6533099/">look into a 3D Donkey Kong project</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lollipop-chainsaw-projects-coming-as-dev-signs-new-partnership.1246311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>developer Dragami Games has announced it's signed an agreement with Taiwanese "IP investment and development" company Nada Holdings to develop new projects based on the aforementioned hack-and-slash property.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/nada-holdings-and-dragami-games-launch-new-ip-development-for-lollipop-chainsaw/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official Nada Holdings website, the company says "multiple new projects" based on&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>&nbsp;will be launched as a collaboration between Nada and Dragami, although the company stops short of saying exactly what those projects will be.</p>

<p>Nada does, however, say that "cumulative sales" of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>have reached 1.5 million. That figure presumably includes both the original&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">last year's remaster</a>, since the company makes reference to "13 years of continued fan support".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=tjF6mMgJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=uSgYR-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nada, the new collaboration between itself and Dragami aims to expand <i>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</i>through "multifaceted projects and cross-industry collaborations", so presumably, it's not just new games the two are working on.</p>

<p>Dragami CEO Shohei Sato says the new projects will "carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise", while Nada Holdings chairman Joe Teng says his company will "devote itself wholeheartedly to preserving the spirit of the original work and meeting the expectations of its fans".</p>

<p>Teng also says the collaboration will result in a "wide range of new projects", which, again, indicates that we're not just in for a&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>sequel. I'd be surprised if there isn't some kind of anime series or streaming show in the works, as well as a spinoff or two.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game that was originally released way back in the mists of 2012 for seventh-gen machines. The original game was the result of a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>'s Suda51 and James Gunn, who's currently helming the latest&nbsp;<em>Superman&nbsp;</em>movie.</p>

<p>In 2022, a remake of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, but following requests from fans, the remake was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">scaled back to a remaster</a>, likely to stick to the developers' intentions of making the new version "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>In any case, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</i>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9ntpb0c2028v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;(as well as Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>
