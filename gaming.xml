		<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> Closed Technical Test for this coming weekend, bringing the public in to stress test and play the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> co-op shooter spin-off.</p>

Aiming to get as large an intake of invited participants as possible, the tech test will have two of the Jobs in the game,&nbsp;Paper Chase and Ground Control, and access to three of the kits with all equipment unlocked – Garden Gnome, Teapot, and Piggybank – and three of the guns.</p>

<p>For PC players, the system requirements that Remedy are pushing at this time are:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is launching on 17th June, dropping onto PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and Epic at that time.

			<p>Ukrainian game developer Frogwares&nbsp;<span>surprised its fans today with the sudden launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-remastered-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sinking City Remastered</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Even better, the game is free for owners of the original, and newcomers can purchase it at a 50% discount price ($24.99 on console, $19.99 on PC) for a few days.</span></p>
<p>This remaster leverages Unreal Engine 5 technology to improve the original game's visuals in various ways, as you can see in the trailer below. There are even some gameplay tweaks. Here's the complete list of improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The game is fully relit in Unreal Engine 5</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced locations with additional levels of detail and objects</span></li>
<li><span>4K textures and improved reflections</span></li>
<li><span>Photo Mode</span></li>
<li><span>Support for DLSS, FSR, and TSR upscaling</span></li>
<li><span>Various gameplay adjustments, certain accessibility features, and more</span></li>

<p>Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares, teased 'big things' for the franchise:</p>
<p><em>We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond. So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.</em></p>
<p>Less than two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an exclusive interview with Sergiy Oganesyan on The Sinking City 2. The sequel was funded through Kickstarter with $627K in pledges, which was 450% of the minimum target set by Frogwares. As a reminder, The Sinking City 2 will be a full-fledged survival horror game with greater emphasis on combat. However, Frogwares plans to maintain the investigation mechanics as an optional bonus feature that will make life in the game easier for those who choose to engage with it.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2019, Frogwares gained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-regain-control-of-the-sinking-city-but-all-old-saves-will-break-soon">full publishing rights to The Sinking City</a> last year following a legal battle with Nacon over royalties and funding, including allegations that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-devs-claim-publisher-pirated-the-game-to-release-it-on-steam">Nacon had pirated the game</a>. Frogwares are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-reveal-wet-survival-horror-sequel-the-sinking-city-2-taking-the-dev-in-a-newer-direction-in-2025">now working on a sequel</a>, which is slated for release sometime this year.</p>
<p>Alice Bell (RPS in peace) wasn't convinced by The Sinking City's take on Lovecraft or clumsy racism allegories <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-review-pc">in her review</a>, but thought the game worked well enough otherwise, calling it "a slightly janky, slightly grindy detective game that does some interesting things in a very atmospheric depiction of a profoundly depressed town".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> - the apparently very good third-person action extravaganza with a heroine who definitely only dresses like that because she's comfortable with her sexuality and besides, bunny girl outfits are lightweight and tactically efficient - will launch on 11th June, according to a new trailer. PlayStation appear to have posted the trailer early in a classic case of marketing butterfingers. They've now removed the video, but somebody from Reddit has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/">preserved and uploaded it</a> as an everlasting monument to Sony's shame.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The video walks us through a few of the PC version's new bells, whistles and features, including AI frame generation, higher resolutions, a bunch of bonus outfits, Japanese and Chinese voiceovers, a new boss fight, and ultrawide display support for players who are secretly owls with the ability to rotate their head almost 360 degrees. It all seems very swish. I like the spangly blocking effects.</p>
<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade was confirmed in February, at which time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jiggle-powered-apparently-decent-action-game-stellar-blade-confirmed-for-pc-release-in-june">I wrote a little about the console version's popularity/infamy among internet sexists</a>. To recap: this is very much an experience for people who like looking at shiny bottoms and wobbling chests. It also sounds like an accomplished graduate of Combo, Parry And Fishing Minigame University that deserves a lot of the praise it has received. Ah, history abhors a paradox.</p>
<p>I don't, personally, object to anybody wanting to look at a shiny bottom, providing their enthusiasm for shiny bottoms doesn't metastasise into e.g. the argument that Western civilisation is doomed thanks to a chronic dearth of bikini armour in Assassin's Creed. Anyway, we'll possibly have something less slapdash to say on the subject in June.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City Review</a></h2>
<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em>&nbsp;“The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>

The final amount raised in the Kickstarter was 553,100 euros, way above the target of 100,000 euros.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5.1187664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silver Studio and Elementa have unveiled a new free-to-play open world gacha game called Silver Palace. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game features a rather refreshing Victorian era-inspired setting, albeit still with the anime-like art style we've previously seen in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-will-soon-require-age-verification-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a>. The game is being developed for PC, console, and mobile devices, and the combination of the reveal trailer and 10-plus-minute-long gameplay showcase has already shown quite a bit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Trailer | The Golden Age of Detectives" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELC4r7fbKEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, Silver Studio also shared a detailed overview of the features and content:</p>
<p><em>Silver Palace is a brand-new ARPG set in a prosperous metropolis with a Victorian aesthetic. It features an engaging story, a delicate art style, distinctive characters, and a dynamic, action-oriented combat system. Players will play the role of a “Detective” and embark on an adventure with a diverse group of partners to defeat the unknown enemies and unravel the mysteries in Silvernia, an industrialized metropolis built on the power of Silverium.</em></p>
<p><em>The discovery of Silverium was the key to Silvernia’s industrialization. This revolutionary element transformed technology and daily life beyond imagination, attracting numerous residents and fostering innovation. The city became a hub of miracles, driven by the massive industrialization and monetization of Silverlum under the city’s administration.</em></p>
<p><em>In Silver Palace, players assume the role of a “Detective” tasked with investigating crimes and uncovering hidden truths. As various factions—from corporate monopolies and underground syndicates to royal affiliates and cults – vie for control of Silverium, tensions rise across the city.</em></p>
<p><em>Players can switch between characters in real time to unleash powerful skills and chain QTE combos. As they explore the city’s sprawling environments, they’ll dive into the scenes of crime, hunt for clues in the shadow, battle their enemies and in the process reveal more of the stories of Silvernia.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIUa74hDJiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-registration for PC and mobile devices (which will likely launch before consoles, as usual with these games) can be submitted <a href="https://silverpalace.elementagames.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official game website</a>.</p>

<p>Not a shield in sight. Just old time, good time, down home rocket communists riding flying machines made of revolver parts, cannibalism, and a "hookshot-hat". Bafflingly, the trailer does not show the hookshot-hat, but I respect the restraint.</p>
<p>The west has been torn apart by the great War For Booze, and your once-idyllic family life has been shattered. So, you hop on your horse and set off to do some gun violence at communists over a series of open sandbox levels. Here are some features:</p>
<p>(Also, here's a grammar question for you, the discerning nitpicker. I always want write to "here's some features" but that's technically not correct because there's multiple features, but "here are some features" just feels so unnecessarily drawn out I want to expire and crumble into dust before I reach the end of the sentence. It's a bloody conundrum, it is! Little insight into the tortuous struggle I experience in the daily process of sausage making, there.)</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Story driven adventure set in open sandbox-like levels.</li>
<li>Dynamic slapstick combat.</li>
<li>Equipment system with upgradeable weapons and clothing.</li>
<li>Trading and cooking systems.</li>
<li>First person rolling, bullet catching, kicking, hookshot-hat, cannibalism, drinking booze and puking.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The description of "dynamic slapstick combat" puts me in mind of Blendo Games' recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>. I read something the other day about how one of the purposes of narrative design is to make the things you do in games seem less weird and stupid, but I'm a supporter of leaning into the opposite. I'm also reading Blood Meridian for the first time at the moment, and feel this would make an incredibly incongruent but just similar enough companion piece to make both experiences much stupider.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> Remastered - the Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up of developer Frogwares' 2019 Lovecraft-inspired detective adventure - has slithered out of its tenebrous seclusion sooner than expected, and is available now for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, The Sinking City tells the story of troubled private investigator Charles Reed as he travels to the supernaturally flooded city of Oakmont, Massachusetts, in search of a way to quell his hellish visions. There's a bit of gunplay as the cosmic horror begins to take hold, but mostly it's a game of exploration and investigation, playing out across a series of open-ended cases and the titular open world.
</p>
<p>
All that's true of The Sinking City Remastered, of course, but Frogwares is also promising an "upgraded visual experience alongside some requested quality-of-life features". There's talk of enhanced and fully relit locations with additional levels of detail and objects, for instance, alongside 4K textures, improved reflections, "various" gameplay adjustments, and new accessibility features. There's also a photo mode and, on PC at least, support for the likes of DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling.

<p>
To mark The Sinking City Remastered's arrival, Frogwares has released a new trailer showcasing some of the differences between the 2019 original and its new Unreal Engine 5 update. And if that's got you in the mood for some eldritch adventuring, The Sinking City Remastered gets its digital release today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/750130/The_Sinking_City_Remastered/">Steam</a>, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S - and it'll be available as a free upgrade for all existing owners.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares' remaster comes ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-smashes-crowdfunding-goal-in-less-than-a-day">successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a> earlier this year. The sequel is again set in 1920s America, but this time sees players exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham in an survival horror-style adventure said to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor</a> in favour of combat and exploration.
</p>
<p>
All this activity follows Frogwares' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-now-sole-publisher-of-the-sinking-city-following-dispute-with-nacon">lengthy dispute with publisher Nacon</a> over the rights to the original The Sinking City. Since a resolution was last year, the studio has taken over as The Sinking City's publisher, updated the Steam build, and released new DLC. The Ukrainian studio also found time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">crowdfund and release 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened</a>, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sherlock-holmes-developer-frogwares-shares-update-on-life-in-ukraine-amid-ongoing-war-with-russia">continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond," Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan wrote in a statement accompanying today's remaster news. "So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game's twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin."

            <p>
The Fallout TV series has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime.
</p>
<p>
That's despite the show's second season still being months away - and indeed, we now know Fallout's next batch of episodes will debut in December 2025.
</p>
<p>
More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed (thanks, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-renewed-season-3-release-date-season-2-1236394393/">Variety</a>), making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever.
</p>
<p>
Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer.

This video, released for Amazon's Upfront event, sees a pre-Ghoul Walton Goggins getting pitched advertising campaigns for various products (it's a humorous nod to Upfront itself, where Amazon seeks marketing pitches from brands). And yes - that is Amy Acker, AKA Fred from Angel! More of her character please.
</p>
<p>"We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world of Fallout," said Amazon TV boss Vernon Sanders paying tribute to the show's writing and production teams. "Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda">Bethesda Softworks</a>, we are delighted to announce a third season of Fallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of season two."</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-show-could-run-for-five-six-seasons-says-actor">Fallout actor Aaron Moten revealed that he expected the show to run for "five, six" seasons</a> in total.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-5-6-seasons-says-lead-cast-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that lead cast actor Aaron Moten expects the Amazon Prime Video Fallout TV series to last five or six seasons, based on conversations with the showrunners. A few hours later, Amazon officially renewed the show for a third season, while also announcing that the second season will air on Prime Video this December.</p>
<p>Vernon Sanders, global head of television at Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world of Fallout. Jonah Nolan, Lisa Joy, Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Graham Wagner have done an exceptional job bringing this beloved video game franchise to vivid life on Prime Video. Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and Bethesda Softworks, we are delighted to announce a third season of Fallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of Season Two.</em></p>
<p>Fallout TV series executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy stated:</p>
<p><em>The holidays came a little early this year – we are thrilled to be ending the world all over again for a third season of Fallout. On behalf of our brilliant cast and crew, our showrunners Geneva and Graham, and our partners at Bethesda, we’re grateful to our incredible collaborators at Amazon MGM Studios and to the amazing fans as we continue our adventures in the wasteland together.</em></p>
<p>Showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner added:</p>
<p><em>We’re so grateful to have survived the apocalypse for another season! Thanks to the incredible team — our whole cast and crew, Kilter, and Amazon.</em></p>
<p>The news came at Amazon Prime Video's Upfront presentation, which was held yesterday at New York’s Beacon Theater. As befitting such an announcement, we also got a season two teaser that you can see below, providing us with the first look at New Vegas in the Fallout TV series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout Season 2 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tu5EN8V35JM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a reminder, the Fallout TV series takes place around fifteen years after the events seen in Fallout: New Vegas, and the showrunners have already clarified that fans of the game will see a much-changed location. Still, there's little doubt that the debut of season two will once again see the fan-favorite game skyrocket up the most-played charts.</p>

            <p>Yes, yes, I'm opting for the scoundrel's gambit and reporting on a Reddit post. Of a self-imposed challenge run, no less! But I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">adored the bejeezus</a> out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and figured this was worth sharing in case it convinces a couple of you to give it a go. Redditor HunterIV4 has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1ki94qi/can_you_beat_the_game_without_dodging_yes_part_2/">chronicled their journey</a> to beat the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> without dodging, parrying, or even using the powerful gradient parries, in a bid to show that Sekiro reflexes aren't as crucial to success as they might seem.

<p>Tackling the game's story mode, HunterIV4 took the approach of bumping up their party's health as much as possible. It sounds like they had a fairly easy time through the game's first act, although they had to focus more heavily on effective builds for the latter portion. Personally, I enjoyed the buildcraft in Clair Obscur so much it's been a little disheartening to see it overshadowed by the Sekiro comparisons and what not. I do think this is partially a quirk of the design, since you can technically make the character building meaningless by just getting very good at button pressing. Still: good to hear that it does have the capacity to play like a more traditional turn-base 'em up.</p>
<p>HunterIV4 ended the second of their two posts with screenshots of both final bosses beaten with zero parries or  dodges. "Don't let concerns about a 'hardcore' experience prevent you from playing this awesome game and experiencing the story first-hand," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kfc7mz/no_dodgeparry_an_experiment_and_what_to_do_if_you/">they wrote</a>. "Despite the hype, this is not <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>."</p>
<p>Granted, this doesn't sound like the best way to experience the game - Act I took them much longer that they'd have like, apparently. But, hopefully it's tempted a few more of you to join the cult of Esquie's magnificent ass. The time of the airship is over, now is the age of the dump truck.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> will release on PC next month, according to a trailer posted too early on the PlayStation YouTube channel and since removed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-confirmed-pc-release-and-goddess-of-victory-nikke-dlc">PC version of the action game was announced back in February</a> but without a full date. Now we know it will launch on 11th June across Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The PC version will come with a number of extras, including an unlocked framerate, higher resolution environment textures, DLSS 4 and FSR 3, ultrawide monitor support, and more.</p>

<p>Further, there will be a new boss fight against cyber warrior Mann, as well as 25 new costumes for protagonist Eve.</p>
<p>Additional content from the console release will likely be included, like the NieR: Automata DLC and photo mode.</p>
<p>More DLC based on Shift Up's other big franchise Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also set to arrive on console alongside the PC release (and presumably on PC too), though it's not part of the leaked trailer - but is in the trailer above.</p>
<p>Shift Up stated in a financial report from February it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">expects the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">game received a PS5 Pro patch</a> in time for the new console's release, which Digital Foundry described as a "hugely effective upgrade". Soon we'll be able to see how the PC version compares.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>The discovery of Silverium was the key to Silvernia’s industrialization. This revolutionary element transformed technology and daily life beyond imagination, attracting numerous residents and fostering innovation. The city became a hub of miracles, driven by the massive industrialization and monetization of Silverlum under the city’s administration.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Silver-Palace-Ann_05-12-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>In <em>Silver Palace</em>, players assume the role of a “Detective” tasked with investigating <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>es and uncovering hidden truths.

A forum is an everlasting repository of knowledge, a place where questions can be asked and their answers enshrined forever, the solutions to someone's problem just a google search away. It's also a place where conversations are turn-based, and afforded all the nuance and contemplation the platform allows.</p><p>Discord, meanwhile, is a river that never stops running. It has some forum-like features, sure, and a search bar, but its conversations are supposed to take place in real time, which is fantastic for people who are around and talking at the same time, but far less useful for anyone coming around later. Like, say, those with tech support issues, which make up a huge percentage of video game community posts.</p><p>And yet! Companies just keep on making the move anyway. The latest example: DECA, a studio owned by Embracer that now runs games like <em>Star Trek Online</em>, <em>Champions Online</em>, and <em>Neverwinter</em>, will be moving all three of their communities in the coming months.</p><p>Via<a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/05/09/deca-is-closing-the-star-trek-online-champions-online-and-neverwinter-forums-in-favor-of-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MassivelyOP</a>, a boilerplate message left<a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/forums/neverwinter#/discussion/1268693/forum-discord-announcement?sso=eyJuYW1lIjoiIiwicGhvdG91cmwiOiIiLCJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiIxNDQzOTY4OTgxIn0%3D+f2b1bf6559dc9f73c0d97196634de43be029559b+1747025324+hmacsha1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> on all three forums</a> reads:</p><blockquote><p>After many years of community discussion on the forums, we've made the decision to migrate our resources to where most players are now actively communicating.

The second season of the hit Prime Video show will premiere in December, and the show has already been renewed for a third, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-renewed-season-3-release-date-season-2-1236394393/"><em>Variety</em> reports</a>.</p><p>The second season will “pick up in the aftermath of Season One’s epic finale and take audiences along for a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas,” according to a description included in <em>Variety</em>. Production wrapped on the season <a href="https://x.com/falloutonprime/status/1920533288629792880">last week</a>.</p><p>There’s no word on when the third season might premiere. Hopefully the early renewal means we’ll see it sooner rather than later.</p><p>The first season was excellent, and as my colleague Ash Parrish wrote, it got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">the postapocalyptic vibes exactly right</a>. Fingers crossed that the second season keeps up the quality of the first – I’ll be clearing some time during the holiday season to watch the new episodes.</p><p>The show has already gotten more than 100 million viewers worldwide, which makes the show rank “among Prime Video’s top three most-watched titles ever,” <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video">Amazon says</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The third game in the modern Doom trilogy, Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel, taking place in a more medieval time period, meaning your guns and weapons have a certain retro quality to them, like the new melee weapons and the new shield. Of course, there are still lots of guns and plenty of fast-paced shooting. Doom: The Dark Ages features a single-player campaign, and here's how long beating that will take you.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a

That estimate is for someone who is finding secret areas and collectibles during their run on normal difficulty, but not grabbing every single secret the first time through. GameSpot's critic Alessandro Barbosa took 18 hours to beat the game for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/">GameSpot's Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, doing some of the side content during that run.</p><p dir="ltr">That time can also vary based on difficulty, as Doom: The Dark Ages has several options to choose from, with the highest options likely taking longer to work through. For anyone looking to see everything it has to offer, Doom: The Dark Ages does offer a level select, allowing you to clean up any missing secrets without replaying the entire game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages mission list</h2><p dir="ltr">There are 22 missions in id Software's latest gory shooter.

Luna Nights is quite different from traditional games in the franchise, however, as it’s a metroidvania. You’ll play as Sakuya Izayoi, who must work her way through a dangerous mansion, recovering lost powers as she attempts to escape and return home. The original release of Touhou Luna Nights is sitting with “Overwhelming Positive” reviews on Steam. Fans of metroidvanias will probably find it to be an excellent addition to their catalog. Part of what makes it so compelling is its time-warping mechanic, which can be used to solve challenging puzzles.</p><p>Combat is quite exciting too, as you’ll use a “graze” system that gives your character additional benefits by narrowly escaping damage. And like any good metroidvania, you'll unlock a litany of useful skills as you work through its story. Give the game a look if you’re seeking a unique adventure to get you through the warm summer months.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomtoc-releases-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-its-popular-form-fitting-travel-case/1100-6531332/">Tomtoc Releases Nintendo Switch 2 Version Of Its Popular Form-Fitting Travel Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-store-star-wars-day-sale-2025-jango-fett-ucs-starship-free-lego-sets/1100-6530872/">Lego Star Wars Day Sale Is Live - Get Two Free Sets With Jango Fett's UCS Starship</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-all-launch-games-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/1100-6531115/">All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studio-ghibli-movies-limited-edition-steelbook-blu-ray-best-deals-amazon-walmart/1100-6530746/">Studio Ghibli Movies With Collectible Steelbooks Are Available For Cheap</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/8bitdo-best-controllers-amazon-restocks-tariffs/2900-6514/">8BitDo Halts US Shipments Due To Tariffs, But You Can Get Great Controller Deals (For Now)</a></li>   </ul> </div>
