            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For centuries, vampires have checked a lot of existential (and down bad) boxes as a perfect foil for our darkest cravings and existential dread. From Park Chan-Wook’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762073/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Thirst</u></em></a>, Tomas Alfredson’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Let the Right One In</u></em></a>, Neil Jordan’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1531901/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Byzantium</u></em></a>, and Ryan Coogler’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners/"><em><u>Sinners</u></em></a>, I’ve enjoyed contemporary vampiric teas, imbibing the malignant and intoxicatingly self-destructive codependency monsters that make the horror myth so alluring. Yet, like the monster, I craved more.&nbsp;</p><p>On impulse, I recently followed that gothic rainbow of vampiric yearning back to its origin. Not <em>Dracula</em>. Not <em>Nosferatu</em>. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Carmilla</u></em></a>–more specifically, writer&nbsp; <a href="https://electricliterature.com/carmen-maria-machado-carmilla-lefanu-vampire-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Carmen Maria Machado’s version</u></a> of the 1872 Gothic novella by writer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sheridan-Le-Fanu?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu</u></a>. Having emerged from an afternoon reading the novel from cover to cover, I realized that every iteration inspired by it, like Powerhouse Animation’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/castlevanias-final-season-gets-there-in-the-end-1846825280?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Castlevania </em>Netflix series</u></a>, were just watered-down versions, a realization inspired by Machado’s version rage-baiting me into queer enlightenment.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr">!!!!!!!! <a href="https://t.co/YHgotQvp4K?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/YHgotQvp4K</a></p>— 𝑳𝑰𝑽𝑰𝑵𝑮 𝑫𝑬𝑨𝑫 𝑮𝑰𝑹𝑳 🦇 (@screamnhorror) <a href="https://twitter.com/screamnhorror/status/1989129304094200151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>As <a href="https://pshares.org/blog/reading-carmen-maria-machados-update-on-carmilla/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Amelia Brown wrote in her Ploughshares essay</u></a>, Machado’s version of <em>Carmilla </em>is unquestionably “both playfully reclaiming a story that was never stolen while also reclaiming a history that definitely was; the literary history of queer desire.” In the introduction to <em>Carmilla</em>, Machado mentions a real-life event first noted by scholar Professor Leight, who posited that Laura and Carmilla were based on an affair between two women, Marcia Marén and Veronika, one which <a href="https://electricliterature.com/carmen-maria-machado-carmilla-lefanu-vampire-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Electric Literature</u></a> curiously notes no version of <em>Carmilla </em>had ever mentioned before Machado’s. The implication is that Le Fanu took the queerness (and low-key plagiarism) of a correspondence between one Dr. Hesselius and his patient, Veronika Hausle, and turned it into the foundational vampiric novella. In doing so, he excised parts that would’ve made the whole “Is <em>Carmilla</em> queer text” of it all crushingly obvious.&nbsp;</p><p>But Machado’s introduction is also a lie. She made up Leight, Marcia, and Veronika; Dr. Hesselius is cited in Le Fanu’s prologue, and is presumably a fiction, but without any of the queer context Machado adds. Or better put, Machado’s introduction is a flex of “manuscript fiction” as folks on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xjxxft/im_having_trouble_verifying_carmen_maria_machados/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>r/books subreddit</u></a> I quickly flocked to put it. Machado, for my estimation, was using the same benefit of the doubt introduction Le Fanu used in his equally dubious 19th-century prologue, to (perhaps too cutely) reclaim <em>Carmilla </em>as an inalienable queer tale with vague gestures at made-up figures to give credence to that fact.&nbsp;</p><p>Put simply, I was reading a version of the book at war with itself, and one where I arrived at my own truth about the intent, and lack thereof, of its original author and the state of queer texts being a collective hallucination of starved readers or some slight of hand by the author to obscure its original meaning. It’s the embodiment of “I love spreading misinformation on the internet” housed in the perceived sanctity and empirical truth of a book. Still, like a vampire’s familiar putting up with hickies on their neck, I gave in to the lucid, Mandela effect reading experience that Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>was inviting me into and found the pieces I walked away with to be beautiful enough to be my own truth about the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix/Powerhouse Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Carmilla </em>is delightfully riotous. A slow-burning mystery, it follows Laura, a rich girl who, after insisting that her wealthy father let a mysterious girl named Carmilla stay at their secluded mansion, experiences a strange sickness as she, her father, and housemaids piece together that her unbearably pretty roommate has been treating her like a Capri-Sun pack for weeks. Machado’s edits exist as footnotes gingerly spread throughout the book, and despite the deception of the introduction, don’t rearrange words for modern audiences.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite (and very loud) “excisings” among Le Fanu’s omissions of Veronika’s correspondence to her doctor that Machado places in her introduction is a letter where Veronika writes, in no uncertain terms, that the Victorian gals consummated their affair: “I descended the valley of her, over and over, until neither of us could locate our breath.” Contrast that with Le Fanu’s portrayal of Laura and Carmilla’s relationship, where Laura registers Carmilla’s toxic affections as merely sinister—never as the site of a conflicted, inchoate sexual awakening. Machado treats this tension not as subtext but as text, both inventing and excavating the erotic charge buried beneath Le Fanu’s pearl-clutching editorializations of Veronika’s letters to Le Fanu’s doctor. Letters, mind you, that Le Fanu dared to preface in his 1871 prologue by noting that the author of these letters (in this edit, Veronika) was already dead—and thus, in his words, “she probably could have added little to the narrative which she communicates, with such fastidious detail, in the following pages”—before proceeding, in Machado’s casting, to redact her correspondence with a smug confidence that omits all the most revealing parts.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s fabricated reasoning not to include excised text from Veronika’s letters into <em>Carmilla </em>as told from Laura’s perspective (which, again, don’t exist), while admittedly “petty,” felt to me like reading one of those “this you” quote retweets while also dunking on the original poster:&nbsp;</p><p>“I wished this edition to bear LeFanu’s shame. I wish the reader to come to the book with a complete understanding of its inadequacy…I hope you will enter into <em>Carmilla</em> thusly, using your fingertips and mouth and mind to locate the lacunae where Le Fanu excised pieces of Veronika’s account, the hallways haunted by the specters of truth and phantoms of passion. See if you cannot perceive what exists below: the erotic relationship between two high-strung and lonely young women. The shared metropolis of their dreaming. An aborted picnic in the ruins.”</p><p>But, like a vampire's familiar, I decided to give in to the fantasy of <em>Carmilla</em> secretly being a glinted queer text that I was getting in on the ground floor of. And boy howdy was I picking up what Machado was putting down.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>seeps with imaginary contempt and is cattily packaged. The footnotes explain the story like a friend candidly recounting drama from the night before. They provide shorthand annotations explaining what fancy words mean to the everyman while also removing the veil of elegance by spelling out things for what they are. Machado vividly enunciates the danger and desire coursing through Laura and Carmilla's roaring romance by reframing its gothic gestures as intimate, juvenile dramas. Carmilla's nightly visits become the secretive scurrying of a girl hiding under her friend's bed. Meanwhile, a passing mention of Cleopatra's tapestry transforms into a sly metaphor for erotic vulnerability. A breast bared not for pocket watch-flexing bling but for creatures to be drawn to the pulse beneath its bosom.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix/Powerhouse Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a kept promise of Machado’s shrewd, lean addition to Le Fanu's <em>Carmilla </em>enduring as a shame in delighting in the Gothic yearning and sapphic doom of its text, Machado’s notes cut through the flowery language about rapid breathing and “a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation, supervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion” to write frankly, “If this isn't an orgasm, nothing is.” All of this, naturally, takes place on the sixty-ninth page of the 139-page novel. Sensational.</p><p>By the end of Machado’s <em>Carmilla</em>, I witnessed my perception of <em>Carmilla</em> transform from an empty vessel of plot proportion and danger to a Promethean flame that sets Laura ablaze, her blood running with the most tremendous excitement of her boring, rich girl life. I also was left gazing, hands folded behind my back, wondering if Veronika/Laura—the spitting image of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Sorrows?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows</u></a> by the climax of the novel—ever writhed in agony knowing her lovely creature would never cup her face in her hand, plant butterfly kisses on her cheeks and eyelids, or say her name again. Carmilla, Laura’s ferociously alive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Wabi-sabi</u></a>, overnight transitioned into a story she must tell to someone, anyone, to keep alive. In Machado’s telling, her real-life counterpart sought to sort it out by seeking counsel from Dr. Hesselius, before having her tale told by Le Fanu for profit and paraded in homages that didn’t know the original source to whom they were riffing.&nbsp;</p><p>The main trait of any vampiric tale is that of doomed yearning and excess. To that end, Machado invites readers to savor the curated meal she has prepared, even if it means transforming Le Fanu into a blithering idiot of a sous chef, where his every perceived sapphic omission acts as the excess fat that makes the marrow of Machado’s dish all the more savory. Whenever queerness rises to the surface of Le Fanu’s text, Machado nudges it into the open while practically looming over your shoulder to nod at your inquisitive glance at that line you just read being gay AF.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>lets readers who want <em>Carmilla</em> to be a queer text to say that it is: a black rainbow of a formative horror novella. A four-car pile-up where megalomania, hubris, yearning, and infatuation crash. A book that's one-size-fits-all and sapphic as hell for all the languishers of the world to let out a heavy sigh of relief, feeling seen by a take on the vampiric tale that nudges queer subtext into the sunlight for all to see. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Waiting for a reincarnation</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoko Taro, the creator of the Nier and Drakenguard games, has been awfully quiet lately. Though he's worked on some smaller projects (writing scenarios for Voice of Cards, and a few mobile games), the lack of a proper Nier follow-up or other new major game from him has been getting under fans' skin. But according to Taro, he <em>has</em> been working on projects. They just keep getting canceled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from his remarks at Korean gaming convention G-Con 2025, which were <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on by 4gamer</a> and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translated by Automaton</a>. The panel, which featured Taro and Bayonetta and Okami director Hideki Kamiya, saw the pair asked for updates on recent projects. Kamiya mentioned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-okami-2-from-our-exclusive-interview-with-its-creators">the upcoming sequel to Okami</a>, while Taro said he'd been very busy with new projects, they just keep getting canceled partway through.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to NieR’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t  doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Taro isn't discouraged by this, apparently. He continued, saying he'd rather fail repeatedly and eventually create something good, rather than put out multiple mediocre works. “I believe that if I’m going to release something weird, I’d be better off not releasing anything at all.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/18/gettyimages-477373540-1-1763485628367.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoko Taro introduces Nier during the Square Enix press conference at E3 2015.

Especially since Nier: Reincarnation, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">was effectively a sequel to Nier: Automata</a>, is still completely unplayable by virtue of being a mobile gacha game that's since been taken offline with seemingly no plans to rerelease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So good luck to Taro, hopefully we see a new project from him that makes it to release sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the summer of 2012, ROUTINE was revealed at the largest video gaming convention in the world Gamescom, but after well over a decade later it has yet to make it into the hands of players. In the coming weeks, that’s all about to change, and as I sat down with two of the game’s three developers, Aaron Foster, head of art and design and project lead, and fellow artist and designer Jemma Hughes, it was all smiles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll have gone gold in just a few days,” Aaron told me with a grin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Theirs is a classic indie developer story, a handful of developers setting out to work on a project they were passionate about, learning every difficult lesson along the way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Routine started as a very simplified, atmospheric, slight-horror game. I started it on my own, and was actually inspired originally by the simplicity of Dear Esther,” Aaron said. “I wasn’t a programmer at the time. I was an environment artist, actually, and wanted to use my experience to make a game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I grew up in the 80s watching VHS's and it left a big impression on me.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I grew up in the 80s watching VHS's and it left a big impression on me. Now that I’m an environment artist, I’ve never stopped loving that aesthetic. I love the weathering and the hum of fluorescents and little details like that. When making Routine, I thought, ‘if I made this game in the 80s, what would I imagine it like?’ and so, sorta took that and ran with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Jemma and our programmer, Pete, came on that really opened a lot of doors for us. We started showing a few screenshots and eventually got help on audio, so that’s when we were ready to show the trailer.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aaron and Jemma’s environmental art chops were more than enough to catch the attention of masses, and when they released their reveal trailer in 2012, their self-published little endeavor left an impression on people. But then work on the project suddenly halted, and wouldn’t pick back up again until 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There was quite a long delay that was due to personal reasons, actually. We were dealing with almost going personally bankrupt and had to pause and work on other projects to make ends meet,” Aaron said, with the difficulty from those years apparent in his voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually their situation improved, though, and there was still a lot of passion among their small, but mighty team to pick the project back up. However, doing so after a years-long hiatus proved no easy task. The first obstacle was that the development landscape had completely changed, including, most consequentially for their team, the tools used to make them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we picked up development again, we actually had to start from scratch, because we’d worked on the game for 4 or 5 years in Unreal 3 Engine, then came back in 2020 on Unreal 5 using a completely different code – C++ instead of Unreal Scripts.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so the team took the opportunity to make ground up changes to Routine that spanned gameplay, art, and more. Having learned a lot from their time developing on Unreal 3, the team decided to refocus gameplay around a less combat focused design, give the story a complete overhaul, and change the way AI worked, expanding on ideas in some places and trimming back in others to bring the project more in line with the team’s renewed vision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we weren’t paused, we were mostly gutting stuff that didn’t work. The C.A.T. was originally primarily a weapon. That was removed and turned into what felt more like an actual tool. You saw a lot of that in the demo you played. It even has an off button!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Routine - 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The C.A.T., also known as the Cosmonaut Assistance Tool is the primary way the player interacts with the world around them. A boxy, retro-looking multitool, you pick this handy item up early on and it evolves over time as you find new modules for it. It was one of the big focuses during the rework after they started working on the game again, and Aaron’s eyes light up when he talks about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t want to make a bunch of modules, so instead we decided to make each module multipurpose. For instance, the ultraview module is a blacklight, but also a flashlight, so while the other one helps you defend yourself, it doesn’t have a flashlight, so there’s more than one reason to have one module equipped at any time,” he told me.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The C.A.T. does cool things like lets you connect to terminals, so it’s kind of like your cell phone, a camcorder, a flashlight – a multitool.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“It also does cool things like lets you connect to terminals, so it’s kind of like your cell phone, a camcorder, a flashlight – a multitool,” Jemma added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are more modules than what you’ve seen though. There’s one more later in the game. It may or may not help you defend yourself,” Aaron said with a laugh.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There were more changes beyond the C.A.T too, including a refocusing on the setting, which takes place on the moon. The moon is something of a fascination for Aaron, and something he wanted front and center. Before the pause in development, they’d increasingly built indoor environments where players couldn’t be blamed for forgetting they were on the moon at all – a state the team found unacceptable. Having played the demo recently, the moon is almost omnipresent, especially early on when they take every opportunity to shove the moon’s desolate vistas in your face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Narrative was also a huge change. The stuff we had before took away from the setting of the moon, we thought, and so we wanted to refocus on that,” Aaron explained. “I’ve always just been drawn to the moon. I think it looks just beautifully barren, and mysterious, and a bit creepy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of creepy, as you explore the space station, you’re never far away from the game’s primary threat – the Type 5 robots that attack you on sight and which cannot be dealt with using force. These heavy, metal Terminator-looking monsters are a sight to behold, and make the most alarming noises when they’re around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The AI got a rework too. Actually, you may not have noticed this, but the Type 5 robots are only ever active one at a time. That got changed at one point for reasons related to the narrative.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I’ll admit, I didn’t notice this, and actually spent minutes on end hiding from robots I had no idea were deactivated and unable to see me. Aaron and Jemma found this pretty amusing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, usually there’s this moment in some of the playtests where they’ll notice the robot just standing there and sort of peek out and then go ‘oh, he’s turned off’ and then you can walk right in front of them and see they don’t notice you at all,” Aaron said. “Just don’t be there when they come back on!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked about the design behind these terrifying monstrosities, Aaron explained there's a completely rational explanation for why someone built them to look like the stuff of nightmares, and also for how these could exist in the same universe as the tiny, boxy helper robots you’ll find scurrying about on the same space station.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Type 5s are actually repurposed riot control robots from Earth, so that’s why they look intimidating and a bit scary as you saw. The purpose of the IC robots is to be helpful, so they look cute.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked how Routine stands out in 2025, where we’ve enjoyed an absolute tidal wave of awesome games to play, Aaron spoke to the philosophy of letting players learn for themselves – a practice that’s less common in the age of in-game characters explaining puzzle solutions to you a few seconds after you encounter them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s just a very different kind of experience. We don’t hold your hand and make the player figure stuff out and there’s just not a lot of stuff like that out there at the moment.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who spent about 20 minutes beating my head on a single puzzle during the demo, I can attest that this is certainly true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before wrapping my call with the team, I paused to ask them what advice they would give to indie developers setting out to make their first game as they started to do all those years ago. Aaron’s answer came after only a second or two of thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the most important things is just work on something you care about, regardless of scale. If you care about it, you’ll be able to see it through. We knew we wanted to finish this game and we did. It took a while, but we all cared about it, and here we are.”</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-is-an-indie-horror-game-over-a-decade-in-the-making-developer-interview-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Even more tweaks for an already massive update.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> team snuck in a few extra changes alongside the California Resistance Season 1 update today, revealing changes for Escalation, challenges, and player profile kill/death statistics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last-minute additions to today’s 1.1.2.0 update arrived in the form of <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1990799899080688037?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a surprise social media post</u></a> this morning, just a few hours after the gargantuan patch targeted some of the fan feedback EA and Battlefield Studios have received in recent weeks. California Resistance most notably adds new map Eastwood into the mix, but these new bonus adjustments aren’t exactly anything to scoff at, and they’re already live.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list is a change players have been looking to see for one specific Battlefield 6 game mode: Escalation. BF Studios confirmed the tweaks, which increase objective capture time by about 20%, are a direct result of fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This change gives your squad more time to react, reposition, and coordinate vehicle spawns while maintaining the mode's fast-paced intensity,” the message says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lower on the totem pole of fixes is yet another fine-tuning for challenges. Where past updates have added clarity to and reduced requirements, this smaller, backend change implements a fix for completed challenges that failed to give players their rewards. Finally, BF Studios says player profiles will no longer reflect Portal kill and death statistics in the full kill/death count. Instead, only human kills will be recognized here, with an area for Portal kills set to arrive in a future update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are small but necessary changes for many, with Battlefield 6 players still enjoying all of the more substantial tweaks delivered with update 1.1.2.0 and California Resistance earlier today. In addition to Eastwood, new guns, and new features, the update reverts aim assist settings back to those seen during the August open beta while also continuing to tackle weapon bloom and dispersion.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guild Wars Reforged - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, ArenaNet is doing something similar once again. Reforged will include the original game's Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns (but doesn't seem to include the Eye of the North expansion) for one price. It will additionally come with some new bells and whistles to improve the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is controller support, which should make the game Steam Deck verified (though that official designation is still pending, according to the Guild Wars Reforged website). It will also bring some graphical improvements like better rendering, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom effects, new HD skill icons, and larger text options. High-DPI support is also being added for high-resolution monitors.</p><p dir="ltr">On the audio front, Guild Wars Reforged has been "rebuilt" with 3D environmental audio. In terms of actual gameplay, the only real change is a new quest-tracking and direction system that will better guide players to where they need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, it's far from a full-fledged remaster, but does look to update Guild Wars for the modern age and make the actual act of purchasing Guild Wars simpler for prospective players. All the improvements found in Reforged will be a free update to those who already own previous versions of Guild Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">While Guild Wars continues to celebrate its legacy, its sequel continues to forge ahead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-sixth-expansion-arrives-in-october-with-a-new-beachside-housing-option/1100-6533145/" data-ref-id="1100-6533145">Guild Wars 2 saw the release of its sixth expansion</a> in October--one that added new elite specializations to the game's professions, new housing options, and more.</p>

<p>Check out the first trailer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Netflix's animated series, <strong>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</strong>, is returning to the streaming service next month, with season two kicking off on <strong>11th December</strong>. And look, we even have a trailer!</p>
<p>This second and final season, which once again stars Hayley Atwell in the titular role, sees Lara and co. race across the globe to get their hands on some ancient masks that pack some mysterious powers. There's an uber-rich "techno-visionary" trying to hunt the relics down too, so no prizes for guessing who the goodies and baddies are in this situation.</p>
<p>The all-new trailer (above) gives a taste of the animated action we can expect to find in December, with super-powered headwear, globe-trotting escapades and a fight with a shark — yes, really.</p>
<p>The first series was met with mixed reviews on release last year, but with a live-action adaptation in the works at Amazon and the 2013 game making a surprise appearance on Switch and Switch 2 today, perhaps there will be more interest this time? Somehow, we doubt it, but hey, it's a good time to be a Tomb Raider fan!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA have announced that there will not be an F1 game launching next year and instead, F1 25 will be getting paid DLC.&nbsp; “The decision to offer a premium content update for F1 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise,” they explain.</p>
<p>The 2026 DLC will “bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers,”&nbsp; but no other details have been revealed. The next game in 2027 is going to refresh the franchise so it “looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.”</p>


<p>“F1 25 has been an incredible success, fueled by the passion of fans and the energy of the sport. With Formula 1’s momentum on and off the track, now is the perfect time for us to look ahead and build for the future<em>. </em>We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world,” adds Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed F1 25’s entry in the yearly sporting franchise, which brought its own fictional F1 story to the table with the third Braking Point tale. Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">our review</a>, “F1 25 is a clear improvement over last year’s entry, with improved handling, the returning Braking Point story mode and more all coming together to create an excellent F1 racing experience.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-25">F1 25</a> was enhanced with a DLC pack that was inspired by F1 The Movie, the&nbsp;content comes in the form of six Chapter Scenarios, which are available either as part of the Iconic Edition or to be purchased separately. These events take you to key moments from the movie, tackling dramatic weather, strategic moments and overcoming the odds at Silverstone, Monza, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Spa-Francorchamps, and Abu Dhabi. Completing these scenarios unlocks Sonny Hayes’ helmet for use in F1 World and Driver Career.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Giants Software has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone since the game launched just over a year ago.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has hit four million sales across all platforms, which puts it ahead of fairly major hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide" rel="nofollow">Konami's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake</a>&nbsp;(although it's still trailing major breakout hit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>).</p>

<p>Giants isn't slowing down with content for&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, either; a second season pass has been released today, and it promises lots of new content throughout the rest of the year, including a brand new JCB tractor that's ready to claim right now if you own the pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/giants-software-farming-simulator-25-sales-4m.jpg?itok=tISs1FLc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/giants-software-farming-simulator-25-sales-4m.jpg?itok=R8qqkj9F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Giants Software. Never change.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned vehicle,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>'s Year 2 Season Pass will also bring a major DLC pack somewhere between January and March, followed by another between April and June.</p>

<p>They'll be chased up by a major expansion that will launch between October and December this year, which will introduce a brand new map and more to the farming simulator. It sounds like there will be plenty of players waiting to greet that pack as well.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, it's...well...it's a farming simulator, and it's this year's iteration of Giants Software's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-22-sales-surpass-3-million-units-globally" rel="nofollow">successful</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-15-coming-consoles" rel="nofollow">long-running</a> series.</p>

<p>Released back in November last year, the game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-2-million-one-week" rel="nofollow">rack up two million sales for itself</a> within its first week of launch, which means it's picked up another two million in the intervening year. That's not bad at all, especially for what remains an essentially niche title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebecca Heineman, one of the co-founders of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>publisher Interplay, has passed away aged just 62.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interplay-co-founder-rebecca-heineman-dies-from-cancer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Heineman's death was confirmed by close friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Heidi McDonald</a> and former colleague <a href="https://x.com/BrianFargo/status/1990561629080277499" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brian Fargo</a> on social media yesterday. McDonald described her as a "trailblazing game industry bad-ass", while Fargo called Heineman "one of the most brilliant programmers around".</p>

<p>Previously, Heineman had set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoFundMe page</a> to help pay for treatment for her recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma, but yesterday, she said further treatments would be "pointless" according to her doctors, urging donors to give so that her funeral can help her "make a worthy entrance for reuniting" with spouse Jennell Jaquays.</p>

<p>Following her victory during that tournament, she co-founded Interplay Productions, the studio that went on to publish iconic and influential games like survival horror classic&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark</em>, CRPGs&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>and <em>Fallout</em>, and the European version of the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em>.</p>

<p>As well as being a major industry figure, Heineman was also active as an LGBTQ+ campaigner. She won a Gayming Icon award from <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gayming Magazine</a> this year, with the publication commending her "advocacy for LGBTQ+ inclusion, accessibility, and diversity in tech".</p>

<p>In her later years, Heineman was also active on streaming and video platforms, showing off some of the curios she had gathered over her decades working in the gaming industry. It's no stretch to say that without Heineman, many of the most well-respected games of today simply wouldn't exist.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale-rescued-by-original-co-founder-following-riot-shutdown.1357120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hytale co-founder and original developer Simon Collins-Laflamme has purchased the rights for the game back from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">original owner Riot Games</a>, following the shutdown of the project earlier this year.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> entitled “Hytale Is Saved!”, Collins-Laflamme says the project has been acquired from Riot Games in its entirety, and the new team is “fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next ten years”, a commitment he says he’s making alongside fellow director Philippe Touchette.</p>

<p>As well as reviving the project, Collins-Laflamme and Touchette have hired “over 30 former developers” who were working on Hytale prior to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">its closure in June</a>, and the two say they will “continue to hire as the budget allows” and as the right candidates for the game are found.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-rescued-original-developer-farmer_0.jpg?itok=NRmg4qmZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-rescued-original-developer-farmer_0.jpg?itok=SV0dvd94 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is making a return, so rejoice.</figcaption></figure><p>The new Early Access date for the revived version of Hytale will be revealed in the coming days, Collins-Laflamme says, as will the game’s pricing.</p>

<p>You should, according to the developers, expect Hytale to be in a pretty rough state when it launches, with “bugs, rough edges, unbalanced content, and frequent updates that break things” being par for the course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is partly due to the abandonment of the so-called “Cross-Platform Engine”, which would have ensured Hytale’s compatibility with other platforms; instead of using that engine, the developers have returned to Hytale’s original “Legacy Engine”, which they say is “playable now” and which will allow them to “build a game rather than an engine”.</p>

<p>Despite being a big part of the original Hytale release, official minigames won’t be a part of this revived version of Hytale at Early Access launch, but a dedicated team will work on bringing them into the fold “once the core game is stable”.</p>




<p>In the coming days, you can expect to see new gameplay footage and screenshots for Hytale, as well as detailed patch notes for what the team has been working on recently.</p>

<p>In addition, you’ll get a roadmap post showing what’s coming to Hytale in the future, as well as the aforementioned pricing details, an Early Access release date, and “plenty of updates and communication”.</p>

<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with Hytale, it’s an ambitious RPG sandbox that pledges to offer “a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures” that you can “shape…block by block”. Whether that original vision changes with new ownership and a new direction remains to be seen.</p>

<p>If you’d like to keep up with Hytale’s progress, you can do so via the <a href="https://discord.gg/hytale" rel="nofollow">new Discord server</a>, and you can keep an eye on the <a href="https://hytale.com/" rel="nofollow">official website</a> as well.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a> developers Inkle once pitched a Doctor Who game to the BBC, narrative director and writer Jon Ingold has revealed in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jon.inkle.co/post/3m5sx6jiqps2i">a Bluesky post</a>. While the BBC never responded to their overtures, the pitch became the basis for Inkle's very excellent and bodacious astral archaeology sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">Heaven’s Vault</a>. I consider this a cool thing to know, and so do our friends at Eurogamer. They’ve just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-inkles-heavens-vault-started-life-as-a-doctor-who-game-before-it-was-exterminated">published an interview</a> with Ingold, which includes tantalising details of a forthcoming Heaven’s Vault reveal of some kind.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Inkle met with a number of potential collaborators in 2014, following the release of 80 Days. According to Ingold: “one of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on. As a lifetime Doctor Who fan, that was the one we jumped on." The team spent eight months working on a pitch for something Who-flavoured and working-titled The Daedalus Effect. It would have been set on an asteroid orbiting a black hole, and would have featured time dilation. 
</p>
<p>
"For the art style, we wanted 2D characters within a 3D scene for a comic-book look, so we built a TARDIS interior model, drew some character art, and built a prototype where you could move around the console room," Ingold told Eurogamer’s Victoria Phillips Kennedy. "We also built a playable 'fly through the vortex' game for the travel sequences, inspired by Super Hexagon. And the most significant thing we did was start rebuilding the ink engine, from the very scrappy first version that powered 80 Days and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorcery">Sorcery!</a> series, to the more modern version that we eventually open-sourced."

<p>
Alas, the Who game was not to be: a decade later, Inkle are still waiting for a response to the Doctor Who pitch. This is possibly for the best, however. Heaven’s Vault is terrific, and Inkle are arguably in a stronger place for having embarked on their own original setting. "It opened Inkle up a lot - until then we'd be doing adaptations and IP-based work," Ingold noted. "Heaven's Vault was the first thing we did that was all ours - and people embraced it - and that experience is what made A Highland Song, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overboard">Overboard</a>, and all the rest possible."
</p><p>
Ingold isn’t sure they’d make a Who game today, fond as he is of that narrative jukebox, the Tardis. “I still love the character and the wild variety the concept would bring. But there's been a lot of Who games since 2014, and I feel like it'd be hard to capture the same excitement as we felt for the project when we first pitched it." 
</p>
<p>
Besides which, Ingold have their hands full with both a new videogame of some kind and a mysterious “thing”, possibly not a videogame, for the world of Heaven’s Vault, which has now expanded into the realm of novels and, potentially, stageplay. “We've written a pilot episode and outline for an audio drama version (though we haven't sold it to anyone), and we've got one other big thing cooking for the world which we haven't announced yet, but is hopefully going to be truly wonderful for new players and for fans of the original,” Ingold concluded.</p>
<p>You can read more on Eurogamer. Side note: I used to be an embarrassingly dedicated fan of Barbara Hambly’s Darwath books, and they have a wizard character called Ingold I would roughly classify as Sports Illustrated Gandalf. Science has yet to prove that he and Jon Ingold are not the same person.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-the-kotaku-review.1357111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It was around the time that I was fighting a giant plant monster in a chemically induced hallucination themed around hate and guilt that I realized this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a strange one. But moments of strangeness, even a few memorable or inspired ones, can’t hide the fact that this latest installment is the digital equivalent of throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span>’s co-op campaign is a direct sequel to </span><i><span>Black Ops 2</span></i><span>, featuring many characters from and references to this fan-favorite entry. Yet in the end, all those nods to </span><i><span>BLOPS2</span></i><span> just serve as a reminder of how much better that campaign was than this collection of random ideas that you can play either solo or with up to three other buddies.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>And then…and then…and then….</b></h2> <p><span>If I were to describe the plot of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>to you out loud, I would sound like a 6-year-old kid who was asked to come up with a big action-packed story on the fly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>“Okay, so some soldiers go to a secret island to fight a bad lady and her evil company, but it’s a trap, and they are drugged with a gas like from the Batman movies that makes you see scary stuff from your memories and past. Oh, and they are all connected via brain chips, so they all see the same things. And then they fight bad soldiers. Oh, and robots! And also zombies. And then a giant plant monster. And then a giant person. And they go to Tokyo. And then fight some spiders. And then they uh, oh, start a prison riot with undead inmates and uh go underwater to fight giant mechs using big missiles before winning and saving the day. The end!”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <p><span>It’s borderline nonsensical and only barely works as a story at all because of some great voice performances and some incredibly expensive-looking cutscenes. It’s a shame that the entire four- to five-hour campaign feels cobbled together in a short amount of time, but considering Treyarch, which co-developed this game, was also the lead developer on last year’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i><span>, it’s not surprising, either.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>At least the guns still feel good, and I wasn’t bored because when you’re dealing with this level of batshit nonsense, it’s at least interesting to see what ludicrous scenario the game is gonna throw you into next. Shooting, sliding, jumping, and now wall-jumping (more on that later) are fun regardless of what I’m killing. Less fun and more annoying is that RPG elements have woven their way into the campaign, so you reach points where enemies take a lot of bullets to kill, and you have to wait for the game to decide to end your pain and give you a damage upgrade. Bleh. No good. Don’t like. Never bring this back, thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Speaking of annoying things I never want to see return, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-slop-regulation-2000644735"><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span> introduces an always-online open world to explore between bigger missions. Even though I played solo, sometimes other players would speak during cutscenes when I was teleported back to this part of the campaign, which acts like an always-online pseudo-hub between some missions. And there’s little to do in these moments. It’s weird, adds nothing, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358">likely the reason I can’t pause </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"> while playing the campaign</a>, which is yet one more strange choice to add to the pile of odd decisions that make up this year’s</span><i><span> Call of Duty.</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Okay, whatever, what about multiplayer!?&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not stupid. I know that </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a multiplayer franchise. Most people are buying these games not for the single-player adventure, but for the months of deathmatch they’ll get to play with friends and randoms. And thankfully, this part of</span><i><span> Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is a lot better than the campaign. But if you played last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800"><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i></a><span>, you’ll likely feel a big sense of deja vu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> multiplayer feels very, very similar to that of the last entry, down to menus, perks, and gunplay. Now, that’s not inherently horrible, and considering how successful </span><i><span>BLOPS 6</span></i><span> was, it makes sense to build upon that for the follow-up.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, I found a lot of the weapons in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> to feel very same-y and not distinct at all. I bounced around a few guns in the dozen hours I spent with multiplayer and never found one I particularly liked or hated. They all just mostly blended together, with the only distinction being “Oh, this one is burst fire” or “This is a sniper.” I remember the guns in </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> being far more distinct and interesting, and swapping between them was a lot more exciting as a result, as were the firefights against other players.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maps aren’t a strong element of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, either. Some are genuinely very good, but those are mostly the maps ripped from past </span><i><span>Black Ops </span></i><span>games, like Hijacked (which also appears as a level in the game’s campaign). The new maps felt too big for the number of players found in most game modes, and none of them have stuck in my brain. Maybe in a few weeks, some of these new maps will join my list of best </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> maps ever made. But at the moment… ehhh.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“War never changes…wait a minute, is that a giant plant monster?”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Treyarch / various other Activision Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Near-future military online FPS with zombie survival mode  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Fantastic cutscenes, snappy and responsive gunplay, and wall-hopping.  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bad campaign, bland guns and maps, and performance problems.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5 (played), PS4, PC  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the campaign in about five hours, played 13 hours of multiplayer, and a few hours of zombies.  </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>Perhaps the biggest change found in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer is the ability to wall hop. This builds on the fantastic omnimovement that debuted in </span><i><span>Black Ops 6, </span></i><span>which let players sprint in any direction and made </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> faster than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Wall hops add a new tool to the movement kit, and I love it. Being able to bounce up a wall into a window or over a garage is so much fun. It can also be used to escape an enemy, ambush a group of unsuspecting players, or reach an out-of-the-way spot to do some camping. Shut up, it’s a legitimate strategy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While my old-man thumbs and fingers sometimes fail to keep up with the youth and their fancy slides, I still mostly had a good time with </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer, even despite the maps being meh and no one gun calling to me. Wall bounces add just enough extra flavor to fights to shake things up, while not getting in the way of the hyper-responsive FPS action </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> has long been known for.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I do, however, want to flag that on PS5 Pro, I ran into a ton of random performance issues during multiplayer. This really soured my experience. Even a bad </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> typically runs well, so I was surprised to see so many dropped frames and slowdowns happen in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>. Hopefully, a future patch can improve the situation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Zombies and the <em>Battlefield</em>-sized elephant in the room</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not a </span><i><span>CoD </span></i><span>Zombies expert, so I can’t speak to specifics about the mode in this year’s entry, but I can say that I enjoyed my time with it. In a lot of ways, Zombies in </span><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> feels like a return to the versions found in older </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> games, and I like that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You can play a classic rounds-based version of Zombies set in one map. I also appreciate that for the first time ever, when playing solo, you can leave a Zombies match and come back later and pick up where you left off. Fucking </span><i><span>wild </span></i><span>that Zombies has a pause option, basically, while the campaign doesn’t. Strange!</span></p>

 <p><span>I would try to explain the story of Zombies, but it is so obtuse and deep at this point, involving multiple dimensions and a dozen characters spread over multiple games and timelines, that I’m just not going to attempt it. There’s a new cowboy-like demon zombie who is really bad, and I think I’m supposed to kill him by completing the main quest found in the primary Zombies mode. To explain more would require a trip to the </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> Zombies wiki, and I’m not interested in falling down that wormhole.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000645203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645203">©Activision</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a vacuum, this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a weird, really big, and mostly bad misfire that I doubt hurts the franchise all that much in the long run. But if we look beyond </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>and consider the larger context, this might be the worst version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"> for Activision to have launched in 2025,</a> as it’s going up against the super popular, grounded, and back-to-basics </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I bounced between both games over the weekend, and I think that once again, moment-to-moment, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> looks sharper and plays better than </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span>. This has long been the case with these two FPS rivals. But when it comes to content and delivering what fans want, I think</span><i><span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6</a> </span></i><span>wins hands down.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Make no mistake, both games have flaws. But</span><i><span> BF6</span></i><span>’s problems can be solved with some patches and a few big maps. </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> can’t be fixed because it isn’t broken, it’s just a weird and incoherent mess that feels more like a fan mod or big update for </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> than a proper sequel. And it certainly doesn’t seem like the game </span><i><span>Call of Duty </span></i><span>needed in 2025, but rather just the one we got because Activision can’t let the franchise take a break. Ah well, there’s always next year…&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch%E2%80%99s-best-scene-is-as-funny-as-it-is-violent.1357108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> eight-episode run is over, and I stand firm in my belief that the best moment in AdHoc’s superhero workplace comedy comes in episode five, “Team Building.” As the title suggests, protagonist Robert Robertson III takes his staff of reformed villains out for a night at a bar. The problem is, they’re headed to a villain bar. Robert certainly doesn’t look the part, and the bar’s goon and lackey patrons are ready to start a fight when they see him there. What happens next is probably </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s best use of the old Telltale house style, and it’s got players popping off and covering their eyes in equal measure.</span></p>  <p><span>The fight begins with Robert getting a blow to the back of the head, then waking up with his team outside a fast-food joint. At first, you think Robert was knocked out cold and his team got him out of there, so now they’re all just crashing at the local, legally distinct Taco Bell. But then, the group starts to hand Robert his food, and suddenly, you have a QTE to stick your straw in your soda. All right, seems an odd moment to introduce a QTE given that the game uses those pretty sparingly, but—holy shit, I just stabbed a man in the face with a handful of darts!</span></p>

  <p><span>No, Mecha Man did not simply go down without a fight, and the Z-Team wasn’t about to let their boss get made a fool of at their favorite watering hole. So now we swap back and forth between the quiet calm of Z-Team’s late-night snack run and the comically violent excess of their earlier bar brawl. Folks, it’s absolute cinema. The whole fight is set to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6v3vKeg1Ws"><span>Thot Squad’s “Hoes Depressed,”</span></a><span> a catchy-as-hell cheerleader-style hip-hop bop performed by Prism, the Z-Team’s light-manipulating influencer. As the bass bumps through the bar, Robert and co. are making the Red Ring thugs regret even glancing in their direction.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are so many standout gags, I don’t even know where to begin. Prism using her light powers to swat away a man who dared to interrupt her performance, causing him to cover his face and scream that she “temporarily” blinded him, only for her to retort, “Fuck you mean, ‘temporarily’? Bitch, you blind foreva!” is a standout. I also love when the devilish Malevola opens a portal outside the bar, allowing Golem, the team’s giant mud monster who had been exiled outside the establishment, to come in like a bull in a china shop. Punch Up using his short stature to run around below most people’s line of sight and give everyone a fist to the nads is also pretty fun. Those individual character moments are great, but the most effective parts of the whole sequence are the QTE-driven transitions between chilling at the not-Taco Bell and Robert doing some of the most violent non-lethal things he can do to a low-level grunt.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Every time </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> went back to the restaurant and the Z-Team started giving each other shit about the way the night went, it went on just long enough to lull me into a sense of familiar ease, having forgotten the carnage I had just watched unfold. Then, someone would hand Robert something inconspicuous, like a hot sauce packet, I’d tear the packet open—and immediately be thrown into a scene of Robert yanking the cybernetic implants out of someone’s skull. By the time I was actually biting into the food I’d ordered, I knew not to let my guard down and braced myself for the game to leap back and show me what Robert bit into back at the bar. In addition to being very exciting to play, those moments have been some of the most entertaining to watch people react to, because even after </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has established this trick, it still manages to catch players off guard.</span></p>           <p><span>The whole ordeal does end up accomplishing what Robert set out to do, at least. The team becomes a lot closer, and, depending on your choices, will trust their boss more than ever. Sometimes, all you need to bridge the gap between heroes and villains is a good bar brawl.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fleshy, floaty, fabulous. That’s</span><i><span> Morsels</span></i><span> in a nutshell. A top-down action roguelike in which you collect creatures and swap between their unique powers, it shares familiar DNA with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-is-gonna-take-over-my-life-again-1619872452"><i><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nuclear-throne-challenge-completed-beat-the-game-with-1573122068"><i><span>Nuclear Throne</span></i><span>,</span></a><span> but with a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-style twist that has you collecting little creatures and harnessing their powers to overcome an on-screen frenzy of gnarly hazards. I love it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks great. It sounds great. I’m having a great time with </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span>, even if most of the game still feels like a hard-to-intuit fever dream right now. You technically play as a mouse who is gifted these shape-shifting abilities to take on the appearance and upgrades of various titular morsels as you climb the levels of a colorful sewer to thwart the domination of the cats above. Some shoot lasers. Some fart gas. Others augment your dash. Each comes with its own bubblegum-wrapper flavor text.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve only played three hours of </span><i><span>Morsels </span></i><span>so far. That is not nearly enough to work my brain around all of its unusual logic and hidden secrets, which like any great roguelike are embedded within the monotonous but rewarding fabric of trial and error. But it is enough to know that </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span> is not just a fun gimmick wrapped up in a slick aesthetic. I can’t definitively say it has the roguelike juice just yet. However, it is already one of the most intriguing games I’ve played this year.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000645176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645176">Furcula / Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Made by Furcula and published by Annapurna Interactive, </span><i><span>Morsels </span></i><span>counts among its development team programmer Iggy Zuk (</span><i><span>Bad Ice Cream</span></i><span>), artist Toby Dixon (</span><i><span>Atomicrops</span></i><span>), and composer Sam Webster (</span><i><span>Grindstone</span></i><span>). The world looks like it was made out of the intestines of cows who grazed on confetti and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD3jJ0LGPEQ"><span>sounds like</span></a><span> lo-fi acid jazz beats to fester to. With a bubbly bullet-hell action loop pulsing at its core, the overall effect produced is that of a trippy tea party hosted inside a garden full of composting garbage. I mean that in the most delightful way possible.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other thing to know about <em>Morsels</em> is just how much it revels in visual chaos. It’s not as simple as kill/avoid everything else that moves. In fact, playthroughs across meandering levels that often loop back around on themselves are full of strange creatures, neutral NPCs, and side objectives which don’t immediately explain themselves. On paper, <em>Morsels </em>sounds like pretty familiar genre fare, but the actual experience of playing it had me constantly asking “what the hell is going on?” while looking at my screen</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That frenetic sense of uncertainty and mystery, along with the beautiful art and an incredible soundtrack (maybe my favorite of the year) is making <em>Morsels</em> feel like a nice jolt of anxious energy after dozens of hours pulling</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155"><span>slot machine levers in RNG-heavy roguelikes</span></a><span> that reward you for playing them with making you play them less. Will it have the long-term depth of a </span><i><span>Spelunky</span></i><span>? We’ll see. For now, it has my attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports has announcemed that it’s not going to release F1 26 next year. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was revealed</a> that instead of releasing F1 2026 in 2026, EA Sports will release a paid expansion for F1 25. This expansion will represent <strong>“the 2026 FIA Formula One World Championship, including new cars, teams, and regulations.”</strong></p>







<p>The next game, then, is scheduled to release in 2027. EA says that the next game in franchise will be a “<strong>reimagined and more expansive EA Sports F1 game”</strong>. They said that the game will deliver a <strong>“deeply authentic and innovative Formula 1 experience.”</strong></p>



<p>Questions around the future of the F1 franchise at EA have been popping up ever since the launch of F1 25. That release was scheduled to be the last of the current contract, though there was an option to extend it for two years. </p>



<p>EA had initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ea-sports-f1-series-continues-with-two-year-option-pick-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to Insider Gaming</a> that the option was picked up to keep the franchise going. However, just hours later, the company retracted that confirmation saying, <strong>“Apologies for the inconvenience, but we’ve been informed that the information we provided earlier today is inaccurate and we don’t have any information at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>Since then, it had been silent from EA and Formula 1 on the state of the series and F1 26. Until now, that is.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and Formula 1 for added context on the decision to not release a game next year. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>







<p>What do you think of EA Sports releasing a paid update for F1 25 instead of F1 26 and waiting until 2027 to release the next game?

            <p>Those with Switch consoles who have had a hankering to play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> - that is to say, <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-tomb-raider-definitive-performance-analysis">the remaster of 2013's Tomb Raider reboot</a> - but have been unable to do so due to its lack of availability, well I have good news for you.</p>
<p>Today, Aspyr and Crystal Dynamics shadow dropped the game on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. You can check out a trailer for it below.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is the award-winning cinematic action-adventure that tells Lara Croft's emotional journey from an inexperienced young woman into a hardened survivor – with a stunningly lifelike world to explore," reads the official blurb, with the promise of "high-octane combat", the ability to customise weapons and gear, and of course some "grueling" environments which Lara will need to endure.</p><p>Along with the base game, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition also comes with all of the original DLC, as well as digital versions of the Dark Horse comic Tomb Raider: The Beginning, Brady Games' mini-art book Tomb Raider: The Art of Survival, and the 'Final Hours of Tomb Raider' developer video series. </p>
<p>It also includes online multiplayer for up to eight players.</p>

<p>Shadow Drop of the Tomb Raider</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Oooof, we love a good shadow drop – <em>love it</em>.</p>
<p>This is one of the coolest we've seen in quite some time, as Aspyr has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is now available – out of <em>nowhere</em> – on the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2013 by Crystal Dynamics as a full reboot of the legendary action-adventure series starring Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition gained critical acclaim for its more grounded approach to exploration, strong visuals, and brutal combat.</p>
<p>We're a little sceptical about the visuals on display here, though. Although this is the Definitive Edition, which was effectively a remastered version of Tomb Raider for the PS4, some key enhancements don't appear to be present here.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious one as far as we can see is the increased fidelity seen on Lara's hair. This was a big talking point back in the day, and if this was possible on PS4, why isn't it present here on the Switch 2? Our guess is the game has probably been optimised primarily for the original Switch and thus lost a few of those enhanced features.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. We're very keen to get stuck into this, and we're hopeful this means <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rise_of_the_tomb_raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will also follow suit at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Fans can already experience a bunch of classic Lara Croft adventures with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> on the Switch, with Aspyr adding newly enhanced visuals alongside the original PS1 aesthetics.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-f1-26-not-happening-f1-25-major-expansion-f1-27/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that it will not release F1 26 in the coming year; instead, EA Sports F1 25 will get a major expansion meant to cover the 2026 Formula 1 season, with the series returning to its regular mainline release in 2027 with EA Sports F1 27.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">announced in a blog post on the EA website</a>, in which EA claims the decision was made "<em>as part of a strategic reset for the F1 franchise</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following on from F1 25’s commercial and critical success - with praise from players, media, content creators, and F1 drivers alike - the team is building on the experience through a paid expansion," </em>the post reads.<em> "The premium content update will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The decision to offer a premium content update for F1® 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1® Franchise. In 2027, a new game will be released that looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨</p><p>EA SPORTS will release a paid expansion for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F125?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F125</a> in 2026, with the current game serving as the foundation for the 2026 season.</p><p>Additionally, 2027 will see the release of a new, reimagined EA SPORTS F1 title, that looks, feels, and plays differently.</p><p>📕 Read… <a href="https://t.co/Rk8hOmT1Yw">pic.twitter.com/Rk8hOmT1Yw</a></p></div>— EA SPORTS F1 (@EASPORTSF1) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Codemasters senior creative director, Lee Mather, added, <em></em><em>"We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world.</em>"</p>



<p>With Codemasters taking a year off in many ways to get ready for the next full release in 2027, it'll be interesting to see what the jump between F1 25 and F1 27 looks like. Also, regarding next year's big paid expansion for F1 25, meant to cover the 2026 F1 season, the price that expansion releases at will likely make or break the success of this experiment.</p>

Its upcoming Echo Aviation Controller is about the size of a console gamepad but squeezes standard features like joysticks and buttons to one side to make room for flight-specific controls like throttle levers and a dedicated trim wheel.</p><p>The Echo Aviation Controller is expected to be available in mid-December 2025 for $149.99 through the <a href="https://flyhoneycomb.com/">company’s online store</a>. It’s fully compatible with various PC-based flight simulators, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/785181/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a>, and it connects to a computer with a USB-C cable or wirelessly using a dongle, <a href="https://fselite.net/content/honeycomb-aeronautical-has-completely-revamped-the-echo-aviation-controller-for-the-better/">according to Calum Martin at <em>FSElite</em></a>, who went hands on with the gamepad at a recent event.</p><p>On the left side of the main controller you’ll find a thumbstick, four action buttons, and a second conical joystick used to control a simulator’s camera. Meanwhile, the right side is where all the flight specific controls are located: four throttle levers accompanied by a trim wheel that can be adjusted to maintain a plane’s altitude without additional inputs.</p><p>On the bottom of the Echo Aviation Controller are dedicated controls for adjusting the aircraft’s flaps, raising or lowering the landing gear, and activating the parking brake so you don’t have to reach for your keyboard as frequently. There are also two sets of shoulder buttons on the top edge, and on the back you’ll find a pair of sliding paddles that move in opposition and function as rudders, controlling the side-to-side movement of your aircraft’s nose and aiding in steering while navigating an airport and runways.</p><p>In addition to a hard shell carrying case, the Echo Aviation Controller will come with a collection of interchangeable caps for the throttle levers and other controls so you can customize and easily differentiate each of them by their shape or color if you’ve remapped their functionality.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/823018/honeycomb-aeronautical-echo-aviation-controller-gamepad-pc-flight-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's a bit more excitement than usual, even among veteran car-watchers like me, for next year's F1 season. You see, the series is bringing in some <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/fia-unveils-formula-1-regulations-for-2026-and-beyond-featuring-more-agile.75qJiYOHXgeJqsVQtDr2UB">new rules</a> governing what its cars will look like and how they'll perform, meaning there's more potential on paper for serious changes to the established pecking order. Given that, I'm a bit unsure how to feel about EA and Codemasters having announced they're not making an F1 26, instead skipping ahead to 2027 with a DLC to fill the gap.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Codemasters senior creative director Lee Mather <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">wrote</a> that this this call's been made as part of "a strategic reset" of the studio's F1 games, and stresses they and EA are "fully committed" to making F1 games going forwards. That last bit's probably in light of rally sim fans seeing this announcement and initially thinking '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">oh no, not again</a>', especially since Codies have released a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/formula-1">yearly F1 game</a> since 2010.</p>
<p>Instead of a new game for the first year of these new 2026 regulations, F1 25'll instead be getting a 2026 season paid DLC, which Mather wrote "will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers." Then, in 2027, there'll be a new F1 game that'll "mark the start of a new and more expansive F1 experience".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨</p><p>EA SPORTS will release a paid expansion for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F125?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F125</a> in 2026, with the current game serving as the foundation for the 2026 season.</p><p>Additionally, 2027 will see the release of a new, reimagined EA SPORTS F1 title, that looks, feels, and plays differently.</p><p>📕 Read… <a href="https://t.co/Rk8hOmT1Yw">pic.twitter.com/Rk8hOmT1Yw</a></p></div>— EA SPORTS F1 (@EASPORTSF1) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>On one hand, I've been on the side of yearly iterations of sports games often being pointless for years. Unless there are big changes planned, skipping a year and just doing a roster update to the last entry often feels like the better option for all parties except maybe the accountants. F1's a bit of different bag than ball sports, but taking a year to just see what the new rule changes do to the real world racing could well result in being able to simulate them better without as much of a scramble to react to anything unanticipated right out of the gate could be a similarly good call.</p><p>On the other, it'd maybe have made more sense on paper for F1 25, the last year of the current regulations which have been in place since 2022 and a season which has seen many teams skimp on current car development to concentrate on the all-new challenge of 2026, to be the year without a new game. Take a year to really have the developers delve into the new rules, and see if they can nail a fresh sim package and series revamp in time with them. Naturally, that assumes this pause was planned well in advance and hasn't seen me take into account any factors beyond what sounds good from the outside.</p>
<p>We'll see how it works out. As of right now, next year will be the first year in a long time I'll not spend part of digging into a fresh Codemasters racer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-15-inch-gaming-monitor-cheaper-than-budget-controller-now-lets-you-play-switch-on-big-screen-2000645164</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/portable-15-inch-gaming-monitor-cheaper-than-budget-controller-now-lets-you-play-switch-on-big-screen.1357060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo Switch users squint at the 7-inch handheld screen for hours on end and lose important visual details and straining their eyes in marathon gaming sessions. <strong>Portable monitors solve that by turning handheld consoles into proper gaming rigs</strong> wherever you go and acting as secondary displays for laptop productivity.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/"> 15.6-inch monitor gets 1080p resolution in an ultra-thin frame, now sitting at $49 instead of the usual $59 price tag</a>. That pricing undercuts budget gaming controllers but offers functionality that fundamentally shifts how you work and play on the go. The <strong>monitor itself weighs just 1.43 pounds</strong> with a built-in kickstand and makes it truly portable rather than another heavy accessory collecting dust at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display with 178-Degree Viewing Angles</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display supports 1920 x 1080 with IPS panel technology</strong> that keeps color and brightness accurate from extreme angles up to 178 degrees. You can position the monitor off to the side when giving presentations or working collaboratively, and colors won’t shift or contrast degrade for viewers at an angle. The designation of an IPS A-grade panel indicates even better panel selection with fewer dead pixels and more consistent backlighting than that found on less-costly panels.<strong> HDR support</strong> will extend the dynamic range in content that supports the feature, brightening highlights and deepening shadows to a more life-like image reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Low blue light mode</strong> reduces eye strain during extended viewing by filtering out harmful blue wavelengths that contribute to fatigue and sleep disruption. That matters during marathon gaming sessions or situations at work when you’re staring at screens all day for eight-plus hours. The screen also comes with a matte anti-glare coating diffusing any reflections from overhead lights or windows and keeps the screen visible under bright conditions where glossy displays become mirrors. <strong>Response time sits around 5ms</strong> and keeps everything smooth for casual gaming and video playback.</p>



<p><strong>Dual USB-C ports</strong> provide both power and video signal over a single cable when connected to supported devices. Newer laptops using Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode transmit video over USB-C and removes the need for a separate power adapter or video cables. The second USB-C port acts as a dedicated power input for those devices that cannot supply enough power over their USB-C ports. Additionally,<strong> a Mini HDMI port</strong> is available for older laptops, desktops, and game consoles that depend on traditional video outputs.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch connects through USB-C</strong> when the unit is docked or via Mini HDMI with an adapter, and it upgrades instantly from a 7-inch handheld screen to a proper 15.6-inch display. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles all connect via HDMI, making the portable monitor a dedicated gaming display for bedrooms or travel.</p>



<p>It has dual built-in speakers along the bottom edge and offers stereo sound that is much clearer and louder than laptop speakers. The audio quality remains adequate for video calling, casual gaming and streaming content, though serious gaming or music listening could benefit with headphones or external speakers. The volume controls sit on the side panel alongside power and menu buttons for adjusting brightness and contrast and selecting between inputs.</p>
<p>The monitor <strong>does not rely on external power adapters in the case of devices</strong> that supply sufficient USB-C power when connected. This ensures cable simplicity during travels. In the event of low-power devices, connecting the second USB-C to a power source becomes necessary-an addition of one more cable to your setup. Power consumption remains less than 10 watts during normal use, hence drawing little power from the connected laptops or power banks.</p>
<p>You pay less than most budget game controllers for a full 1080p display that expands your gaming and productivity capabilities at $49. Most competing 15.6-inch portable monitorsbetween $120 to $200 with similar specs which makes this sale drop the price to buy levels.</p>

              <p>The cost of gaming is too damn high. Seriously, these machines just keep going up in price and every year it feels like we’re getting closer to $90-$100 games. Keeping an eye on sales is essential these days, and thankfully, if you’re in the market for a PS5, you can save a full Benjamin on the cost of a new one thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-friday-2025-ps5-discount-sale-pro-2000644002">Sony’s Black Friday 2025 deal</a>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">One Year Later, I’ve Forgotten I Even Own A PS5 Pro</a></p> <p>Black Friday, the most sacrosanct of consumerist holidays, will see Sony offer a suite of PS5 bundles, as well as a flat $100 discount on PS5 Digital Edition, the disc-based version, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">the PS5 Pro</a>. Sony has outlined the specifics of the deals over on its official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/18/playstations-black-friday-deals-2025/">PlayStation blog</a>. Console savings include:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1">The PS5 Digital Edition 825GB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $399.99 USD and the PS5 Console 1TB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $449.99. The bundle offerings feature PlayStation-exclusive in-game content** and 1,000 V-Bucks.</li> <li aria-level="1">In select regions, players can also save $100USD on PS5 consoles and $100 USD on PS5 Digital Edition consoles.*</li> <li aria-level="1">Gamers looking for the most visually impressive PS5 gaming experience can also save $100 USD on PS5 Pro consoles.*</li> </ul> <p>But that’s not all. Sony is also taking $100 off of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-vr2-ps5-sony-oculus-meta-quest-valve-index-alyx-1850121563">PS VR2</a> (which you can also use on a PC with the right adapter, I might add). You can also pick up a new DualSense controller for $20 off, or for $30 off of the more premium (and very good) DualSense Edge gamepad.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">$100 USD off PlayStation VR2</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off PlayStation Portal remote player</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off Pulse Elite wireless headset</li> <li aria-level="1">$30 USD off Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</li> <li aria-level="1">$30 USD off DualSense Edge wireless controller</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off DualSense wireless controller</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off Access controller</li> <li aria-level="1">Various discounts on PS5 games such as <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>, and <em>God of War Ragnarök</em></li> </ul> <p>Speaking for myself, my current controller is starting to show signs of drift, so I’m likely eyeing a new controller anyway. That or I’m gonna get creative with a soldering iron (which might end up being a wildly more expensive indulgence).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! The time is [Redacted] and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of interesting news, shit you might care about, and [Redacted]. We hope you enjoy your visit and get to learn more about Valve’s newly revealed Steam Machines, <em>Roblox</em> face-scanning tech, [Redacted], and Shroud’s problems with the Game Awards. And remember, please don’t [Redacted] or you might [Redacted]. Have a great day!</p>  <p>Popular video game streamer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661">content creator Shroud</a> is a big fan of this year’s excellent extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders.</em> And he’s not, apparently, a fan of the Game Awards snubbing the game for its Game of the Year award.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-world-is-just-not-ready-for-ai-in-video-games-shroud-accuses-the-game-awards-of-being-rigged-following-arc-raiders-goty-snub">As reported by <em>IGN</em>,</a> in a recent Twitch stream, Shroud watched the Game Awards nominees being announced and, upon seeing that<em> Arc Raiders</em> wasn’t in the running for the big GOTY award, expressed disappointment, saying, “The world is just not ready for AI in video games, not yet. They’re just not ready. But, hey, at least they nominated it for something. I genuinely thought they wouldn’t nominate it for anything because they were scared to get backlash. But at least they nominated it for something, so that’s good.” He then stated: “Once again, another year, another rigged year. That’s crazy.” Even before the nominees were revealed, <a href="https://x.com/shroud/status/1990460220020240848">he was claiming the show might be rigged.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>It’s a bit odd to suggest the world isn’t ready for <em>Arc Raiders</em>, considering it’s one of the most-played games on Steam right now and has received heaps of critical praise. And there is zero evidence that the Game Awards this year or any previous year are rigged. The awards are voted on by a panel of members of the games media and influencers. <em>IGN </em>reports that later in the stream, &nbsp;Shroud expressed disappointment at the possibility of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> winning, asking “who the fuck is playing” the Switch 2 platformer.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> rolls out age verification via face scanning</strong></h2> <p>Prepare to have your face scanned before playing <em>Roblox</em>. The extremely popular online free-to-play game has started <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-begins-rolling-out-age-checks-using-facial-age-estimation-technology">rolling out a voluntary face-scanning system</a> that will be used to check a player’s age and limit the ability for kids and adults to communicate. For now, you won’t need to verify your age by scanning your face with the <em>Roblox</em> app to play experiences online, but certain chat features will be locked behind the new process. And next year, age verification via a face scan will be required globally for all players to access the game at all. The company promises that it will delete all images and videos “immediately after processing.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> balloons will be included in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645171"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645171">©Macy’s / Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p>Netflix’s hit animated movie <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>continues to take over the world. Two characters from the cartoon, Derpy Tiger and Sussie, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-20-anniversary-voldemort-better-book/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=691c910e43e91a00019ec3e1&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">will be featured in the annual parade’s 99th installment next week as large, colorful balloons</a>. I’ve still not seen the movie yet, so I don’t have much to add beyond the fact that the balloons look cool and oh god it’s almost Thanksgiving and I have done zero Christmas shopping or planning.</p>

 <h2><strong>Close to a decade after launch, Epic finally adds gifting to its store</strong></h2> <p>Seven years after launch, the Epic Game Store has finally added the ability to gift games to other players on the platform, a feature Valve’s Steam store has supported for years now. <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs">According to a blog post</a> about the new feature, players can now buy and send games directly to people on their Epic friends lists. Gifted games can only be sent to friends and they must not own the game already. If they decline it, you get a full refund.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam Machines are more powerful than 70 percent of PCs that use Steam</strong></h2> <p>Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine, a console-like PC device for your TV, is supposedly more powerful than the majority of computers using Steam in 2025. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/valve-says-the-steam-machine-is-better-than-what-70-percent-of-pc-gamers-have-at-home-a-convenient-reminder-that-not-all-gaming-pcs-are-monster-rigs/">That’s according to Valve, as spotted by <em>PC Gamer.</em></a> In a recent video from Tested, the channel talked to Valve engineers who explained that for most Steam users, the upcoming Steam Machine will be an upgrade.</p>

 <p>“Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey,” said Valve. “Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people’s home devices are at in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70 percent of what people have at home.”</p> <p>A good reminder that most people playing PC games aren’t running powerful rigs with cutting-edge tech, but are instead rocking budget builds with older, less powerful parts. So if the Steam Machine is priced smartly, it could be a big hit for those gamers looking to upgrade.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">Please stop cancelling Yoko Taro’s games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">And here are your Game Awards 2025 nominees</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941">Everybody is mad about <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> on Steam</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

                <p>The future for single-player games has been a question mark since the rise of multiplayer and live-service titles across the video game industry. But according to a newly released survey from Ampere Analysis, single-player games remain the preference for 56% of gamers.</p><p>Ampere has shared the results of its survey, which had responses from 34,000 players across 22 different markets around the world. The new findings note that interest in single-player games has increased 4% over the last four years, and that there's only a small percentage of women (58%) who favor those titles over men (56%) who share their preferences.</p><p>One of the key findings from this survey suggests that fan interest in single-player games increases with age. Only 49% of younger players between 16-24 preferred single-player, while 64% of gamers age 55-64 favored it. Among gamers 25-34, single-player games were preferred by 56%.</p><p>The report notes that the US has the highest share of gamers who prefer single-player titles with 65%. However, Chinese gamers reportedly have the least interest in single-player games, with only 47% of players saying that they prefer those titles.</p><p>"This data reaffirms that single-player games are absolutely still viable--and sought-after--in the live-service-dominated landscape," said Ampere's senior research manager Louise Wooldridge. "The market favors multiplayer games for their ongoing engagement and monetization, but cracking a finely balanced formula for single-player games can leverage this broad audience appeal. Although most gamers prefer this content to multiplayer experiences, the friendship circle still plays a significant role in game discovery and uptake."</p><p>In recent years, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">canceled a Last of Us multiplayer title</a> to focus on single-player games like the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ceo-weighs-in-on-the-single-player-games-are-dead-argument/1100-6530174/" data-ref-id="1100-6530174">forcefully pushed back</a> on the notion that single-player titles are dead.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> proudly displays its influences, and the resemblance to games like Persona is clear across multiple aspects. One of them is the school side of things--it's in the name, after all. While most of your time in Demonschool will be spent, well, fighting demons and figuring out how to stop the apocalypse, you still have to hit the books.</p><p>At the very end of each in-game week, you'll be tasked with answering a quiz back at the classroom. In a similar fashion to activities like karaoke, you'll have to pick an answer within a timer. These, of course, are graded at the end--answer everything correctly and you'll be rewarded with relationship points on occasion, as well as moons, the currency used to obtain abilities. (They don't seem to have an official name, so I'll just call them moons.)</p><p>There's a total of ten exams--the main story continues afterward, but there's a clear cut-off point at the end of week 1. Without further ado, you can find all Demonschool quiz answers below, listed by each corresponding week.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_7">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 7</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_6">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 6</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_5">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 5</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_4">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 4</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_3">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 3</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_2">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 2</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_1">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 1</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</h2><ul><li>What is my name? - Thomas Vincent</li><li>Do the island and school have the same name? - Yes, they do</li><li>So what in fact is the island's name? - Hemsk</li><li>How many members are needed to form a club? - Four</li><li>Who is the school's dean? - Asatiani</li><li>If you fail in school, where do you go? - Prison</li></ul><p>Your reward is six moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</h2><ul><li>What happens when two demon hunters attack simultaneously? - A combo</li><li>Does every demon hunter have their own special attack? - Yes</li><li>When a demon hunter makes a slight adjustment left or right, what is that called? - Sidestep</li><li>What elements are all demons weak to? - Almighty</li></ul><p>Your reward is four moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</h2><ul><li>Who runs the island? - Dean Asatiani</li><li>What's the name of the alley shopkeep? - Triops</li><li>Who saved the island from invaders 100 years ago?
