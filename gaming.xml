            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/use-the-uchigatana-in-your-new-elden-ring-build-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If your <strong>Elden Ring</strong> build revolves around the Samurai class and move set, chances are you want to track down and equip a second Uchigatana. Even if you’re not playing Samura, knowing where to find the Uchigatana in Elden Ring proves worthwhile, as it is a durable, quick weapon that scales with Strength and Dexterity.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-uchigatana-in-elden-ring"><strong>Where is the Uchigatana in Elden Ring?</strong></h2>



<p>You can find the Uchigatana one of two ways, either as starting equipment for the Samurai class, as previously mentioned, or out in the world via a dungeon.</p>



<p>For the latter, <strong>you’ll find the Uchigatana in Deathtouched Catacombs</strong>, in Stormhill, Limgrave, where you’ll have to defeat a few skeletons and activate a lever to unlock the door leading into the hall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Within the catacombs, fight through the undead until you discover a dead body handing over the edge of the floor. It’s here that you’ll find the Uchigatana.</p>







<h2><strong>How Good is the Uchigatana?</strong></h2>



<p>The Uchigatana in <em>Elden Ring</em> is one of the best early-game weapons, as it is viable for both Piercing and Slash Damage. Furthermore, its Weapon Skill, <strong>Unsheathe</strong>, can help you down most bosses with relative ease early on.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you can <strong>upgrade the Uchigatana using Smithing Stones</strong>, which makes it stronger overall. Over time, the blade will cause bleed buildup, which is ever-useful when dealing with bosses with an increased health pool.</p>



<p>And yes, you can infuse the Uchigatana with <strong>Ashes of War</strong>. These include the likes of Sword Dance, Vacuum Slice, Bloodhound’s Step, Raptor of the Mists, Lighting Slash, Flame of the Redmanes, Carian Grandeur, Bloody Slash, and Seppuku, among countless others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legless-in-london-brings-accessible-victorian-ambition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new board game is bringing more visibility to the disabled community. Focus Games has partnered with an accomplished humanities professor to produce <em>Legless in London</em>, a board game about playing as an amputee in Victorian London.</p>

<h2>The <em>Legless in London</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's <a href="https://www.leglessinlondon.com/" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Legless in London</em> is a nuanced board game about disability.</p>

<p>It is a game where players face challenges, opportunities, and choices at every turn. They will navigate the workplace, the marriage market, property ownership, medicine, and the prosthesis market while aiming to achieve their character's personal goals.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=KiLoYxbx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=G8FuaE5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The playable characters in Legless in London are all inspired by Victorian amputees and fictional characters from 19th-century literature. Everyone from beloved poet William Ernest Henley to <em>Moby Dick's</em> Captain Ahab are represented here.</p>

<p>In addition to being designed for fun, Legless in London encourages players to think about the various barriers that disabled people face in real life and the different hurdles they confront. Furthermore, the designers hope players will reflect on how disabled people are represented in fiction and popular culture.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> was designed in collaboration with Focus Games and Dr. Ryan Sweet, a Senior Lecturer in Humanities at Swansea University, alongside a focus group of members of the disabled community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disability and disability history are underrepresented in culture—and especially in tabletop gaming. Many mainstream tabletop games also present accessibility problems for disabled players (for example, wordy and/or complex rules, which can be troublesome for neurodivergent users). Legless in London addresses both representational and accessibility concerns as it provides a balanced, researched-informed, positive, and fun portrayal of disability in an inclusive format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That consideration for disability also extends to the game's design. It will launch with a smartphone app, providing a digital alternative to the game's physical components including dice rolls, event cards, health tracker, and in-game money.</p>

<p>As for the physical components, the game will ship with large accessible font text, screen reader-friendly resources, easy-read rules, and more.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> will launch in February 2025.</p>

			<p>Many great platformers were released this year, but one in particular stole the show. This list will compile some of the greatest platforming games released this year if you want a game that's fun for all the family or seek to introduce someone to gaming. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five best platformers of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Astro Bot (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/">9.3/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's no surprise that Astro Bot is on top. The game was well-received by critics and users across the globe, and many got to go on a journey of nostalgia and celebrate Sony's expansive lineage. Compared to Astro's Playroom, Astro Bot is a fully thought-out game where you get to jump, climb, glide, and fly across expansive levels while saving bots that are cameos from Sony's iconic games. Below is an excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's review.</p>
<p><em>Everything that Astro Bot touches is filled with whimsy and amusement. The titular hero’s every animation is tinged with a sickeningly sweet charisma, from the way he carries himself throughout the stage on his own two feet or floating through the air via his high-tech jet back, going a few rounds to knock out rogue bots, and the idle animations that are unique to each level. All of the backdrop and tertiary characters of Astro Bot similarly share that wonder and charm and even the simple interactions between one mascot bot to another would never fail to put a smile on my face.&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h2>
<p>For fans of the Sonic franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> was a dream come true. Although fans initially thought it was going just to be a simple remaster, it is evident that the game is much more than that and provides more content than players expected. Not only did the graphics receive a massive boost and give more detail than ever to both Sonic and Shadow, but it seems that a bit of Sonic Frontiers rubbed off on the game, too.</p>
<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations is a great title if you want to introduce your children to gaming or get them to love the Sonic franchise, too. There may be some difficult moments, but you can always step in and complete the boss fight for them if they're struggling a lot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Mario vs. Donkey Kong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-vs-donkey-kong/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It isn't all that shocking that a Nintendo game has made it into one of the top spots for best Platformer of 2024. If there's one thing that Nintendo does best, it's this genre. Mario vs Donkey Kong was released in February this year.</p>
<p>For those who played the original, this may serve as a sweet hit of nostalgia. For those new to the game, it's still a fun time all around. This game has plenty of value for money, too, as you can play through over 130 levels, experiencing the classic platformer in a new light. Here's what Nathan Birch said in Wccftech's review:</p>
<p><em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong may lack the razzle dazzle of its stars’ more recent games, but this remake still has the power to hook players with its tried-and-true retro platforming and a finely-tuned difficulty curve that culminates in some challenges that will truly test your mind and reflexes. Those who have played the original Mario vs. DK to death may not find quite enough new content here, but lapsed fans and new players are in for a barrel of fun.</em></p>
<h2>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey was a fantastic game that was first released in 2010 on the Nintendo Wii. Fast forward 14 years, and we have now experienced the remastered release of Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. It's a fantastic game and a great way to introduce youngsters to gaming. It takes you on a journey through Disney's forgotten history while you get to wield a paintbrush to help you traverse the terrain, as well as utilize your paintbrush to take on bosses in the world.</p>
<p>For what it is, the game is a pretty great remaster of a Disney classic title and will provide a lot of nostalgia for those who played and loved the original. Some systems were improved, while others fell behind a little bit. While it is a fantastic game, it's undoubtedly no Astro Bot and does have some flaws that may make the game a bit tiresome after a while.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>The Plucky Squire (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-plucky-squire-a-zelda-love-letter/">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Plucky Squire is the perfect game if you want to introduce young children to gaming. While some of the mechanics may seem a little bit complicated at first, it's very easy to get the hang of and really accessible. When it comes to platformers that were released this year, The Plucky Squire is incredibly unique in the way it tackles traversal and movement through the game.</p>
<p>It's more than just a platformer, though, as there's also fun combat to engage in, a storyline to experience, and lots of collectibles to discover as you solve puzzles. The game is a lot of fun and great for anyone of any age.</p>

<p>SNK has announced the creation of a knew studio for its fighting games called KOF Studio. KOF Studios’ role will be to help “further evolve the SNK fighting game IP”.</p>



<p>The move comes alongside the 30th anniversary of the studio’s The King of Fighters franchise.</p>



<p>“Since their creation in the 1990s,&nbsp;fighting game series such as&nbsp;“Garou Densetsu”, “Samurai Shodown”, and “The King of Fighters”&nbsp;have been loved by fans around the world,” SNK <a href="https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/kofstudio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in its announcement</a> via translation.</p>



<p>Currently, SNK has a number of games in development within the aforementioned franchises. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is scheduled for release in April 2025, and will be the first release for the series since Fatal Fury: First Contact in 1999. There’s also a new action RPG Samurai Shodown game in early development.</p>



<p>The King of Fighters’ last game launched in 2022. There’s been no mention on when the next game in the series could be coming.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">From the first trailer, I knew Neva would be an emotional experience. Nomada Studio's previous game, Gris, was a poignant exploration of grief and the effects it can have on a person, told through the lens of a young girl who'd just lost her mother. Neva explores familial bonds through a different but just as emotional lens: parenthood.</p><p dir="ltr">The relationship between Alba and Neva mirrors a mother/child relationship through most of the game. The wolf starts as a small cub, curious about the world and ready to explore, and eventually he becomes a strong protector, equaling his mother's capabilities. From there, the two fight against the blight that's affecting the world, with Neva learning new abilities in every season.</p><p dir="ltr">The journey encompassing this coming of age includes some of the strongest voice acting you'll find in a video game this year. However, unlike games like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor: ReFantazio, which are bursting with dialogue, Neva accomplishes this feat with a much smaller script; throughout the entire five-hour adventure, only one word is ever spoken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415496" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415496"></a><figcaption>One of many gorgeous scenes throughout Neva.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Neva's control scheme is standard fare for an action-platformer: one button to attack, one button to jump, one button to dodge, etc. Included in the control scheme, though, is a button specifically designated for calling Neva. No matter what you're doing, or where you are, a simple press will make Alba say "Neva" and call out for the good wolfie girl.</p><p dir="ltr">While the mechanic has its uses--you can call Neva to your side if she's far away, or instruct her to jump up a ledge--it's mostly just there for the player's enjoyment. Calling Neva usually results in Alba giving her companion a little scratch behind the ears--which means yes, in Neva, you can pet the dog.</p><p dir="ltr">Its biggest contribution to the story, and what sends Neva into the upper echelon of 2024 voice acting, is the emotion Alba conveys whenever the button is pressed. When there's little danger around, and Neva is sniffing around or standing still, Alba's voice is calm, loving, and light. The character's love for her companion comes through, especially when it's followed by sounds of delight from both characters following a loving head scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">Press that button in a more urgent moment, however, and Alba's voice becomes <em>much </em>heavier. There's urgency in her calls, permeated by a sense of panic. Her anxiety and fear come to the surface, and all it takes is a change in inflection. It's powerful stuff, and it makes using the call button more than worth it even in hectic situations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415498" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415498"></a><figcaption>Neva is trapped, and Alba fights to free her companion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's one moment in particular that really highlights how effective this voice acting can be. Alba and Neva are separated, and the player as Alba must traverse a perilous maze in order to reunite with the wolf. Throughout this endeavor, pressing the call button makes Alba utter a cry of pure terror, helplessly shouting into the void in search of her lost companion. The fear of the unknown is palpable, and I start to feel Alba's anxiety with her as I hear her call the wolf's name.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, putting Alba's ability to call out for Neva on a button is not without its pitfalls. By doing this, Nomada ran the risk of some players not being able to hear the exceptional voice work at hand, simply because they were so focused on the action on screen that they were too busy attacking and dodging to press the call button.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Nomada brilliantly trained us to keep it in the back of our minds through the mechanic I mentioned earlier: the one where Alba uses her call to summon Neva to her side. The player now knows that calling Neva can summon her, so once the two are separated, it's natural to press the button and see if it works--and when it doesn't, to keep trying it in the hopes that maybe it will work eventually.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who's ever been in care of a child and lost sight of them--be it in a store, a theme park, or even in their own homes--can relate to this feeling of paralyzing fear, uncertainty, and doubt… as well as the feeling of sheer relief when Alba finds Neva happily sitting on a platform, not a care in the world, as if nothing happened. Kids these days!</p><p dir="ltr">Neva is a profound analysis of parenthood, and all of the highs and lows that come with it. The raw emotion is best conveyed through its voice acting, credited to Cristina Peña, and putting Alba's voice under the player's control makes it that much more effective. Nomada Studio deserves a ton of credit for finding a way to convey the intricate complexities of being a caregiver--and even more credit for doing it with a single word.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

Top-ranked former world champion Magnus Carlsen recently showed up to a tournament in jeans, refused to change, got fined, and then threatened to back out of the event altogether. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) then proceeded to blink first.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The drama kicked off on December 27 when Carlsen showed up to the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York wearing denim instead of slacks. FIDE said the chess world all-star was in violation of the event’s dress code and hit him with a $200 fine. When Carlsen refused to go pick up dress pants from the TJ Maxx just a block away from the Cipriani Wall Street venue, the federation upped the ante and removed the champion from his 9th round matchups.</p><p>Carlsen then called the federation’s bluff by saying he would back out altogether, ditching the Blitz Chess Championships in which he was set to defend his current title. The federation responded with a lengthy blog post announcing possible exceptions to the dress code to be made at the judges’ discretion. </p><p>“The principle is simple: it is still required to follow the official dress-code, but elegant minor deviations (that may, in particular, include appropriate jeans matching the jacket) are allowed,” the December 29 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fide.com/news/3366&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fide.com/news/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement read</a></span>. “In the end, it is New Year time, and I sincerely hope that nobody would try to undermine the festive mood, including by abusing this additional flexibility.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview directly after the incident</a></span>, Carlsen said that he had come to the event from a meeting and hadn’t had time to change. He added that while he had offered to change for the matches the following day, that wasn’t enough for the federation. “I’ll probably head off to somewhere where the weather is a bit nicer than here,” he quipped. But now that FIDE has backed off of its “draconian” decision, Carlsen is once again set to appear in the Blitz side of the tournament. </p><p>The five-time world champion wasn’t the only one dinged over his attire. Eighth-ranked Ian Nepomniachtchi was also fined by FIDE for wearing “sport shoes.” But Carlsen’s protest certainly made for more drama. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477">Hans Neimann</a></span>, who Carlsen previously accused of cheating in chess’ now-infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639">“anal beads” scandal</a></span>, said the champion had manufactured the jeans fiasco on purpose. </p><p>“Allowing a single actor to make a mockery of the tournament and then bending the knee is disappointing,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>. “FIDE has a responsibility to protect the sanctity of the game.

<p>Stardew Valley has hit another sales milestone. According to the game’s developer ConcernedApe, the game has sold over 41 million copies as of December 2024.</p>



<p>That total puts it roughly 11 million more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-30-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “over 30 million”</a> it surpassed earlier 2024. According to the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, 26 million of the 41 million copies have been sold on PC while another 7.9 million were sold on Nintendo Switch. </p>

The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-stardew-valley-console-update-is-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last major update</a> — 1.6 — saw new festivals and events added along with hundreds of other changes.</p>



<p>In addition to game updates, the game continues to hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-hits-all-time-player-count-eight-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new player count records</a>. Even the music has found its place in the hearts of players with <a href="https://www.stardewvalleyconcert.com/news/new-tour-announcement-sos-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a full orchestra tour</a> performing the game’s soundtrack. Lastly, a recent study found that Stardew Valley was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-best-game-reducing-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best game for reducing stress</a>.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/135-december-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">December community update</a>, Focus first looks at the last few months for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, highlighting things like major updates and the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow">rather impressive sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 recap, Focus then moves onto highlighting what you can expect from next year in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and the first thing on the agenda is more PvP content. The publisher says it knows PvP fans feel "left out", and so next year will bring a new map, custom lobbies, and more.</p>

New Operations and enemies are also on the way for you to tackle.</p>

<p>We also got a look at the next champion making his way to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and it's a Salamander sniper. Focus acknowledges that the Raven Guard Chapter would have been "an obvious choice" for a sniper, but that the studio has "different plans" for the Raven Guard.</p>

<p>More customization options are also coming, alongside a new Datavault option on the Battle Barge. It'll allow you to read "unlockable information on most elements from the game", in case you want to brush up on your&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, it's a third-person shooter set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>The game sees protagonist Demetrian Titus returning from the first game. Having spent time with the Deathwatch in order to prove himself free of heresy, Titus is re-inducted into the Ultramarines and tasked with eradicating a Tyrannid infestation on the planet Kadaku.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes both close-quarters combat and ranged weaponry, and it's also got a renewed focus on co-op play. Fittingly enough, its credits also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit" rel="nofollow">feature a rather touching tribute</a> to a man who championed the original title.</p>

An example would be an item you can buy that makes your character more powerful than that of someone who didn’t cough up real money. However, some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>fans are throwing the derogatory label onto the hero shooter because of a bug that’s giving some users an unexpected advantage in fights. While you could argue that this situation has folks throwing around the phrase “pay to win” a little too liberally, the bug in question is certainly one that should be addressed by developer NetEase.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,195859,196032" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have realized that when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-concord-best-hero-shooters-1851726774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-concord-best-hero-shooters-1851726774"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is running at lower framerates, some hero abilities do less damage or are generally less efficient than they are at higher framerates. In other words, if you’re playing the shooter on a high-end PC that can run the game at a higher framerate, you’ll find your enemies will take more damage from certain attacks than they would if you were playing on a machine that runs the game at a lower framerate. Other idiosyncrasies include certain attacks executing more quickly, or seemingly losing range at lower framerates. The reason some fans are calling this “pay to win” is because if you can afford a beefier PC, you can circumvent the issue entirely.</p><p>Currently, this bug is known to impact five characters: Star-Lord, Wolverine, Doctor Strange, Magik, and Spider-Man. At the moment, this is a bigger problem for players on PC than on console, as those all play at the same framerate across the board. However, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is crossplay, which means you could be teamed up with a PC player affected by this, so it’s a problem for everyone until it’s fixed.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>has received a few patches that have primarily focused on bug fixes, so that seems to be top of mind for the team. Now that this issue has been discovered, hopefully NetEase will be looking into a fix.
