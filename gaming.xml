            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Believe it or not, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is almost upon us. That <strong>4th December</strong> release date is Morph Balling ever closer, and today, we've got our latest round of hands-on previews to give us a taste of what we can expect.</p>
<p>Our very own video producer extraordinaire, Alex Olney, was lucky enough to attend an extended preview event for Samus' latest adventure, and it sounds like he had a jolly good time. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">preview</a>, Alex sings the praises of the game's fun new psychic abilities and gorgeous environments, though one of the new Galactic Troopers firmly got on his nerves.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from the full hands-on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest and most important parts of the Prime series (and the Metroid series as a whole) is the feeling of isolation, loneliness, and that you’re being forced to fight against the environment that doesn’t want you there to begin with. That notion is entirely destroyed once you introduce a character that blathers away at you incessantly, and it'll be a crying shame if this is something that is present throughout the full game’s runtime</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:193706 @ 1763136004 -->
<p>But Mr. Olney wasn't the only one to share his preliminary thoughts on the game today; quite the opposite, in fact! Other outlets have also had the chance to play through an early section of the game, and we've assembled the following round-up to see what a selection of them made of it.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-delivers-the-series-trademark-gameplay-in-spades-but-i-fear-one-very-annoying-addition-might-derail-the-whole-thing">Eurogamer</a>, where the outlet's preview mirrored many of the same concerns as ours: the game looks and plays wonderfully, but gosh, that Trooper is annoying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed the puzzles, the shooting, and very much appreciated the game's control options and visual flair. A huge amount of trepidation about Metroid's usually glorious atmosphere being wrecked now runs through that anticipation, though, like lettering through a stick of seaside rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things went much the same way in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview">IGN</a>'s preview, too, where the gorgeous environments and classic puzzles were overshadowed by a chatty companion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classic Metroid Prime exploration and combat, an intriguing setup, gorgeous art direction, and great technical performance on Switch 2 are coming together to create an adventure that likely won’t redefine Metroid in any meaningful way – or live up to the unrealistic hype built by nearly a decade of waiting – but one that could serve as a great return for a subseries that hasn’t seen a new mainline entry in 18 years, as long as annoying sidekicks don’t keep getting in Samus’ way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/so-far-metroid-prime-4-doesnt-feel-like-metroid-at-all/">VGC</a>'s worries about these features ran even deeper, with the outlet's preview cautiously warning that the opening section "didn’t feel much like Metroid at all":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Metroid Prime 4 is seemingly trying to be is a far less interesting, and more dated, type of first-person action game with none of the mood the series is known for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not all doom and gloom, mind you. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-samuss-psychic-abilities-are-more-than-a-gimmick/1100-6536193/">GameSpot</a> didn't find Myles MacKenzie nearly as annoying as other outlets, even going as far as to call him "endearing", and instead focused much of the preview on Samus' cool new psychic powers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo and Retro Studios appear to understand the fundamental core of what makes a Metroid Prime game, with satisfying exploration, tense combat puzzles, and meaningful new abilities that change how you look at the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/after-18-years-metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-a-surprisingly-magical-return-to-nintendos-legendary-series-and-im-all-in-on-psychic-abilities-and-the-power-of-friendship/">GamesRadar+</a> felt a similar way, it seems, writing that Samus' companions and abilities might make for a nice surprise in the long run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond demo I played, then, suggests an unexpected direction for the Metroid Prime series – possibly more whimsy than isolation. It's nothing like what I expected. But with the demanding life Samus has lived, I'm glad for all the butterflies she can get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrapping things up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-preview-switch-2/">Polygon</a>'s preview remains optimistic, noting how, despite the new features, the game still feels distinctly <em>Metroid</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is not just a rehash of Retro’s original run. It’s a tonal divergence, a bit sillier in places, a bit more gruesome in others. But <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> still plays the series’ greatest hits.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-would-like-to-bring-horizon-steel-frontiers-to-ps5-say-it-cant-make-that-call-on-its-own/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">NCSoft and Guerrilla Games revealed the long-anticipated MMO</a> set within Sony's Horizon universe, Horizon Steel Frontiers, and it looked like just about everything you might've expected from a Horizon MMO, which is to say that it looks like it'll be extremely fun and exciting to play. But, surprisingly, the reveal carried one glaring omission: it's not coming to PS5; it'll only launch on PC and mobile.</p>



<p>Why a new game made in collaboration with one of Sony's first-party PlayStation Studios, based on a Sony-owned, first-party IP, is not coming to Sony's flagship console is the million-dollar question surrounding Horizon Steel Frontiers, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-steel-frontier-developer-wants-playstation-release-but-its-not-something-we-can-decide-on-our-own">Eurogamer</a>), we get a bit of insight into the answer behind that million-dollar question.</p>



<p>According to NCSoft executive producer Lee Song, the studio has no problem bringing Horizon Steel Frontiers to PS5. In fact, it wants to deliver the game on PS5. So why wasn't PS5 one of the listed platforms when it was revealed? Well, it appears we'll have to ask Sony.</p>



<p>NCSoft has "<em>no reason</em>," Song said, not to bring the game to PS5. "<em>We would like to do it,</em>" he added, "<em>but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions</em>."</p>



<p>So if NCSoft is gun-ho to bring Horizon Steel Frontiers to PlayStation consoles, the remaining conclusion is that Sony is, for reasons unknown, blocking the game from its flagship console. </p>



<p>Perhaps it will eventually come to PS5, but Sony wants it to launch elsewhere as part of its plans to expand its reach outside of the PlayStation ecosystem on other platforms. Perhaps it figures that there's already a fan base of Horizon fans who will play Steel Frontiers on PS5 whenever it arrives on the console, but it would prefer to try and build a base of players on mobile and PC first, before going to the players it knows will buy into Steel Frontiers whenever it arrives on PlayStation.</p>



<p>Or perhaps Sony doesn't want Steel Frontiers on PlayStation at all, to keep a differentiating line between the experiences it delivers to console and the ones it'll bring to PC and mobile. All we can do is speculate, until Sony provides an answer, if it ever does. But at least we know who to ask.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-amd-ryzen-7-gaming-mini-pc-is-back-to-its-all-time-low-stock-is-being-cleared-before-black-friday-hits.1353877/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini PCs offer a third option from laptops and desktop PCs if you’re looking to run Windows without spending too much cash. They work brilliantly as dedicated work stations, supplemental devices to your other devices to get work done, or as your main device if you don’t want to take up too much space. They even make for handy little gaming units. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/">This GMKtec mini gaming PC happens to be on sale right now too. Amazon has the GMKtec K12 Gaming Mini PC discounted by 31% ahead of Black Friday.</a> For a limited time, you can grab this mini gaming PC for $220 off, bringing the price down from $720 to just $500.</p>
<p>As the name of the product category implies, a mini PC takes up substantially less room than a standard PC would. Heck, you can even reduce it’s footprint to zero by mounting it to the back of your display or monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>Taking a peak into the specs, The GMKtec mini PC is working with a Ryzen 7 H 255 processor. That has eight cores and 16 threads, an can run at up to 4.9 GHz. Paired with the powerful Radeon 780M iGPU, you can even get some decent gaming done with this hardware. The K12 mini PC is equipped with dual 16GB RAM, totaling to 32GB. It comes with a 512GB SSD but three SSD slots are available, each capable of reading up to 8TB for a max of 24TB. You get both Wi-Fi 6E support and Bluetooth 5.2 support built in.</p>
<p>The OCuLink port can take your gaming even further. You can actually plug into a beefier graphics card externally to get the gaming boost you’re looking for. Just know the mini PC doesn’t support hotswapping it. You’ll need to turn off the power first before plugging to or unplugging from a graphics card connection.</p>



<p>The base hardware is still pretty powerful, able to display in resolutions up to 8K if you need. It allows for connecting to up to four screens at once. The HDMI 2.1 will grant you up to 8K at 60Hz, the DisplayPort will grant you up to 4K at 60Hz, and the two USB-C can be used for display, though the product page doesn’t specs for those two.</p>
<p>Dual cooling fans help keep the rig from overheating. The two can deliver silent, ultra-efficient cooling at just 35dB. Plus the fans have cool lighting. Wouldn’t be a gaming PC without cool lighting.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-call-of-duty-black-ops-7%E2%80%B2s-campaign-is-multiplayer-only-and-doesn%E2%80%99t-let-you-pause.1353874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a massive departure from the series norm, the campaign in the newly released <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </i>is an online co-op experience from start to finish. Not only is the campaign always online, but as if it thought it was <i>Elden Ring</i>, you can’t pause it, and you’ll get booted for idling.</p> <p>Maybe it’s secretly an experimental art project on the nature of entropy.</p> <p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> comes out today with a full campaign and multiplayer mode. The campaign, it seems, goes all in on co-op play. The <i>option </i>to play campaigns in co-op is usually a welcome one but here, co-op is so inherent to the experience that it’s making solo play really hard, with a lack of checkpoints and an expectation that you’re always online and never AFK (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-is-online-only-with-no-checkpoints-or-pausing-and-will-kick-you-if-youre-idle-for-too-long">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>).</p>

 <p>Apparently, trying to complete this campaign on your own ramps up the tedium, with you having to do things like repeat objectives scattered around an environment–such as placing explosives in certain spots–that were clearly designed to be handled by multiple players all working together.</p>

 <p>It’s an unfortunate situation for those who enjoy a straightforward, linear solo campaign with objectives that feel designed to accommodate solo play. Maybe go back and play 2022’s <i>Modern Warfare II</i>? It was kind of a snoozefest in some ways, but hey, at least you wouldn’t get kicked for idling.</p> <p>It kind of reminds me of that one time me and two friends of mine managed to somehow make it through a <i>Destiny </i>raid without the extra three players by running around like crazy people to accomplish certain objectives that were clearly made with more people in mind. It felt like we were getting away with something we shouldn’t’ve been. Maybe tackling <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s campaign solo at least offers some of these transgressive thrills?</p>

              <p>The announcement of a new&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> game would usually be something that came with a great deal of fanfare and publicity, which makes the strange, quiet appearance of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> quite peculiar. This mobile project, which is apparently a collab between <em>Minecraft</em> developers Mojang and&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush</em> creators King, has only come to anyone’s attention after it appeared on the Apple store for people in Malaysia. Huh.</p> <p>When Microsoft so controversially bought Activision in 2023, understandably most of our attention was on how this seemingly monopolistic move meant the Windows and Xbox owner now controlled everything from <em>Call of Duty</em> to <em>World of Warcraft</em>. But less focused on was the simultaneous acquisition of King, which Activision Blizzard had previously bought for $5.9 billion. That’s now suddenly being brought into the light with the sudden announcement of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em>, a match-3 game in the manner of King’s mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga</em>, but based around the blocky world of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

 <p>Oh yes, because as hard as we might try to forget, Microsoft owns <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>too, after that 2014 purchase for $2.5 billion. And if I’m a besuited Microsoft exec, and I’m looking at the miniature model on my table of all the empires I own, at a certain point I’m definitely going to want to see if there’s money in combining them together.</p>

 <p>The result on this occasion is a free-to-play matching puzzle game set in <em>Minecraft</em>‘s world with <em>Minecraft</em>‘s art and tools. You have a sort of 3D mini-world in which you can craft, but to get the “energy” to do this you need to play the block-tapping 2D puzzle game. Here you tap matching groups of colored blocks to break those around them, revealing TNT and fireworks and so on as you attempt to clear a level. Although, not having played it myself and given the scant information <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft-blast">on the game’s site</a>, it’s hard to provide you with much clearer guidance.</p>

 <p>You might imagine a video of someone playing the game would be more informative, but&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> YouTuber PatarHD’s footage is so frustratingly edited and so painfully scripted that it feels like the world’s most confusing ad.</p>  <p><em>Minecraft Blast</em> is currently being playtested in Malaysia alone, and apparently this test will only last for a week or two. But Microsoft promises more locations and longer tests will be coming soon, stating that right now it is in “extremely early days with this project,” and that it plans “to start rolling out small, limited-run tests in select markets to help us gather early feedback and involve our community from the start.”</p>

 <p>However, in the YouTube video above, PatarHD claims that if you have an iOS device, you can just change your region to Malaysia and download the app now.</p> <p>It looks like the full version of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> is still a fair way off. Although given it’s F2P, perhaps we can enjoy the wait.</p>

<p>An insider has revealed that the arrival of Red Dead Redemption on current-gen consoles doesn’t mean that Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version will not be coming. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rockstar Games came with some massive announcements about Red Dead Redemption yesterday. It was revealed that the game will not only be available for current-gen consoles as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-owners-on-last-gen-consoles-are-eligible-for-free-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free upgrade</a>, but will also be playable on iOS and Android devices through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-new-announcements-do-not-negate-rdr2-from-happening">The New Announcements Do Not Negate RDR2 From Happening </h2>



<p>Reliable insider NateTheHate was recently told on <a href="https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1989053149097976264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they should change their insider sources, as they didn’t predict the announcement of Red Dead Redemption’s current-gen port. However, NateTheHate responded to this post, stating that this announcement “doesn’t negate” the fact that Red Dead Redemption 2 is also receiving the current-gen upgrade. </p>



<p>When asked about what he knows regarding the release window for Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version, Nate revealed that he was told it should arrive “a few months after” the release of the Nintendo Switch 2. This was the information he had since the beginning of this year, but since then, GTA 6 has been delayed, and Rockstar is known for doing “whatever they want”. Hence, the release timelines for these games are always subject to change. </p>







<p>In other news, Red Dead Redemption 2 recently became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-become-the-fourth-best-selling-game-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth best-selling game ever</a>, surpassing Mario Kart 8 in units sold. Additionally, more enhanced version <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-claims-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims surfaced online</a> as the anniversary drew close.

                <p>It's a been a long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, but the return of bounty hunter Samus Aran is just a few weeks away. Now, Nintendo has dropped an extended trailer for Metroid Prime 4 that sets up the story, shows off her new powers, and reveals that she does have allies on the planet Viewros. What she doesn't have is a way to get off the hostile world that's trying to kill her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mBR0H1F5hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mBR0H1F5hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the opening minutes of the trailer, Samus answers a distress call from a Galactic Federation research center that comes under attack by her rival, Sylux. During the battle, Samus is somehow transported to an unknown and hostile world called Viewros. And some of the Galactic Federation troops survived to make the trip as well. But without a ship, this may be a one-way journey for Samus and her allies.</p><p>Samus' standard abilities are back in this game, and she picks up a few new skills including psychic powers that can direct her shots with precision or operate the long-abandoned machinery on Viewros. GameSpot recently had a chance to try out those psychic powers during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-samuss-psychic-abilities-are-more-than-a-gimmick/1100-6536193/" data-ref-id="1100-6536193">a hands-on experience with Metroid Prime 4</a>. </p><p>There are several different biomes on the planet, abandoned factories, and an open-world desert that Samus can travel across on her motorcycle, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">the Vi-0-La</a>. Samus can even summon the Vi-0-La while exploring the various factories, and the game shifts from first-person to third-person in these scenes.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4 will be available on both Switch and Switch 2 on December 4, but only the latter has mouse controls on the Joy-Con 2 that can give Samus even greater control of her aim. The video demonstrates how players can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">swap from standard to mouse controls</a> at will.</p>

                <p>After getting leaked earlier this week, Epic Games has revealed that Grammy-winning artist Tyler, the Creator will join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> on November 14 as an purchasable skin.</p><p>The official Fortnite X account <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1989332670351102047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a seven-second teaser video</a> of the "Don't Tap the Glass" rapper's skin. In the clip, we get a look at two outfits for Tyler, the Creator: his green "Chromakopia" getup and an ensemble that closely resembles his "Wolf" or "Cherry Bomb" days.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/tyler-the-creator-fortnite-skin-leaked-all-cosmetics-outfits-prices-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 12 Vice story</a>, prolific dataminer NotPaloLeaks unveiled this Tyler, the Creator collaboration in an X post on November 11. As Vice speculates, his skins could cost 1,500 V-Bucks, and his arrival may come with cosmetics like weapon wraps, pickaxes, backpacks, jam tracks, and emotes. The official Fortnite X account hasn't confirmed this yet, but Tyler, the Creator hits the in-game shop on November 14, so it won't be much longer until everything is made clearer.</p><p>Regardless of what comes with Tyler, the Creator's arrival, the Fortnite community is losing its mind. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1owxaqw/the_wait_is_over_tylerthecreator_is_landing_in/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent post in r/FortniteBR about the reveal</a>, the comments are filled with excitement. "Pretty cool. Was hoping for Chromakopia," one Redditor said. "God yes," another user chimed.</p><p>The sentiment is about the same on X. In the replies to the teaser video, users expressed their enthusiasm for the skin. "Finally," <a href="https://x.com/G_BoysAccount/status/1989336309735841871" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one poster said with a Family Guy GIF</a>. "It's enough to make a grown man cry," <a href="https://x.com/AbrahamDia11852/status/1989333187290435877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied another</a>.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is pleased with the collab. Some in that r/FortniteBR post dismissed the skin. Meanwhile, users in the replies to Fortnite's X post were taken aback by his appearance, with one poster calling the skin "<a href="https://x.com/SrSonicCraft1/status/1989333226704249240" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tyron the Architect</a>" because of the face he makes when diving from the Battle Bus in the teaser video.</p><p>Tyler, the Creator joins Fortnite just as Springlefield continues taking over the battle royale shooter. The Simpsons have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">running all over Fortnite Island</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/son-of-a-diddly-ned-flanders-has-eliminated-33000-unneighborly-fortnite-players/1100-6536031/" data-ref-id="1100-6536031">Ned Flanders in particular piling up the bodies</a>. However, Fox's cartoon won't stick around for much longer; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-7-start-date-new-map-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6536068/" data-ref-id="1100-6536068">Season 7 is slated to start on November 29</a>, with Fortnite Island possibly taking on a distinctive LA flair and new collabs--from Kill Bill to SpongeBob SquarePants--hinted at joining the game.</p>

            <p>Indie Sims-like game Paralives has delayed its early access release following recent playtests that proved the game "isn't up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release".</p>
<p>Back in June, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-sims-like-paralives-launches-in-early-access-this-december">game was given an early access release date</a> of 8th December. Now, that release has shifted to 25th May 2026.</p>
<p>A lengthy statement from developer Alex Massé has detailed the reasons for the delay, as well as outlining the ambitious scope of the project.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to delay the release," it reads. "After thoughtful consideration, we feel it's best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December.</p>
<p>"In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn't up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release."</p>
<p>Specifically, Massé noted "impactful bugs" in the Live Mode and a "lack of activities to do in the town, which dampened the enjoyment of the players".</p>
<p>Massé plans for Paralives to be a "fresh and indie take on the doll-house life simulation genre", describing it as three games in one: an "advanced and flexible build mode", a "greatly customisable character creator", and a "complex life simulation mode". It seems the latter element is what requires more time.</p><p>"We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game," said Massé. "This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards."</p>

<p>In the meantime, a 45 minute stream will take place on 25th November to show off the current state of the game. The game's website also has a <a href="https://paralives.notion.site/f138c4f6cb234604be16fe4198d17f51?v=41e2b3e389404b37b4060bc74dead4af">detailed roadmap</a> of improvements and fixes ahead of the game's release. "This will ensure that more players will be happy with the state of the game at launch when comparing it to other great life simulation games that sparked everyone's love for the genre," said Massé.</p>
<p>Last year, the developer stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">Paralives wouldn't have paid DLC</a> but free expansions instead. "As a small team without any shareholders to please," it said, "we believe the money we make from selling the game alone will be enough to support us and the development of free updates in the long run."</p>

		<p>Paralives will not be entering early access this year as initially planned, with Paralives Studio announcing the decision to delay the release to May 25th, 2026. The delay comes after feedback from playtesters which convinced the development team the game is in a state to be sold yet, with issues including bugs in the live mode and a lack of activities for players to do in the game.</p>

<p>In a statement, Alex Massé, the lead developer of Paralives said, <em>“Unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to delay the release. We are truly sorry for the last-minute announcement. After thoughtful consideration, we feel it’s best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December. In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release. Players enjoy the flexibility and the customization of the Paramaker and Build Mode. However, there are still impactful bugs in the Live Mode and a lack of activities to do in the town, which dampened the enjoyment of the players, and we feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community.</em></p>
<p><em>I started this project wanting it to be a fresh and indie take on the doll-house life simulation genre, which had not been tackled by many game developers. I attribute this partly to the fact that a project like Paralives is a colossal task. Life sims are really 3 games in one: an advanced and flexible build mode, a greatly customizable character creator and a complex life simulation mode. Over the last 6 years of development, starting with 2-3 developers for the first years, to growing to an average team size of only 10 people, we had to alternate long stretches of development between these 3 parts of the game. We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game. This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards. The new Early Access release date is May 25, 2026. We have updated our detailed roadmap (paralives.com/roadmap) with what we will be improving over the coming months, with a focus on fixing important issues and improving the first-time user experience. This will ensure that more players will be happy with the state of the game at launch when comparing it to other great life simulation games that sparked everyone’s love for the genre.”</em></p>

<p>Paralives is a life simulation game that could challenge The Sims. It is one of the most followed games on Steam with over a million wishlists. In Paralives, players will be able to build their own homes, create characters, and develop bonds with the other characters that populate the world.</p>

      <div><p>Wizards of the Coast is expanding their partnership with TCGPlayer. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> publisher will work alongside the virtual card marketplace for exclusive content designed to engage the dedicated enthusiast community.</p>



<p>According to the press release, Wizards of the Coast's TCGPlayer partnership is expanding from something offered earlier this year: the introduction of WPN badges to eligible TCGPlayer storefronts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tcgplayer-promo-logo.jpg?itok=ObQXZVMF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tcgplayer-promo-logo.jpg?itok=zzRzTYZO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now, Wizards of the Coast will offer exclusive content to the TCGPlayer community. This includes exclusive previews, interviews with game designers, and exclusive reveals. For convenience, users can filter search results to discover any Magic: The Gathering products held exclusively in WPN-verified stores.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TCGplayer is focused on innovating for our community, enhancing buyer and seller<br>
experiences, and offering the best selection across trading card games,” said Stephanie Mims,<br>
Senior Vice President, Seller Experience. “Being designated the preferred online marketplace<br>
for the WPN represents a milestone in our quest to be the most trusted trading card platform for<br>
Magic players and retailers.</p>

<p><br>
Our investment in local game stores and the Wizards Play Network is at the core of this<br>
initiative,” said Brian Trunk, Vice President of Wizards Commercial, Hobby and WPN at Wizards<br>
of the Coast. “By teaming up with TCGplayer, we’re not only giving players greater confidence<br>
in their purchases, but also empowering WPN retailers to thrive, reach new audiences, and<br>
continue building strong Magic communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TCGPlayer is one of the largest virtual card retail platforms on the internet. The platform, acquired <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ebay-enters-agreement-for-tcgplayer-acquisition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by eBay</a> in early 2023 for the sum of $295 million, has helped dedicated card game players and aspirational competitive players obtain the cards they want for their respective game. Be it <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, or even the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>.</p>

<p>The platform recently came under fire due to it quickly shutting down an authentication center down in Syracuse. This was seen by the workers as an attempt to shut down the worker's union seeking better wages. This lead to a boycott starting in May 2025 before a new contract was renegotiated by the worker's union in June.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics-hit-by-layoffs-again.1353820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet another round of layoffs across "various departments and projects", and the layoffs are apparently an attempt to "restructure the company and business".</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Crystal Dynamics calls the decision to lay off "just under 30" employees a "difficult but necessary decision", and blames the evolving "realities of the industry" for the need to let more team members go.</p>

<p>The studio says that the layoffs are an attempt to "optimize the continued development of [its] flagship&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game", in addition to "shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=_PCW5_St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=XMhUvaNA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider</em>'s Crystal Dynamics is laying off yet more staff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the third time that Crystal Dynamics has engaged in layoffs this year; it first laid off a round of employees in March, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">again in August</a> following the cancellation of Xbox's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot (and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shuttering of the studio</a> chiefly responsible for making it).</p>

<p>At the time of August's layoffs, Crystal Dynamics reassured fans that&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>'s development was "unaffected" by the decision. Technically, no such reassurance has been offered for this latest wave of redundancies.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series has yet to be announced; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" rel="nofollow">an Amazon series</a> headed up by&nbsp;<em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the works, but that's the only piece of genuinely new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>media fans have to cling to for now.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the as-yet-unrevealed&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>title is the only thing on which Crystal Dynamics is actively working, so I'd imagine there's quite a lot of pressure within the studio to deliver on this one (although what exactly "this one" is, we don't yet know).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-avengers.jpg?itok=8V8wm3qe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-avengers.jpg?itok=tkJ58oB2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crystal Dynamics' last major project before&nbsp;the next&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game was 2020's ill-fated&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Avengers</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We still don't have anything approaching an idea of when a new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game might be revealed, either; Crystal Dynamics simply says it "look[s] forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future". Until then, stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/misery-returns-to-steam-following-stalker-2-devs-dmca-claim.1353817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Misery&nbsp;</i>developer Platypus Entertainment has announced that the game has made a return to Steam, following a DMCA claim that was issued by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2119830/view/809086547679772954" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the studio says that it has "resolved" the "misunderstanding" it had with GSC Game World, following a conversation with one of the Ukrainian developer's lawyers.</p>

<p>Specifically, Platypus makes reference to two issues it says were "not mentioned in the DMCA claim" and that the studio wasn't aware of. Both issues have now been resolved, and it seems like that's what has allowed&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>to be reinstated on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=RcpZB2U2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=SDTTJ7N1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Misery&nbsp;</em>is now back on Steam for your enjoyment.</figcaption></figure><p>The first issue revolved around a "helicopter model in the files" of&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says the game is "an evolution of education, non-commercial projects", and that the model, which has now been removed, "was unintentionally left in [<em>Misery</em>''s] resources as a legacy leftover".</p>

<p>Platypus goes on to say that the helicopter model in question can't be seen anywhere in&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>itself, but the studio doesn't actually state exactly where it got the model from. Still, this appears to be one of the key points of contention for GSC Game World.</p>

<p>The second point pertains to some of the guitar-based folk songs being played in&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says that for the&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games, GSC Game World "used popular folk songs" for ambient guitar-playing NPCs, and that someone affiliated with Platypus "wrote original covers of some of these songs".</p>

<p>However, it turns out that some of the songs used by Platypus "were specifically written or exclusively licensed by GSC", so those songs have been removed. However, the studio is adamant that "no original files from GSC games were used".</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-strikes-down-copycat-game-misery-with-dmca-claim" rel="nofollow">taken down</a> from Steam earlier this week following a DMCA claim by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s GSC Game World, which alleged that Platypus Entertainment's game infringed GSC's copyright.</p>

<p>This led to a rather unfortunately slur-laden <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord message</a> from developer Maewing, who subsequently <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apologized</a> for their "past words" and "old posts", although that doesn't really apply to a message that was clearly posted after the strike was filed.</p>

<p>That, however, is an issue that Platypus has addressed in its most recent Steam news post; the studio says it has "established a strict policy on Discord moderation", which means it's no longer an "anarchy dumpster fire".</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2119830/MISERY/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-is-letting-the-last-advent-calendars-go-for-pennies-the-nightmare-before-christmas-fans-get-lucky.1353811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Save 15% on the Funko Pop The Nightmare Before Christmas countdown calendar over at Amazon.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>I’ll tell you what a real nightmare before Christmas is. It’s shopping for all those gifts. Finding the right gift can be a struggle, and with lots of folks to shop for ranging across your friends, family, and loved ones, that bill can add up pretty quickly. That’s why it’s great to keep an eye out for a good deal during the holiday season. And right now, Amazon happens to have this Funko Pop advent calendar on sale featuring vinyl mini figures of beloved characters from Tim Burtons’s <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">The mystery box filled with toys is normally priced at $50, but right now you can grab it for 19% off for a limited time. That brings the price down by nearly $10 so you only end up paying $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>24 Days of Surprises</h2>
<p>Now, advent calendars make for a great Christmas gift* with a asterisk on it. The asterisk is to call out that by Christmas day, it’s already too late to give someone this gift. Unless there joy comes from just ripping open each door and having the instant gratification of all toys at once, which I guess more power to ya. But ideally, they should receive this before November 1 so they can enjoy beginning each day with a new treat in the form of Jack, Sally, or many of the other <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>characters. Perhaps they can pair opening one of the doors with completing their daily Connections in The New York Times.</p>
<p>Okay so there’s another weird caveat I need to call attention to. At the time of writing this, all throughout the item page on Amazon, it calls out to, “Open the tiny doors to 13 unique collectable Funko Pocket Pops!” Now, there are 24 doors so I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not sure if that 13 is a typo (though it comes up twice on the page) or if more than half those little compartments are empty.</p>



<p>What I do know is the box in the images calls attention to it being a “24-piece holiday calendar.” Maybe they’re not all unique and there are some repeats in there or maybe someone on the Funko marketing team just copy/pasted this part of the description and forgot to edit it. There’s only one way to know for sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">Buy yourself the Funko Pop <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>countdown calendar for the reduced price of $40 and find out what’s inside for yourself.</a> Then come back to the comments here and let me know your findings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3s-most-important-player-choice-wasnt-always-part-of-the-game-2000644323</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Witcher 3</em> lets you make a lot of choices as Geralt, the open-world RPG’s titular monster slayer, but its biggest strength is in how subtly they’re woven into the broader fabric of the world. None of the choices ever feel like they’re being telegraphed with big blinking signs. The long-term consequences are yours to parse. So it is with the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-geralt-yennefer-triss-kiera-romance-love-1849487104">big love triangle</a>, a branching path that CD Projekt Red recently revealed was a late edition to the best-seller.</p> <p>The sorceress Yennefer is who Geralt begins the game with, during a flashback at Kaer Morhen. The red-headed mage Triss Merigold doesn’t show up until halfway through when he gets to Novigrad, at which point players have the option of rekindling their past relationship or moving on as friends, depending in part on their choices during the prior game. Eventually, the player has to make their mutant playboy choose between the two, with their future partner eventually joining them at a cute little cottage at the end of both expansions.</p>

 <p>“It wasn’t [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there’s Ciri—but there was a lack of <em>something</em>.” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-didnt-originally-make-you-choose-between-romancing-yennefer-or-triss-this-decision-was-made-pretty-late/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “This decision was made pretty late, but it was great. It was a great decision.”</p>

 <p>While Yennefer is Geralt’s canonical love interest, she’s not actually in <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-witcher-game-remake-unreal-engine-5-1849816995">the first two games</a>. Triss, however, is, leading to a weird scenario&nbsp; in which many players actually have a stronger connection to her than to the witcher’s ongoing on-again, off-again partner. It would have been easy to steer him back to her for the duration of the third game, but playing up Geralt’s divided heart does a lot to give the otherwise gruff and sardonic mercenary a more emotionally engaging mini-arc within the final game.</p> <p>While Geralt will still make an appearance in <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR’s next sequel will pass the baton to Ciri as the main hero instead. Fortunately, fans of the grey wolf will get another chance to revisit the beginning of his journey in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-remake-open-world-rpg-cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-1849832000">remake of <em>The Witcher 1</em></a> that is also in the works. Neither project has a release window just yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low-2000644324</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low.1353802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right time to pick up an iPad, that time is now. Apple just kicked off most of its Black Friday deals on Amazon and spans everything from iPads and MacBooks to Apple Watches and AirTags. But perhaps the star of the show <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">is the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip (WiFi + 128GB) which is now down to $299 from its original $349 sticker price</a>. This <strong>model launched in early 2025</strong> and quickly became the best-selling tablet on the market so to see it drop to an all-time low this quickly almost feels too good to be true.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Apple redesigned this iPad to handle the kind of multitasking most of us throw at our devices daily. The A16 chip powers through photo editing, gaming and streaming without hesitation. You get 128GB of storage right out of the gate and gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and documents before you even think about cloud storage.</p>



<h2>Best Value for Money Tablet</h2>
<p>It’s an <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display</strong> that brings colors to life in such a way that streaming movies or editing photos becomes genuinely enjoyable. True Tone technology changes the color temperature of the screen with respect to your surroundings, so you are not squinting at a harsh blue glow by night or straining to see details by bright sunlight. This may sound minor until you realize how much easier it makes long reading sessions or late-night work sessions go on your eyes. The screen hits that sweet spot where it’s large enough for serious work but compact enough to toss in a bag without thinking twice.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</strong> keeps you moving at full speed when you’re downloading files, uploading content, or jumping between video calls. The USB-C connector finally standardized charging and data transfer, meaning you can use the same cable for your iPad that you use for most of your other devices. There are 12MP cameras on both the front and back of the device, giving you solid options for video calls, document scanning, or just quick photos when you don’t have your phone handy. An important addition is Center Stage, a technology in the front camera that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you quick access without typing passwords constantly. You unlock the iPad, sign into apps, and authorize Apple Pay transactions with just your fingerprint. The <strong>iPadOS uses hardware to full capacity</strong>, and allows you to run multiple apps side by side, use the Scribble to handwrite in any text field with an Apple Pencil, and organize your workflow in ways that actually make sense.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to create the wackiest and wildest Black Ops 7 content imaginable, you can now do so with the new green screen innovation found in one of the game’s various matchmaking features.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has some interesting new features. There’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-what-is-cursed-mode-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cursed Mode</a> and, from a gameplay perspective, there’s a significant lack of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aim Assist</a>. There’s so much more in between, but we know why you’re here: Call of Duty’s first-ever in-game green screen—which is exactly as it sounds.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-has-a-green-screen">Black Ops 7 Has A Green Screen</h2>

<p>It seems like Treyarch is specifically catering to streamers and content creators with the introduction of a new green screen map. The first-time-ever feature can only be found in <strong>Private Match</strong>—which makes sense—and it literally is just a green screen map, and wouldn’t be ideal for a competitive lobby.</p>



<p>Once you load into the map, the world is just one giant green screen. This allows you to seamlessly create thumbnails for all types of content creation.</p>







<p>Here’s what Treyarch had to say on it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A little surprise for content creators: our new Green Screen map is available in Private Matches for all your thumbnail creation needs. This has been a goal for us ever since we added a green screen to the Studio map back in BO2. Go forth and create!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 2 only had the green screen as a bit-part aspect of a wider map. However, this is a fully-fledged green screen map, acting as your own personal home studio. It allows you to switch out your guns, pose with them, and handily whip up thumbnails.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A little surprise for content creators: our new Green Screen map is available in Private Matches for all your thumbnail creation needs. </p><p>This has been a goal for us ever since we added a green screen to the Studio map back in BO2. Go forth and create! <a href="https://t.co/zxonI8Eha7">pic.twitter.com/zxonI8Eha7</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1989005194781450488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>To be fair, in a game that’s had its fair share of ups and downs already, this feels like a bona fide winner. It’s a perfect quality of life addition that makes the lives of many easier. Plus, even if you’re not a content creator, who’s to say you can’t find some inspiration and bring out the inner-Picasso from within?</p>



<p>Is this a smart move from the dev team? What other game-changing content like this could CoD do?

                <p>Sony and NCSoft just announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/" data-ref-id="1100-6536174">Horizon spin-off called Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-franchise-was-created-with-multiplayer-in-mind-says-guerrilla-games-boss/1100-6536213/" data-ref-id="1100-6536213">mobile-first, multiplayer-focused MMO</a> that's in the works for mobile and PC--but not Sony's flagship PlayStation 5 console.</p><p>Executive producer Sunggu Lee <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to IGN</a> about the game and answered some questions people might be wondering, like if Aloy is in the game, what the game's inspirations are, how combat works, and more.</p><p>Asked if Aloy, or other well-known Horizon characters, are in Horizon Steel Frontiers, Lee said, "We haven't finalized whether characters from the original game will appear, so it's too early to share any specific plans."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwAulK6db4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another question that came up is where Horizon Steel Frontiers fits within the wider Horizon universe. Lee said it is indeed set inside the Horizon world, but in a new place, the Deadlands, which is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. "While Aloy and her allies are fighting for the fate of the world in the north, the southern Deadlands face a new threat. Players step into the role of machine hunters drawn to this dangerous frontier," Lee said.</p><p>As for the Horizon Steel Frontiers combat mechanics, Lee said the MMO and the main game series from Guerrilla share the same core idea of fighting big machines. But the combat systems are "quite different," Lee said. "In Steel Frontiers, it’s all about managing distance and making quick decisions--when to attack and when to dodge. We've kept the tension and excitement of the original hunts, but redesigned the combat to deliver a fresh experience that's optimized for multiplayer hunting action," Lee said.</p><p>We also learned in the interview that NCSoft was inspired by Capcom's Monster Hunter series for Steel Frontiers. "Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon's core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point," Lee said.</p><p>What's more, Lee discussed the differences between the mobile and PC versions of Horizon Frontiers. "Mobile offers quick, on-the-go session play, while PC provides a richer, more strategic combat experience--each platform playing to its strengths," Lee said.</p><p>Steel Frontiers does not have a release date yet. For fans of the main Horizon series, developer Guerrilla says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/" data-ref-id="1100-6536178">more games are coming, including a possible multiplayer game. </a></p>

                <p>Dragami Games has announced that the upcoming Switch 2 port of Lollipop Chainsaw has been delayed. It was previously set to launch this November but is now coming in "early 2026."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1989252238347567413" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The developer said</a> the delay was due to the volume of requests for a physical edition of the game's RePOP remaster version. The studio wanted to align the digital and physical releases, so it opted to delay all versions to 2026.</p><p>"We sincerely apologize for the extended wait and any inconvenience this may cause. We appreciate your understanding and continued support," Dragami said.</p><p>James Gunn--the co-CEO of DC Studios and the director of the recently released Superman reboot--co-wrote the story for Lollipop Chainsaw, which was co-directed by Goichi Suda aka Suda51. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suda51-and-james-gunn-wont-be-involved-in-the-lollipop-chainsaw-remake/1100-6505128/" data-ref-id="1100-6505128">neither Gunn nor Suda51 had any involvement with the remaster</a>.</p><p>The RePOP edition originally came out in 2024 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The new edition includes "the latest graphics," along with "speedier chainsaw action." For anyone unaware, Lollipop Chainsaw tells the story of Juliet Starling, a student who loves cheerleading and killing zombies.</p><p>The Switch 2 is soaring right now, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">passing 10 million units sold</a> to become Nintendo's fastest-selling console ever.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neowiz-is-making-a-lies-of-p-sequel-but-it%E2%80%99s-also-making-another-new-soulslike-and-a-new-narrative-rpg.1353775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that Neowiz, the parent company of Round 8 Studio, the team behind<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/"> Lies of P </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture</a>, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/">working on a sequel to its Bloodborne-like hit</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/">has sold over 3 million copies since its launch</a>. But a Lies of P sequel isn't the only project that Neowiz has on the go. In fact, it's not even the only Souls-like game Neowiz has in development.</p>



<p>Per the studio's <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">latest investor presentation</a>, it has a total of five projects set to release on PC and consoles in development at its in-house studios. If you add its mobile games, it has seven total projects on the go from its internal teams.</p>



<p>Of those five projects, one of them is the sequel to Lies of P. Another is a new Souls-like project led by Kay Lee at Neowiz. Another is a new narrative-focused RPG led by Seungho Jin, and rounding out the remaining two is a new life simulator game, and a new survival action title.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Neowiz</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The company definitely has a lot on its plate, but after Lies of P, it's difficult not to be completely excited for whatever the studio is cooking up. With Lies of P, the studio proved it could enter a highly competitive and, for many players, oversaturated genre and still find ways to improve and innovate on what came before, even if it didn't hit its mark perfectly.</p>



<p>So, hearing that it'll be trying to do that again with both a sequel to Lies of P and an entirely new Souls-like, and it'll be entering the survival-action game genre, and a new life simulation game, sparks further excitement around how the studio could potentially innovate in those genres. At least, that's the hope.</p>

Using a standalone VR headset can feel more freeing when playing games than being connected to a PC with a cable, but it’ll still weigh heavily on your head, so you may feel some strain after wearing it for a little while. However, its sale price and included extras make it an especially great choice if you’ve never tried a VR headset before, or are shopping for a gift for a gamer.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820921/meta-quest-3s-black-friday-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are already coming in hot. This is a great time to grab both the essentials and big-ticket items you have been keeping an eye on, without paying the full price. Those looking for a powerful tablet that can turn into a full-fledged Windows laptop when needed should consider the Microsoft Surface Pro, especially now that it’s going for a lot less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/">The 2024 model of this machine typically retails for $2,100, but you can now snag it for $1,550 after a nice 26% discount.</a> This discount applies to the Platinum model and is available to both Prime and non-Prime members. It’s also one of the steepest price drops we have seen on this model, but we’re not expecting it to last long. It’s best to grab yours before the price shoots back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen, Plus All-Day Battery Life</h2>
<p>It’s slightly bigger than most tablets out there. You’re getting a 13-inch OLED touchscreen display that delivers brilliant visuals with exceptional color accuracy in both bright and dim settings.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is so focused on its single-player story that you might have forgotten the RPG has a competitive mode like most other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. This four-player versus mode pits you and the other trainers against one another in a race to see who can defeat the most monsters in a short amount of time. Even if you’re not a competitive person, you might still be playing this mode to try and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>unlock some of the Mega Stones gated behind it</span></a><span>. So you want it to be fair, right? Well, it sounds like the mode is being overrun by hackers who are cheating their way to victory.</span></p>   <p><span>I don’t play much of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer myself, so the first time I was clued into the hacking epidemic was through a video on TikTok that showed a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Garchomp</span></a><span> repeatedly using its powerful ground-type attack Earthquake without any cooldowns. Because there was no gap in between these devastating area-of-effect moves, its trainer racked up points on the scoreboard so quickly that there was no way anyone else could catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What I didn’t realize at the time was that this has become so widespread that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>creators are weighing in and providing their own footage of rigged online matches. Some of the possible hacks might not be that recognizable to the untrained eye. AustinJohnPlays has an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAqhVep_5dc"><span>extensive video</span></a><span> on several hacked Pokémon he and others have encountered online, though not all of the exploits are as damning as a Garchomp with no cooldowns.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For example, he shows a Lucario who seems to have been captured with a Poké Ball that isn’t available in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. This doesn’t give anyone a competitive advantage but it’s an example of how some people are clearly modding the game in various ways. Some are advantageous in competitive play, like someone having an </span><a href="https://x.com/amiosi/status/1986910946556535092?s=20"><span>Alpha Xerneas</span></a><span>, a larger, more powerful form of a Legendary Pokémon that is only obtainable once in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and not as an Alpha. Clearly, some players are up to hacked shenanigans and taking these unobtainable Pokémon online.</span></p>

  <p><span>Some of the hacks AustinJohnPlays highlights might seem harmless, such as some players changing their in-game trainer ID card images to real photos, but when you see there’s an astronomical gap between their online scores and those of regular players, it’s probably safe to assume they’re also messing with the stats, movesets, and properties of their Pokémon.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t have any kind of reporting or blocking feature, so these hackers are running around in competitive battles, spamming moves and using Pokémon they shouldn’t be able to access. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

Another option, meanwhile, sees the player convincing Karlach to depart Faerûn to live in Avernus and hope for a more permanent cure — leaving the character's ultimate survival open to debate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans think they finally have an answer for what happens next if Karlach does go back to Avernus, thanks to the canon Astarion's Book of Hungers D&amp;D Expansion. This book confirms that a pair of other D&amp;D installments that feature Karlach are set post-Baldur's Gate 3. Therefore, canonically, Karlach survived for several years after the game's epilogue, and is back in Faerûn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Progressing the year to 1501 and having Karlach in the city again implies she gets her engine fixed in canon," social media user RenMasaoAnkoku wrote, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-doesnt-give-karlach-the-ending-she-deserves-but-new-d-and-d-lore-unintentionally-confirms-a-much-more-favorable-canon-for-the-beloved-tiefling/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar+</a>. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Them progressing the year to 1501 and having Karlach in the city again implies she gets her engine fixed in canon <a href="https://t.co/A8akZTyUzQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/A8akZTyUzQ</a></p>— Ren Masao Ankoku (@RenMasaoAnkoku) <a href="https://twitter.com/RenMasaoAnkoku/status/1988633021474353634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The post shares an official timeline of fellow companion Astarion's life that places "the events of Baldur's Gate 3" in 1492, by Dalereckoning (DR). Meanwhile, the events of Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn and Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn — in which Karlach appears — take place three years later, in 1501 DR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This fits with what we already know of Karlach's possible future should she be convinced back to Avernus. In the game's epilogue, set six months later, Karlach mentions a recent adventure where she obtained a set of blueprints offering a possible solution for her infernal engine. Seemingly, then, these worked — for another few years, at least — to allow her back to Faerûn and hopefully another reunion with your party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian may be done with major updates, but it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-hotfix-34-adds-native-steam-deck-build-reduces-framerate-spikes-in-busy-areas-such-as-the-lower-city-in-act-3-across-all-platforms">still releasing occasional hotfixes</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mario Kart DS is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, November 14, 2025. Below, we examine how the fan community has kept the game alive, and online, long after official servers were retired.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Mario Kart DS launched in 2005, it felt like a glimpse into the future. For the first time, Nintendo’s chaotic, shell-filled racer could be played online, pitting players from around the world against each other in real-time competition. It was a leap few handheld games had dared to make at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Two decades later, the official Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers that powered those matchups are long gone, but the race never really stopped. Through fan-built tools, open-source servers, and emulation projects, Mario Kart DS remains alive and well--still spinning its wheels in the hands of a dedicated community that refuses to let it drift into the past.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Nintendo DS debuted, it was marketed as a “third pillar” for the company--a strange, dual-screen experiment meant to sit alongside the GameCube and Game Boy Advance. But with Mario Kart DS, the touch screen rarely came into play. The game focused the series’ easy-to-pick-up gameplay with a forward-thinking approach that accelerated Mario Kart into the future. GameSpot, in fact, loved the game in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mario Kart DS is without a doubt one of the best games to hit the Nintendo DS to date," GameSpot's reviewer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-ds-review/1900-6139765/">wrote</a>. "The game plays every bit as well as any of its predecessors, and adds just enough new features to the mix to make it worthy of your attention, even if you're still playing any of those games on a regular basis. The online play is undoubtedly the icing on an especially yummy cake, and even if you're not in a position to sample said icing, a yummy cake without icing is still a yummy cake."</p><p dir="ltr">Using Nintendo’s Wi-Fi Connection service, players could race online via local hotspots or home internet connections. It wasn’t perfect--online matchmaking was limited to a handful of tracks, and finding friends required clunky friend codes--but it was enough to ignite a new kind of competition. Suddenly, players could test their drifting skills against strangers halfway across the globe. For many, it was their first taste of online console gaming at all.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC4Ohj0jdBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pC4Ohj0jdBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Beyond its online capabilities, Mario Kart DS also raised the bar for what handheld racing could be. It introduced retro cups, reimagining classic tracks from previous entries. It popularized snaking, a technique where skilled players could chain boosts by quickly alternating drifts, giving the game a competitive depth.</p><p dir="ltr">When Nintendo shut down its Wi-Fi Connection servers in 2014, it seemed like the end of an era. Online play for Mario Kart DS--and dozens of other Nintendo titles--was suddenly gone. But like any good racer, fans found a way to take a shortcut.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just found a way to play Mario Kart DS online again. It's really cool that you can still do this,' one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartDS/comments/1cfjera/playing_mario_kart_ds_online_in_2024/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2024. "It's not as active as the Wii, but it's actually pretty easy to find a match."</p><p dir="ltr">Through reverse engineering and open-source initiatives like Wiimmfi and AltWFC, the game’s online features were kept alive by the community. Players could still race together. The process wasn’t always simple--it required custom patches or modified DNS settings--but it worked.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, fan communities continue to organize races and tournaments. Whenever players went online to post that they found a new way to play Mario kart DS online, but that they couldn't find other players, other Mario Kart DS fans pointed them towards a thriving <a href="https://discord.gg/mario-kart-ds-network-569870981213061120" rel="nofollow ">Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of community and legacy is what drives many of these projects. In an era where online games can disappear with the flip of a server switch, Mario Kart DS has become a case study in fan-powered preservation. It’s proof that players can keep a game alive long after its corporate support ends--through passion, a little technical skill, and sheer determination.</p><p dir="ltr">Even by today’s standards, Mario Kart DS feels remarkably tight. Its track design, item balance, and snappy controls strike a near-perfect blend of skill and chaos. The game’s focus on pure mechanics--no anti-gravity, bikes, motion controls, or touch-screen gameplay--makes it a favorite for players who crave the series’ classic feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Its simplicity is part of its staying power. Modern entries like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart World are spectacular in scope, but DS captures a more stripped-down energy--a focus on short bursts of fun that perfectly fit the handheld format. Races are quick, items are well-tuned, and the roster, while smaller with 12 standard racers including most of Mario's immediate family, friends, and rivals, is iconic.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s also a game that rewards mastery. Snaking and mini-turbo management turned what looked like a casual party racer into a surprisingly deep competitive title. The best players could maintain near-constant boosts, flying through tracks with dizzying speed. Nintendo eventually toned this down in later games, but among longtime fans, Mario Kart DS remains the “technical” entry--the one that truly separated the pros from the pack.</p><p dir="ltr">As Mario Kart DS turns 20, its community, while small, is firmly in cruise control. Players continue to introduce newcomers to its underground online scene. For many, keeping the game alive isn’t just nostalgia--it’s a statement about access in the digital age.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Mario Kart will likely continue to evolve, beyond the sandbox experiment of Mario Kart World and the fun augmented reality of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit. But in many ways, Mario Kart DS set the standard. It proved that online play could work on a handheld and that great design never goes out of style.</p><p dir="ltr">Twenty years on, the finish line isn't even on the track. The race, at least for now, feels endless. The drivers are still out hugging turns on Delfino Square and dodging obstacles on Waluigi Pinball with their feet firmly planted on the gas pedal.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image Credit: XCageGame on YouTube</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Starting with Horizon Zero Dawn and followed up with Horizon Forbidden West, the PlayStation franchise has seen players following protagonist Aloy on a single-player adventure. With the recent reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, the focus changes from a solo affair to an MMO.

But going forward, the studio will focus more on this social aspect. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," wrote van Beek.

That would be a first for the franchise, as even the spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-new-heights/1900-6418028/" data-ref-id="1900-6418028">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> was released for PlayStation VR 2. The MMO looks a bit inspired by the Monster Hunter series and will feature large-scale raids. Meanwhile, Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, arguing the game is a "slavish clone" of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">As van Beek implies, multiplayer looks here to stay with the Horizon franchise. In fact, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/">reported that a multiplayer Horizon game is the next project from Guerrilla</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a live-action Horizon movie in the works</a>, though no directors, writers, or cast members have been announced.</p>
