<p>Nintendo recently updated its music app on mobile devices, and this week it has released a new update for its Switch Parental Controls app.</p>
<p>According to the patch notes, this bumps it up to <strong>Version 2.2.0</strong> and it comes with a handful of updates to improve the overall experience. One, in particular, improves the 'Play Activity' display. Here are the full patch notes (via the App Store):</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls - Version 2.2.0 (August, 2025)</h3>

<li>Other small improvements have also been made.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This follows a major update in May, adding Switch 2 support to the system - including settings related to the GameChat feature, and various other extended features like the ability to extend daily play-time limits:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042 Could Be Getting a ‘Surprisingly Big’ Update Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-could-be-getting-a-%E2%80%98surprisingly-big%E2%80%99-update-soon.1269792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been suggested on social media that Battlefield 2042, the most recent game in the series to hit the open market, will get a ‘surprisingly big’ content update soon. It was theorized that this could be the final update to hit the Battlefield 2042 platform before Battlefield 6 is released worldwide on October 10.</p>



<p>The claimed update that comes from ‘Temporyal’ on social media includes a new map, three new weapons, and two new vehicles being broken out of the Battlefield Vault.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-s-final-content-update">Battlefield 2042’s Final Content Update</h2>



<p>With Battlefield 6 sitting tantalizingly close on that horizon, Battlefield 2042 is preparing to become a forgotten thing of the past. In a new post on social media, prolific dataminer ‘Temporyal’ claimed that a ‘surprisingly big’ update is headed to Battlefield 2042, and that it might be <strong>the final update</strong> for the game, content-wise.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Battlefield 2042 may be getting a surprisingly big (maybe final?) content update soon.</p><p>New Map:<br>🇯🇵 Iwo Jima</p><p>New Weapons:<br>🤫 The Prototype (“Riverdweller”)<br>🔫 KFS2000 (FN F2000)<br>🎯 GM6 Lynx</p><p>New Vault Vehicles:<br>🇺🇸 A-10 Warthog<br>🇷🇺 SU-25TM Frogfoot</p><p>🪖 Pax Armata-themed cosmetics <a href="https://t.co/vvZ3P4uhUl">pic.twitter.com/vvZ3P4uhUl</a></p></div>— temporyal (@temporyal) <a href="https://twitter.com/temporyal/status/1955701622660591897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Iwo Jima is a setting we’ve seen before in the Battlefield world, even if it seems a little out of left field for Battlefield 2042 (and Battlefield 6, for that matter).</p>



<p>The suggestion that this update includes Pax Armata is interesting. It almost guarantees it’ll drop soon, as Pax Armata is the antagonist faction in Battlefield 6, and this would be Electronic Arts fuelling the hype for the next game by bleeding it into Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>I’m personally more interested in the return of the SU-25TM and the A-10. They’re timeless classics in the Battlefield space, and raking the ground with fire from the Warthog’s auto-cannon never gets old.</p>



<p><strong>BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT</strong>.</p>



<p>Temporyal explained a little more about the Pax Armata cosmetics by offering a description from a datamined bundle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A new way of warfare has been born, and that requires soldiers trained for the task. Pax Armata intends to change the world – will you join their ranks or become one of the conquered?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you eager to see the back of Battlefield 2042, or are you intent on enjoying this potentially final content update? Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><strong>Kang Dong Yeon, Director:</strong> “Hello, I’m Kang Dong Yeon, director of <em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em>.</p><p><strong>Mok Youngmi, Art Director: “</strong>Hi, I’m Mok Youngmi, art director of Woochi the Wayfarer.”</p><p><strong>What kind of project is this?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “We are LoreVault, a name that means ‘a vault of stories.’ <em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em> is an action-adventure game we’re creating here at LoreVault. It combines a moving, memorable story with a richly imagined Joseon-era setting, and the thrilling battle action of a ‘Dosa(the Mage of the Way).'”</p><p><strong>What is the setting of the game?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Internally, we call it ‘Joseon fantasy.’ We’re building a world based on historical research, blending in imaginative and fantastical elements to enrich the gameplay. You’ll meet characters from Korean myths—‘Dosa’, Dokkaebi, Gumiho, and more from this fusion period drama.”</p><p><strong>What does the title mean?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “As the title suggests, the hero is Woochi, a legendary ‘Dosa’ well-known among Korean gamers. At its core, the story follows Woochi during his training to become a ‘Dosa.’ The game is built around the adventures he experiences on that journey. We felt it was important for the title to symbolically capture the hero’s identity, story, and goals. After exploring various possibilities to express all these aspects, we decided on the title <em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em>. Since we’re aiming for a global release, we chose an English title to feel more approachable to players worldwide.”</p><p><strong>How does this differ from the original Woochi?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Woochi’s story has many traditional versions, which makes him open to broad interpretation. We want to capture his existing charm, while adding our own vision—creating something distinct from films or TV dramas. We blend traditional Korean looks like gat, hanbok, and dorongi with fantasy elements to create our unique version of Woochi.”</p><p><strong>What type of game is this?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “The game is a story-driven single-player title with combat. With our story, we aim to leave players with a lasting emotional impact by the time they reach the ending. Of the various storytelling methods, we especially focus on delivering the narrative through striking cinematic direction. Equally important, we aim to deliver thrilling combat scenes in many forms, creating a game that’s just as fun to play.”</p><p><strong>Does the game have a dark tone or atmosphere?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “We didn’t set out to make it dark, but the characters and environments shown so far have a heavier tone, which might have given that impression. In reality, the game’s core atmosphere is bright, colorful, and warm. We believe these vibrant colors and inviting tone will clearly distinguish us from other East Asian fantasy titles. To give you a sense of the atmosphere, we’ve prepared a short in-game clip—though the visuals are not yet final.”</p><p><strong>Does the magpie wearing a gat actually appear in the game?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “Yes, it will. When we saw <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em>, we were genuinely surprised—and delighted. We could tell the creators had done a lot of research, and we really related to that. While some motifs may overlap, our game will feature a far more realistic and adorable magpie, as well as a majestic tiger. We can’t share too much without spoiling the story, but the shaman character ‘Myoan’ from our teaser will also appear in the game.”</p><p><strong>What did you want to convey through the teaser video?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Every shot in the teaser was created using actual in-game assets. We aimed to capture scenes exactly as they appear in-game, so the video could convey the real mood and quality of the title. We’re using 3D scanning and <a title="Platforms > Meta [148 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>Human-based facial work to create lifelike characters with an immersive presence. By presenting high-quality versions of distinctly Korean elements such as the magpie, the shaman, and the ‘Dosa,’ we wanted to highlight the game’s identity.”</p><p><strong>What’s the story behind the magpie wearing a gat?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “In the video, the magpie copies a scholar’s look, wearing a gat it crafted from twigs. I personally find it quite cute.”</p><p><strong>When will the game be released?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “The video we’ve released this time is an announcement teaser. This teaser is meant not only to showcase our project to players, but also to appeal to fellow developers. While the release date is still undecided, we’ll keep sharing updates as development progresses.”</p><p><strong>What are the strengths and challenges of using the Joseon era as the game’s setting?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “One of our big advantages is easy access to reference materials, such as lifestyle, architecture, clothing, and food. We also take inspiration from exploring real Korean landscapes, which has been incredibly helpful. For many on our team, this is their first time working this way, and they’re really enjoying it. The challenge is finding the right balance between accuracy and fantasy. Because the Joseon era was a real period in our history, accuracy and responsibility matter. At the same time, imagination and creativity are key to gameplay. So we’re always discussing what to portray realistically and what to reinterpret. When it comes to mythical creatures from folklore, reference images are often scarce or nonexistent. That makes them tricky to design, but also makes it exciting—we get to bring them to life through our own interpretation.”</p><p><strong>Do you have a message for developers interested in this project?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “This is a particularly challenging genre to take on in Korea. so we actively seek people with a bold, adventurous mindset. And because we’re making a single-player package game, a dream for many developers, we especially welcome those with a passion for this kind of project.”</p><p><strong>How can developers join the project?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “If you click the link below this video, you’ll be taken to the Nexon Games careers page. There, you can search for ‘LoreVault’ or ‘Woochi’ in English to find information about open positions.”</p><p><strong>Do you have a message for developers interested in this project?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Being able to capture the beauty of Korea in our game is such a unique advantage, and anyone who joins our studio will find it enjoyable. If you’re interested in or knowledgeable about the Joseon era, we’d be thrilled to have you join us. We’ll continue to share news as we go. Thank you for your interest and support.”</p></div><p><em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,679 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,900 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.

<p>From the team behind Cruis'n Blast</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Arcade racing fans have another game to look forward to this year, with GameMill Entertainment announcing it will be bringing <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fast_and_furious_arcade_edition">Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</a></strong> to the Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>24th October, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/cruisn_blast">Cruis'n Blast</a> vibes from this one, that's because developer Raw Thrills was behind the original 2022 arcade cabinet release. Cradle Games (which helped out with the port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_arcade_wrath_of_the_mutants">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants</a>) is assisting with this latest home console release.</p>
<p>Here's a brief description about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Experience the thrill of the Fast &amp; Furious Arcade in attract mode! This video showcases the high-speed action and immersive arcade gameplay that makes this racing game a must-play for arcade enthusiasts. Watch as we dive into the heart-pounding excitement of the Fast &amp; Furious Arcade, where players can race through iconic locations, drive powerful cars, and experience the ultimate arcade attraction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Raw Thrills released Cruis'n Blast on Switch in 2021, we called it a hugely entertaining arcade-style racer, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>
<p>Much like Cruis'n Blast, Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition also features licensed cars and includes all kinds of action-packed sequences. As noted in the press release and video above, racers can look forward to split-screen multiplayer as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hit the road in legendary cars including the Dodge Charger, Corvette Z06, Shelby GT500 KR, Ford GT, Bronco DR, Jeep Wrangler and more - plus customize your car with unique color schemes.</p>
<p>Race through each of the original arcade game’s tracks solo or in split-screen with a friend and discover destructible environments, branching paths, and sneaky shortcuts that can shake up any race and reward risk-takers. Take on thrilling challenges with high-stakes objectives like intercepting a missile in the Swiss Alps or grounding a plane in the heart of Hong Kong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The press package also includes a look at a European physical Switch release. It mentions how this is a "download code only".</p>

                <p>After adding two-player expeditions in the last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update, From Software's latest patch is adding some balance adjustments to the powerful abilities that come with the legendary sword known as Storm Ruler.</p><p>Going forward, it won't take as long to charge the storm effect and the animation speed of the blade will be faster. Overall, the performance of Storm Ruler will be increased, even when the attack power isn't charged with the storm. However, those upgrades come with a tweak that removes the bug that allowed players to use Storm Ruler without burning through FP.</p><p>The update also includes a number of other bug fixes, including one that addresses slowdown for other players when using too many Sorceries and Incantations. Performance issues appear to have been the main problems addressed in the patch, but there were others as well, including a bug that prevented some attacks of the Everdark Sovereign Caligo, Miasma of Night from hitting other players.</p><p>There was also one bug fix that specific to PlayStation 5, where both the user interface and the heads-up display might disappear for players. That bug might be followed by the game crashing altogether if players attempted to continue playing.</p><p>What's coming next for Nightreign after this patch? A recent datamine suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-ranked-mode-could-be-coming-according-to-datamine/1100-6533778/" data-ref-id="1100-6533778">a ranked mode may be debuting on Nightreign</a> in the future. Last month, Bandai Namco and From Software announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">Nightreign has shipped 5 million copies</a> since its debut at the end of May.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-confirmed-for-switch-2/1100-6530541/" data-ref-id="1100-6530541">Tarnished Edition for Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year, which will include the base game and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion. There's also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-director-is-more-than-familiar-with-the-game/1100-6532534/" data-ref-id="1100-6532534">live-action Elden Ring movie in development from A24 with Alex Garland slated to direct.</a></p><p>The complete patch notes for Elden Ring Nightreign version 1.02.1 are included below.</p><h3>Balance Adjustments</h3><ul><li>Increased the performance of the skill "Storm Ruler"</li><li>Reduced the time to charge the storm effect</li><li>Increased the speed of the blade unleashed by the attack</li><li>Increased the attack power when not charged with the storm</li></ul><h3>Bug Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, using dropped items would prevent any actions other than moving and camera operation.</li><li>Fixed a bug where effects triggered by successful guards would not activate for certain guard actions.</li><li>Fixed a bug where target lock would immediately be released on eggs or insects parasitizing the player character when Duchess's Ultimate Art "Finale" effect is active.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks by Everdark Sovereign "Maris, Fathom of Night" would cause stagger damage when negated with the Executor's Skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, the relic effect "[Executor] While Character Skill is active, unlocking use of cursed sword restores HP" would not activate.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the skill "Storm Ruler" could be used without consuming FP by specific steps.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the damage dealt to enemies by the passive effect "Frostbite Produces a Mist of Frost" was higher than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where using a Flask would not heal the player's own HP when equipped with relics that have the effect "Flask Also Heals Allies".</li><li>Note: We have identified a bug where healing is not distributed or the amount of healing distributed changes for allies who have acquired the passive effect "Gradual Restoration by Flask." This will be fixed in a future update.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the displayed effect value of "Extended Spell Duration" differed from the actual effect value.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the color of effects generated by certain Passive Effects was different than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks of the Everdark Sovereign, “Caligo, Miasma of Night,” would not hit playable characters.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the framerate would drop during battles with Everdark Sovereigns "Caligo, Miasma of Night" and "Maris, Fathom of Night" under certain conditions.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the number of displayed relics did not match the actual number shown when sorting by "Order by Size" or "Order by Color" in the Relic Rites menu.</li><li>Fixed a bug where certain relics could not be equipped when using specific filter functions in the Relic Rites menu.</li><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, audio may not play correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where continuous use of Sorceries and Incantations would degrade game performance for other players.</li><li>Fixed a bug where activating certain passive effects or continuous use of Sorceries and Incantations could impact network stability.</li><li>Corrected some texts in Brazilian Portuguese.</li></ul><h3>Only for PS5 Bug Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the UI, including the HUD, would disappear and the game might unexpectedly terminate if play were continued.</li></ul>

If your idea of fun involves turning mana into spectacular destruction, Terraria’s magic weapons are your bread and butter. From humble sparks to kaleidoscopic death rays, these staves of sorcery are the ultimate tools for mages looking to leave a scorching impression.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic wands in Terraria are more than just damage sticks.

It’s not subtle, shooting tiny flames with modest damage, but it’s notably accessible. You can find it in surface chests or wooden crates from fishing, meaning there’s a decent chance you’ll be clearing out caves and singeing zombies before you’ve even built a proper house.</p><p dir="ltr">It has the lowest mana cost in the game at just two per shot, letting you spam fire bolts without worrying too much about blue star supplies. Equip early mana-boosting accessories like the Magic Cuffs for a touch more staying power, and it’ll carry you comfortably until stronger dungeon loot appears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549328"></a><figcaption>Magic Missile floats towards its target</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_Missile">Magic Missile</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 35</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 7.5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 22 (Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Looted from Dungeon chests after defeating Skeletron, the Magic Missile feels like an upgrade in both power and control. You guide its projectile with your cursor until you release it or it hits an obstacle, letting you strike around corners or through gaps. The explosion on impact is perfect for clearing out enemies huddled behind cover.</p><p dir="ltr">The only catch is the moderate mana cost, but by the time you find one, you should have a healthy pool to work with. Pair it with the Jungle Armour set for early magic bonuses, and you’ll have a spell that can comfortably handle most pre-Hardmode bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549329" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549329"></a><figcaption>Demon Scythe shoots Demon Sickles at a Herpling</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Demon_Scythe">Demon Scythe</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 35</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost:14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by Demons in the Underworld, the Demon Scythe is a deceptively strong choice for players with good aim. It summons scythe projectiles that deal very high damage and can pierce multiple enemies at once. The initial slow travel speed makes it less ideal for fast-moving targets, but it’s a blessing against the flailing limbs of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria bosses</a> like Skeletron and Wall of Flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">Farming this means braving the lava-filled Underworld, so bring Obsidian Skin Potions and a ranged backup weapon in case those Demons get too close. At this point, you’ll be ready to transition to Hardmode, as the Demon Scythe is one of the few early magic weapons that keeps pace with the rising stakes, including faster enemies with higher health pools.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hardmode">Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549330" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549330"></a><figcaption>Crystal Storm ricochets off Temple walls</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crystal_Storm">Crystal Storm</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 32</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 7 (Extremely fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Crafted from 20 Crystal Shards, 15 Souls of Light, and a Spell Tome using a Bookcase, the Crystal Storm turns you into a walking bullet hell machine. Its rapid-fire projectiles ricochet off walls, chewing through enemies in tight arenas, which is particularly ideal for crowd control in events and invasions.</p><p dir="ltr">The low individual mana cost is deceptive, as each shot rapidly drains your reserves. You’ll need the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories for magic</a> in early Hardmode and potions to sustain fire for long stretches. Pair it with the Mana Flower or Celestial Cuffs, and you’ll fend off the Pirate Invasion like few other weapons can at this stage of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549331" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549331"></a><figcaption>Betsy's Wrath rains down in threes</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Betsy___s_Wrath">Betsy’s Wrath</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 100</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by Betsy in the Old One’s Army event, which only occurs after you’ve defeated the Golem, Betsy’s Wrath is a versatile magic weapon. Firing a trio of fireballs, the magic weapon not only covers a wider area than most alternatives, but it also inflicts the Betsy’s Curse debuff, which substantially reduces your enemy’s defence.</p><p dir="ltr">As you navigate the third act, Betsy’s Wrath is a perfect choice for boss fights and multiplayer scenarios, boosting overall team damage. Its fast firing rate and good range make it a flexible all-rounder in Hardmode. Just make sure you have the space, as low ceilings hinder the weapon’s effectiveness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549332" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549332"></a><figcaption>Converged Last Prism fires a singular beam</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Last_Prism">Last Prism</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 100</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 0.25</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 10 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by the Moon Lord, the Last Prism is Terraria’s ultimate magic weapon, firing a rainbow beam that converges into pure, boss-melting energy. It’s absurdly mana-hungry, draining reserves in seconds, but with Nebula Armour, Celestial Cuffs, and Mana Regeneration Potions, you can keep it firing long enough to erase even the game’s toughest foes.</p><p dir="ltr">For sustained output, tap-fire to conserve mana between bursts; for sheer spectacle, hold it down and watch the world disappear in light. Nothing else comes close to its mix of style and raw, unstoppable power, giving you the victory lap you truly deserve.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Abracadabra">Abracadabra</h2><p dir="ltr">Magic wands offer a unique flavour of combat compared to other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/">Terraria weapon types</a>, trading brute force for precision, style, and sometimes outright spectacle. Whether you’re igniting slimes in the forest, painting laser trails across the sky, or collapsing bosses under a prism of doom, there’s a spell to match your mood and progression.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep your mana high, your gear in top form, and your spellbook stocked because when the next boss arrives, you’ll want more than just firepower. You’ll want a little magic.</p>

In addition to looking absolutely stupendous, this figure comes with a base with a red “M” on it and a clear stand (so you can pose him jumping).

              <p>I spent years playing games without ever thinking about the controller I was using. It was just the thing that came in the box with the system. If you wanted to play co-op, you’d buy a second. If it broke, you’d replace it. It wasn’t until the PS4 and Xbox One generation that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-quest-to-make-a-better-video-game-controller-1818823822">it began to feel like there were options</a> and I started experimenting with alternatives.</p> <p>Now, in the summer of 2025, it feels like <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamesir-tarantula-pro-controller-pc-switch-mobile-1851754990">a new controller is getting announced every other week,</a> and the rising prices of first-party hardware, as well as, on Switch 2, the still unimpressive quality of the console’s Joy-Con, makes comparing your choices a necessity. Let’s take a quick look at some of the newest entrants into the ever-more-chaotic marketplace for third-party controllers.</p> <h2>EasySMX S10 is a cheap Switch 2 Pro alternative</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617564"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617564">EasySMX</figcaption></figure> <p>Announced back in May, the <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx-s10-gaming-controller-for-switch-2-tmr-sticks-hd-rumble-motion-control?variant=44813624246460">EasySMX S10</a> pitches itself as a budget Switch 2 Pro controller. It’ll be $60 compared to the Pro Controller’s $90 and ships before the end of August. Like Nintendo’s premium controller, it can read Amiibo and wake the console up from sleep. The big features are a 1,000Hz polling rate for minimal latency and drift-resistant TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) Hall Effect joysticks. It’ll also support backwards compatibility with Switch 1 as well as gaming on PC and mobile. It’s a decent package at a compelling price point and I like the RGB-lit white version a lot, even with the ugly branded insignia on the side. But we won’t know if it can actually deliver until the first pre-orders begin arriving later this summer.</p>

 <h2>GameSir G7 Pro offers precision with weird caveats</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617563"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617563">Gamesir</figcaption></figure> <p>Another controller sporting TMR sticks is the <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-g7-pro">GameSir G7 Pro</a>. Announced more recently, it’s an $80 mid-tier option for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Android. It sports a nice look overall and a customizable three-piece magnetic faceplate, but the real draw are the mechanical micro switches that let you fine-tune the sensitivity of the triggers. But there’s a massive downside: it only works wired on console. There’s a long USB-C cable to keep you connected but it really cuts against the power efficiency of the TMR stick if you’re always connected anyway.</p> <h3>8BitDo Pro 3 upgrades what was already great</h3> <figure id="attachment_2000617567" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617567"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617567">8BitDo</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-3">The Pro 3</a> was revealed back in July and just started shipping this week. It looks like a PlayStation DualSense but with Nintendo’s style sensibility. The newest iteration of 8BitDo’s Pro line also sports extra buttons and TMR sticks. Most importantly, there’s a 2.4G adapter this time around for lower wireless latency. But my favorite feature by far is the pair of arcade-style ball-top caps that come in the box and can be attached to the Pro 3’s joysticks. It all comes in at the decent price of $70 and supports Switch 1, Switch 2, PC, Android, and iOS.</p> <h2>Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K spares no expense on PC</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617565" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617565"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617565">Razer</figcaption></figure> <p>If the above options were all looking a bit too affordable for you, Razer has just the thing. The <a href="https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-8k-pc">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K</a> is an esports-centric upgrade to last year’s model that promises ultra-responsiveness with TMR sticks and an 8000 Hz polling speed so the controller can register inputs faster than you can even think about them. It might be overkill, especially for a wireless model that costs $200, but it essentially has all of the bells and whistles from a top gaming keyboard shoved into a gamepad. There’s also a wired version for just $120.</p>

 <h2>Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is a luxury option for console</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617568"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617568">Victrix</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S and still want to pay more than double the price of a standard controller, Turtle Beach revealed the <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/victrix-pro-bfg-reloaded-wireless-controller">Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded</a> earlier this month. It promises 20 hours on a full charge and an extended wireless range with the option to plug in. More importantly, in addition to all the drift-resistant jazz that’s become table stakes at this level, the Pro BFG Reloaded is aimed specifically at fighting game players, with an “ergonomically optimized” resting position if you want to treat it like a mini-arcade stick. The whole kit costs $210.</p> <h2>WX5+ Wireless RGB looks cheap but fun</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617566">WX5+</figcaption></figure> <p>Enough of these 1-percenter gamepads. Let’s get back to the economy end of things. <a href="https://www.gioteck.com/products/wx5-wireless-rgb-controller-switch-2-doodles">The WX5+ Wireless</a> is essentially an upgraded version of the WX4 for the Switch 2, though it also works on PC. The Doodle variant comes with playful colors and RGB lighting. There’s hall-effect sticks, a rechargeable battery, and a headphone jack for plugging in your headset. The real standout for the Switch 2 controller, however, is the promise of a dedicated GameChat button that will bypass a bunch of the console’s menus to take you directly to talking with friends. It’s unclear if it’s just replicating what the Switch 2 Pro Controller does or speeding it up, but it’s neat either way. If it’s anything like the WX4 it’ll do just fine, especially at the low, low price of just $35.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since card companies and payment processors were urged to turn their collective eye of Sauron on Steam and Itch.io last month – resulting in <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mass deindexing of adult games</a> on the latter platform – a determined group of anti-censorship crusaders has been calling companies like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day in and day out</a>. This week, Stripe’s messaging around the topic seemed to change: Where before, reps had said the payment service does not support adult content, a few seem to have begun suggesting that LGBTQ content, adult or not, is also barred. Stripe has told Aftermath that those support team members were mistaken.</p><p>"We apologize: the information given by our support team was totally wrong,” a Stripe spokesperson said in a statement to Aftermath. “Stripe has no prohibitions on the sale of LGBTQ+ content or goods.”</p><p>Yesterday and today, a handful of Bluesky users <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mostlycogent.bsky.social/post/3lwaamhpcs22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> receiving confusing or offputting responses from support staff when inquiring about LGBTQ content. These posts quickly accrued thousands of reposts.</p><p>"Twice today, when pressured, Stripe operators have said, plainly, that I cannot use Stripe for the purchase of LGBTQ content,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3lwa2ig3o4s2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> Dieselbrain, a former artist and active member of the call campaign who’s created resources to help others. “Not just adult content, but explicitly LGBTQ."</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, they explained how their conversation with a Stripe support team member took that unexpected turn: “There was a bit of back and forth, and at some point I mention how it's not just [affecting] adult content, but also safe-for-work LGBT content. The operator then says that adult and LGBT content are not allowed to be purchased using Stripe. Hearing that surprises me, so I then ask more directly if I can use Stripe to purchase LGBT content. No mention of adult [content]; I'm just focusing on LGBT now. And the operator confirms that I cannot use Stripe to purchase LGBT content and then says something along the lines of this being Stripe's right to do so as a private business."</p><p>Today, <a href="https://transnews.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trans News Network’s Mady Castigan</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madycast.com/post/3lwciacse6s2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted audio of a call</a> that was particularly telling: A support team member, seemingly confused by a question about whether or not LGBTQ content is allowed, first suggests that Stripe does not allow LGBTQ content, but then steps away to double check. When she returns, she clarifies that “abusive behavior” is banned, “but there is not, like, a specific target for the LGBT."</p><p>Others <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/barilleon.com/post/3lwcbjwxrfc2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have claimed</a> that they wound up on calls with support team members who became exasperated upon hearing that people believed LGBTQ content was being specifically targeted.</p><p>"I wanna be clear about something," Dieselbrain <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3lwchkmwplk2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted today</a>. "We don't know Stripe's actual policy. These were statements by tier 1 call reps. They are worrying statements, especially since multiple people have experienced them, but this is not the same thing as conclusive proof that Stripe has an anti-LGBT policy on the books. It's a Bad Look but not the same as confirmed policy."</p><p>In Stripe’s statement to Aftermath, the company spokesperson concluded: “We're looking into this and making sure future inquiries are answered correctly."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-response"><h3>Krafton Responds To Subnautica 2 Lawsuit, Doubling Down On Claims That Executives ‘Abandoned’ Development</h3></a><p>Krafton lawyers say the lawsuit is over ‘a multimillion-dollar payday [the former executives] haven’t earned’</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/stripe-lgbtq-steam-itch-adult-games-delisted]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i> is a relaxing and unique entry in the <i>Mario </i>universe. This puzzle platformer is well worth checking out for genre fans or newcomers eager to see what all the treasure-hunting fuss is about. The game values your time while also being as quirky and adorable as you’d expect from anything featuring everyone’s favorite mushroom-headed pal. Even better, it features the option for two-player co-op, making it perfect for playing with kids or enjoying as a date-night activity.</p> <p>But whether you’re diving into this puzzle adventure alone or with a friend, you’re likely wondering how long it’ll take to beat <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i> and whether or not you’ll see any meaningful upgrades when playing on the Switch 2. Let’s take a look.</p> <h2>How does <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker </i>run on Switch 2?</h2> <p><i>Captain Toad</i> was one of several games to receive a much-appreciated <i>free</i> update to improve performance. Both portable and docked mode receive a bump up in resolution, resulting in a sharper image. There’s no improvement to the framerate, but the original already ran at a pretty reliable 60 frames-per-second. You can observe some direct differences between the OG Switch and Switch 2 <a href="https://youtu.be/0L8GMsUtl9k?t=1455">versions here</a>:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Switch 2 Free Upgrades For Switch 1 Games Tested: Link's Awakening, Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3 +More!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0L8GMsUtl9k?start=1455&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i>?</h2> <p>Due to the laid-back nature of <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i>, it’s tough to say just how long it’ll take each person to beat. There’s so much to do, after all. But the game doesn’t make you feel ina rush to get it all done. So, with that in mind, it can be a lot of fun to take your time and explore each level at your own pace, checking each nook and cranny for gems and completing challenges.</p> <p>If you’re not too interested in fully mastering each stage, however, <b>you’ll probably land at around 7-10 hours of playtime in </b><b><i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i></b>. That’s a decent amount of time for a puzzle platformer experience, and it ensures that it never outstays its welcome so that you don’t end up burned out before seeing the conclusion.</p> <p><b>If you </b><b><i>do</i></b><b> opt to 100% </b><b><i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i></b><b>, though, you can stretch things out to around 20 hours</b>, especially if you’re not rushing through stages. And if you miss anything along the way, you’re free to jump back into any stage and wrap up challenges or finish collecting missed items.</p> <p>That being said, I’d forgive you for overlooking hidden away behind things sometimes, but I’m not sure I could forgive you for overlooking this charming treasure hunt. <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p><span>The </span><i><span>Mafia</span></i><span> series of games has always benefitted from a strong sense of time and place. As a Chinese immigrant, I’d often find ways to connect to these games, even if I didn’t directly associate with the focus on Italian crime families. From the Chinatown area in the first </span><i><span>Mafia</span></i><span> to the Triads in </span><i><span>Mafia II</span></i><span>, I always felt a sense of authenticity running through the series. </span><i><span>Mafia III</span></i><span>’s shift away from Italian-American protagonists to focus on a Black man navigating the racism of the criminal underworld in late-1960s America was perhaps most authentic of all, holding forces that still shape our society today up to the light and examining the violence inherent in them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The latest entry, </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>, has neither the immigrant perspective nor the racial tensions that underscored the previous games. Instead, class dynamics and the plight of workers are at the heart of the story it tells about the mob in 1904 Sicily. It’s bolstered by memorable characters and wonderfully authentic performances, though it’s dragged down by dated gameplay mechanics.</span></p> <p><span>The story follows Enzo Favara, a worker who one day hopes to find a better life in America by saving up enough money to buy his freedom. One day, the sulfur mine he toils in collapses, causing the death of his friend Gaetano underneath rubble. Themes of revolution and working class rights are front and center during</span><i><span> Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>’s opening hours.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617522"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617522">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After slaving away for meager pennies his entire life up until that point and witnessing Gaetano’s demise, Enzo finally musters up the courage to confront the mine underboss, II Merlo of the Spadaro crime family. Finding himself overpowered, Enzo manages to escape and unwittingly crosses into the territory of the Torrisi crime family. Il Merlo gives chase but the crime family’s Don, Bernardo Torrisi, saves Enzo just as he’s about to be finished off. The Don tells a fearful Il Merlo off as he was caught in Torrisi territory and risks being the spark that ignites a war between the two crime families. Sensing the Don’s influence and power, Enzo eventually accepts his offer to join the Torrisi crime family, seeing it as the golden ticket he’s been searching for to get out of the poor working conditions he grew up in.</span></p> <h2><span>Welcome to the family</span></h2> <p><span>After joining the family, it’s not long before Enzo finds himself at the opposite end of the labor struggle. Acting as an enforcer, he breaks up a union’s strike to keep order for the Don. It’s a fascinating juxtaposition that foreshadows Enzo’s dark descent into mob life, but this aspect feels a bit underbaked. Whereas the recent animated film </span><i><span>Transformers One</span></i><span> carried its concerns about exploited workers through to its stirring climax in a more explicit manner, </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, by contrast, uses those themes as more of a subtext for Enzo’s eventual realization that his involvement with the Torrisi family comes with its own kind of exploitation. A noble aim, but the way it’s executed, it feels as if </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> tosses these ideas and all their resonant power aside in favor of a more conventional, albeit well-told, crime story about trying to make it out and leave the life of crime behind for good.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Still, the story does eventually coalesce in a satisfactory way. As you progress, each of the Don’s requests get bloodier and more dangerous until Enzo realizes that he’s nothing but a means to an end, a tool just like any other worker. Ironically, before the end, Enzo learns that the path he’s chosen, which seemed one that might lead him to liberation and luxury, has only made his life much more limited than it likely would have been if he’d stayed in the mines.</span></p>

 <p><span>Enzo’s late friend Gaetano had a postcard his uncle had sent him from Empire Bay, </span><i><span>Mafia II</span></i><span>’s setting and a fictional recreation of East Coast metropolitan areas like New York City. In it, Gaetano’s uncle wrote that upon their arrival in the U.S., he’d feed them steak and eggs, a huge step up from the paltry bread rations they received while working in the mines. And as the years go by, Enzo still carries it with him, as a memento of his friend and the dream they shared, and as inspiration to achieve his goal of reaching America. It’s a powerful motivator for Enzo, and as he gets more and more pulled into the business, it takes on the poignant power of the unattainable. It also chips away at the hyper-masculine allure that mafia media tends to give its leading figures with shows of power, control, and dominance, allowing us to sympathize more with Enzo as the story progresses.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617523">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Ultimately, Enzo’s tale is a tragedy. Of course he has no knowledge that on the other side of the pond, Italian immigrants are also facing marginalization and poor economic conditions, driving some of them to join organized crime groups like the American mafia. Sure, a steak and eggs meal sounds nice, but not all that glitters is gold. Even if he did make it to American shores, Enzo could potentially find himself stuck in a similar situation in America, looking for a way out of organized crime again. No matter what path he takes or where he goes, he’ll always face insurmountable odds that keep him from living the carefree and rich life that he imagined. These strong narrative threads kept my interest in </span><i><span>The Old Country </span></i><span>from waning, turning its story into much more than just a series of cutscenes meant to support the middling gameplay moments in between. Through Enzo, we can see how he and so many others poured their blood, sweat, and tears into struggling to achieve a dream when it was really just a mere fantasy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Though the story has its ups and downs, it benefits throughout from the fantastic supporting cast and the stellar performances from the voice actors. Among the Torrisi crime family, the bold attitude of Enzo’s best buddy Cesare brings out the bloodthirstiness within our protagonist, while mentor Luca imparts wisdom to Enzo to make sure he doesn’t get in way over his head. The Don is the most stereotypically mob-like of the bunch, with his focus on family and loyalty over everything, but the interactions between the characters make them feel like more than just typical organized crime members.</span></p> <p><span>In the English track, all of the voice actors speak in heavy Italian accents, but not in a way that feels insultingly stereotypical or harmful. In fact, it adds to the authenticity that the </span><i><span>Mafia </span></i><span>franchise is known for. The Sicilian dub is also excellent, and can heighten your immersion. Fair warning though, the characters’ lip-synching doesn’t match up nearly as well in that one as in the English dub.</span></p>

 <h2><span>Going back in time, in more ways than one</span></h2> <p><span>While the narrative and characters have their compelling qualities, when it comes to gameplay, every single aspect of </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> feels like something from the late 2000s or early 2010s. There’s just not much depth to any of it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617527">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are bog-standard stealth sequences akin to those in </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>. You just sneak up behind your enemies and then choke them out. Enzo even has his obligatory “radar” mode, called instinct mode, that lets him see enemies through walls. The dumb enemy AI doesn’t do these sections any favors either, as they stupidly fall for the coins and bottles that Enzo can throw as distractions. For a game with revolutionary themes, the stealth mechanics are anything but. To make matters worse, there are a few stealth sections that result in an instant game over if you get caught, and those are never fun.</span></p>

 <p><span>Then, of course, there are all-out gunfights, and the guns you get to use are fine for what they are. Your pick of the litter includes pistols, rifles, and shotguns–naturally there are none of </span><i><span>Mafia III</span></i><span>’s rocket launchers and C4 chargers here to really make things explosive. The gunplay itself plays out like your run-of-the-mill cover shooter</span><span>—</span><i><span>Uncharted</span></i><span>, for instance. In that game, as in this one, I would just duck in and out of cover to pop enemies in the head and continue on. Occasionally here in </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, a lone enemy might approach me or a grenade might be thrown to flush me out of my cover, but these were hardly any challenge (even on Hard difficulty) and didn’t really result in invigorating shootouts.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, there are the knife fights, which are usually reserved for cinematic moments and pit you against major antagonists. Though meant to be pivotal dramatic confrontations, in practice they’re quite underwhelming and mostly involve waiting for the boss to strike so you can parry them and slash back. I often found myself repeating this same strategy to win. You can also break your opponent’s guard, but in my experience the spacing never felt quite right. During the final boss fight I’d have a sizable distance between us, but my guard break attack would somehow always connect, even though it didn’t look like it did. Still, I took those victories in stride as I just wanted to get the whole thing over with.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>BACK-OF-THE-BOX QUOTE</p>                 <p>“A deal you probably can refuse.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>TYPE OF GAME</p>                 <p>Third-person narrative-driven action-adventure.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>LIKED</p>                 <p>Good story, great characters, culturally authentic.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>DISLIKED</p>                 <p>Dated gameplay, half-assed open world.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>DEVELOPER</p>                 <p>Hangar 13</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLATFORMS</p>                 <p>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S (played)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>RELEASE DATE</p>                 <p>August 8, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLAYED</p>                 <p>About 18 hours. Cleared the game on hard difficulty.

The biggest issue with this option is that while there are some landmarks here and there that you can take photos of, there’s not much else to do besides go around and pick up collectibles. There are no side quests or mini-games to participate in. This is a weird thing to say given that </span><i><span>Mafia III</span></i><span> was criticized for its open-world bloat and </span><i><span>Mafia:</span></i> <i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>’s streamlined approach is welcome. The open world is an unnecessary half-measure; the game should have leaned even more fully into a linear structure similar to </span><i><span>Max Payne 3</span></i><span>-style mission design and done away with the option to tool around its lifeless, uninteresting world altogether.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>’s story was good enough to keep me engaged to the end with its authentic portrayal of 1900s Sicily and its superb characters. It’s too bad, however, that while the narrative traveled backwards in time for its new setting, the gameplay mechanics went along with them.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Black Ops 7 is fighting to stay relevant as the worldwide reveal approaches. On August 19, during the Opening Night Live showcase, Activision’s studios will unveil Black Ops 7 beyond what they’ve already shown, hopefully contending for their slice of the FPS pie and wrangling attention away from Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In a series of new leaks that have emerged on social media, prominent Call of Duty insider TheGhostofHope has revealed a slew of information about the upcoming shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-are-coming-back-in-black-ops-7">What Maps Are Coming Back in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p>According to TheGhostofHope, Black Ops 7 will launch with three remastered maps pulled from 2012’s Black Ops II:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raid</li>



<li>Express</li>



<li>Hijacked</li>
</ul>



<p>The post containing the remastered maps tidbit came after a claim that Specialist abilities will return for Black Ops 7. This mechanic hasn’t been seen since Black Ops 4, and it simply allows players to pick from characters or classes that have a unique ability. As GhostofHope puts it, this could be ‘active camo, grapple hook, and more.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Thanks to the Black Ops 7 title reveal at the Xbox Game Showcase in June, we already knew that active camo is a thing in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>GhostofHope went on to explain that Black Ops 7’s larger-than-life multiplayer mode, which will be akin to the recent outings of ‘Ground War’ is apparently ‘<strong>trash</strong>‘. They also mentioned that a wingsuit appears in this mode, given that it will unfold over much larger maps than those seen in traditional multiplayer playlists.</p>



<p>What do you think of these latest Black Ops 7 leaks? Are you excited about remastered maps and perhaps want more? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steamforged has announced a new <em>Warmachine</em> starter set for pre-order. The aptly named <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em> set introduces two new forces from western Immoren. One alive; the other long dead.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em> Starter Set Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its store page, the <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em>&nbsp;starter set contains two Command Cadres, both of which are solid starting points for a brand-new <em>Warmachine</em> army.

The once ruthless, silent killers of the Shard Spires now fight to preserve their dying culture. They are led by a lesser warlock, Lanyssa Ryssyl, and are bonded to lethal warbeasts. Sasha and Benkei.</p>

<p>The second Command Cadre in the <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em> starter set is the Orgoth Graveborn. These immortal horrors are led by a deathless warlord called Anathia, the Imperishable Desolation. These terrors continue on the warpath, fighting to reclaim the glories of their first conquest.</p>

<p>The starter set contains the following units:</p>

<ul><li>Lanyssa Ryssyl (Dusk Lesser Warlock)</li>
	<li>Cylena Raefyll (Dusk Character Solo)</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Of The Worst-Reviewed Games On Switch 2 Come From Nintendo]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-worst-games-nintendo-metacritic-drag-x-drive-welcome-tour-2000617517</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-of-the-worst-reviewed-games-on-switch-2-come-from-nintendo.1269573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Reviews for <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-drag-x-drive-demo-joy-con-jeans-table-mouse-2000616850"><em>Drag x Drive</em>,</a> Nintendo’s newest first-party Switch 2 game, went live across the web earlier today, and the overall consensus seems to be: Meh. By itself, that wouldn’t be much of a story, but <em>Drag x Drive’</em>s low review scores mean that two out of the five lowest-rated Switch 2 games on Metacritic were published by Nintendo.</p> <p>On August 13, the embargo dropped for<em> Drag x Drive</em> reviews, and numerous outlets began posting their critical appraisals of the arcade-y wheelchair basketball game. <em>Drag x Drive</em>, which launches on Thursday, isn’t a big hit with critics. Many found it too complicated for casual players, but not deep enough to keep experienced players hooked. Others complained that the controls, which rely heavily on the new Joy-Cons’ mouse functionality, are tedious and a pain to use, and even once you’ve mastered them, the 3v3 sports game is just not very exciting to play or look at. So it’s not a surprise that, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/nintendo-switch-2/all/all-time/metascore/?releaseYearMin=1958&amp;releaseYearMax=2025&amp;platform=nintendo-switch-2&amp;page=2">as of 2:30 PM EST</a>, <em>Drag x Drive</em> has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/">lukewarm 62 out of 100 rating on Metacritic</a> and places it in close proximity to another Nintendo-published Switch 2 game.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828">That other game is Switch 2 launch title <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour,</em></a> a game that many critics called a glorified tutorial and tech demo hidden behind a paywall. And while it has some fans, it boasts a low overall Metacritic score of 54. Yikes. That score places it right next to <em>Drag x Drive</em> on the worst-reviewed Switch 2 games list on Metacritic. The only game with a worse aggregated score than those two titles is Bandai Namco’s <em>Tamagotchi Plaza.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>So what can we take from this? Well, first off, it should be noted that over the next few months and years, as more games flood the Switch 2, I expect these low-rated Nintendo games to float higher up the list as truly awful garbage lands on the console. But for now, I think it reinforces the fact that the Switch 2 is a great console with perhaps the worst launch line-up of exclusive games I’ve seen from Nintendo in a long time.</p> <p>It’s also interesting that both of these poorly received Nintendo games are new titles not connected to a franchise and focused heavily on the more gimmicky features of the Switch 2 hardware. In 2025, it seems a lot of critics and players are done waggling controllers or caring about weird features that very few games will use at all. That’s bad news for <em>Drag x Drive</em> and<em> Welcome Tour,</em> but it suggests that Nintendo made the right call with its new console. Instead of going for a new, weird gimmick like the Wii U, Virtual Boy, or 3DS, this time around Nintendo just made the same console again, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">but bigger, better, and faster.</a> Seeing how <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">well it has sold so far</a> and how poorly people are reacting to gimmicks, this was likely a smart move.</p>

                <p>The storytellers behind Blizzard's Story and Franchise Development team have decided to unionize. Following the results of a union-authorization vote, Blizzard's SFD will now join the Communications Workers of America in Orange County, California. Additionally, Microsoft has voluntarily recognized the SFD team's union vote.</p><p>There have been two previous unionization votes at Blizzard in the past year. In July 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-has-unionized/1100-6525284/" data-ref-id="1100-6525284">the developers behind World of Warcraft voted to unionize</a> and joined CWA. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">Overwatch 2 team passed a similar vote in May 2025</a>, and also joined CWA.</p><p>One of the SFD union organizers, Buddy Fisk, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared a statement through CWA</a> citing the increasingly frequent layoffs in the video game industry as a driving force behind this vote.</p><p>"After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I've seen all the highs and lows," said Fisk. "For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability's been fading. With a union, we're able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone."</p><p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft</a> last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-rumble-will-receive-no-new-content-amidst-layoffs-at-blizzard/1100-6532929/" data-ref-id="1100-6532929">Blizzard lost many members of the team dedicated</a> to the mobile game Warcraft Rumble. Across Microsoft as a whole, approximately 9,000 jobs were lost.</p><p>Earlier this month, Diablo general manager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">Rod Fergusson announced his departure from Blizzard</a> after spending half a decade with the company. Blizzard has also signaled some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-making-big-changes-to-how-it-talks-to-the-diablo-4-community/1100-6533773/" data-ref-id="1100-6533773">changes to the way it interacts with Diablo 4 fans in Campfire Chats</a>. Additionally, Blizzard president Johanna Faries hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-says-more-tv-shows-and-movies-are-possible/1100-6530062/" data-ref-id="1100-6530062">more TV and movies based on the studio's franchises</a> may eventually be made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">My first Evo was all the way back in 2003, when it was held at Cal Poly Pomona. It was a ragtag yet passionate operation where a bunch of weirdos crammed into one of the university's big halls to play fighting games and watch the best of the best from across North America (and the Japanese players they convinced to come attend) duke it out. There were a bunch of PlayStation 2 consoles and arcade machines, a few projection screens, and some seats if you wanted to either watch or play some games. There were no ads or major announcements--the entertainment during downtime consisted of fan-made combo videos and somebody playing the overhead levels of Contra III. Despite all of the tech hiccups and the obvious drive to run things as cheaply as possible, we all <em>loved</em> it there.</p><p dir="ltr">Never would I have dreamed that, almost a quarter-century later, Evo would become one of gaming's most-talked-about annual events: a celebration of love and community in fighting games that even people not really into the genre would tune in to watch online. Evo now occupies an entire, massive hall in the Las Vegas Convention Center, where thousands of players from around the world come for a chance to compete and share their passion for fighting games in a variety of ways--be it entering tournaments, running side events, drawing and selling art in the Artists Alley, cosplaying, or just playing casual sets all day with people they've never met before. In a way, the main Evo event has morphed from a tournament into a full-blown fighting game convention, where the tournaments are now just a major part of the show, not necessarily the sole reason why many of the people are there.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But with that rapid growth has come a massive price tag. If you didn't purchase admission early, a weekend competition pass to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/evo-2025-everything-announced-at-the-annual-three-day-fighting-game-fest/2900-6841/" data-ref-id="2900-6841">Evo 2025</a> was around $250, plus $10 for each of the official tournament games you wanted to enter. If you paid early and just wanted to watch or play casuals with other attendees, that would still set you back $180. That's not taking into account all of the other expenses: gas or airfare to get to Las Vegas, and then lodging, transportation, food once you're there. And that doesn't take into account a bunch of other miscellaneous expenses you might unexpectedly run into (Is your joystick bag too big? That's a checked-bag fee). Sure, there are ways to cut costs--the tried-and-true method of cramming a gaggle of people into a single hotel room is a favorite--but oftentimes they can wind up costing just as much or more. Staying at a cheaper hotel that's farther away from the LVCC? The moment you step into 105-degree Vegas summer heat, you're going to ditch the idea of walking and get a Lyft instead.</p><p dir="ltr">While Evo was just as lively this year as it was in 2024--and much better-run in general--several people I know who were usually reliable event attendees weren't there. In fact, the majority of the faces I saw frequently from attending weekly and monthly Portland-area fighting game gatherings didn't go to Evo. For some, a big reason was work or life conflicts, but even when those were factors, another thing always came up:<strong> "It's just too expensive."</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And it's not just Evo that's priced out of reach, either--a lot of big fighting game events have become quite costly to attend. My partner and I went to Combo Breaker in the Chicago suburbs in 2023 and had a fantastic time. We'd love to go back, but for us, it's almost as expensive as Evo. I'd like to attend Community Effort Orlando, but that's both an expensive outing and an extremely long flight from the Pacific Northwest. I can only afford to attend one big fighting game event per year, so I need to pick wisely.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't always like this. Fighting games are viewed as something of a "working class" esport. Many beloved players over the years have come from distinctly less-privileged backgrounds: inspirational tales of kids who had to get good at fighters because they wanted to make their quarters in the arcade last longer, or because they only had a few games for their console. Top players in all games have emerged from places all across the globe. The great class equalizer is "How well can you hit your buttons?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549280"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite this, it's extremely hard for many players to be able to join these big competitions. Incredible players in many regions--including North America itself--are simply unable to come and compete on the global stage due to prices of travel, lodging, and tournament entry. Depending on your nationality, you might have a long, arduous, and expensive visa process before you can come and play anywhere else besides your home country--and you're not necessarily guaranteed approval. (It's a minor miracle that the Pakistani Tekken champions managed to get to their first Evo events at all a few years back.) For many talented but unknown players without sponsorships, these obstacles are exceptionally difficult to surmount.</p><p dir="ltr">Big tournaments can be an even harder sell if you're just a typical fighting game player. Statistically, you're probably not going to win Evo and recoup any prize money. In fact, you're very likely to go 0-2 in a major game. And most folks know that, so essentially, you're paying for a fun weekend with other fighting game nerds. But how much is the average fighting game player willing or able to pay for that experience when they can just go online to find people to spar against?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549319" data-ratio="0.56164383561644" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549319"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's true that many younger fighting game players have likely grown through online competition, but many players also value the in-person, communal aspect of fighting games. But local options for smaller in-person meets and tournaments can be limited depending on where you live. Running even a small fighting game event can put you at a financial risk--event spaces don't come cheap, especially when internet packages are factored in (since events are generally expected to be livestreamed). Perhaps, if you're lucky, you can find a place willing to provide you some space at a discount--some of the monthly fighting game gatherings here in Portland happen at card and tabletop game stores and bars. Then you'll likely discover that being a Tournament Operator is a tiring, often thankless position. Many who try to establish local events go into burnout after a short while--it takes a certain mentality and dedication to make this work consistently, and not everyone can manage it.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to this, there's been a severe decrease in the number of established, moderately sized fighting game events over the past several years. As Evo and other big fighting game events increase in price, more affordable mid-size regionals like SoCal and NorCal Regionals, Kumite in Tennessee, and East Coast Throwdown have vanished. Some of these events were put on pause during COVID and never came back. Some grew too big for the hotel and college student-union ballrooms they were hosted in but weren't big enough to afford a convention space. Some went away because the organizers were just exhausted or needed to move on with life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549320" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549320"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the players who do have the means to attend the big events--either out of pocket or through sponsorships--tend to have an advantage. Events like the Capcom World Tour, the Tekken World Tour, and the SNK World Championship offer massive prize pots, but getting into these events often means entering as many big qualifiers as possible--which requires travel, and that requires money. And the sponsors are only willing to pay for events that look like good investments--meaning those small- and mid-size tournaments that are around struggle to bring in non-local top players that could encourage more people to attend.</p><p dir="ltr">This situation doesn't just hurt the players, but those who enjoy watching the games, too. Everyone loves seeing underdogs and/or new blood do well--just look at how many hearts the young Micky won over in his third-place Street Fighter 6 run at Evo this year. But think about the many other talented players out there we don't even know about who <em>could</em> have similar amazing performances on those grand stages. They can't, because the hurdles are too much to overcome.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4549321" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4549321"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">What can be done to fix this? It's difficult to come up with a clear solution, but there are ideas. Many publishers already hold online qualifiers for some of their big events, though there are caveats--in some cases, you still have to worry about your travel and lodging costs. The idea of global online tournaments is shaky, since even the most robust rollback netcode can buckle under the weight of a cross-continental journey--or even just shoddy Wi-Fi.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the publishers and hardware-makers themselves could help. Helping sponsor some smaller, local events in metro areas would be a step forward in community engagement, and could lay the groundwork for bigger, better events moving forward. Maybe a community "scholarship" fund could be established to help promising players afford travel to big events and make their mark. Maybe we can offer discounted event passes in some cases. I'm really just spitballing here, but it's clear that if we don't start to nip this problem in the bud, it could do lasting damage to the soul of the fighting game community.</p><p dir="ltr">While I had a fantastic time at Evo 2025 and am glad to see how far it's come, it also feels like it's veering in an alarming direction. The eye-rolling Chipotle ad placements are one thing--of course the commercial element is going to have to come in when the payouts get big. Rather, it's the fact that so many people I know won't or can't go to Evo anymore. Evo used to be where you went because all of your fighting game friends from everywhere would be there, together, for that one weekend of the year. But Evo and other big tournaments are feeling more and more exclusive. Fighting games should be open to everyone, and we need to make the path to potential glory as wide as possible.</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: Origins was the start of a long-running and beloved series at BioWare, but it wasn't always meant to be. Former executive producer Mark Darrah, who worked for BioWare from 1998 through 2022, said that the game was conceived as a standalone story, and that you can still see that intent in some unresolved story threads.</p><p>"Dragon Age: Origins originally was intended as a standalone game," Darrah told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">MrMattyPlays</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-wasnt-meant-to-be-a-series-says-former-bioware-executive-producer-and-thats-why-origins-was-full-of-storylines-that-had-to-be-abandoned/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). "You can see this, if you play Dragon Age: Origins, knowing that it was intended to stand alone. There's a lot of threads that are cast out that kind of had to be abandoned because there could be werewolves all over the world, there might be a civil war happening underground in Orzammar." He said those elements were good for world-building but were difficult to deal with as an ongoing series.</p><p>Dragon Age became known as BioWare's fantasy series alongside the sci-fi Mass Effect. Both had ongoing stories that respected your earlier choices, including the ability to import your saves from Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2 into the third game, Dragon Age: Inquisition. Or, you could customize a set of pre-set choices to build the world of Thedas to your liking. But accounting for all those choices in the third game meant that they could only be so impactful while still telling new original stories, because the studio hadn't counted on needing to pay off every decision from Origins into later games. Then Origins was a success, and the company was inclined to iterate with sequels.</p><p>"It's pretty much financial reasons more than anything," says Darrah. "And I think that the franchise has been much more forward-looking ever since then."</p><p>The latest game in the series, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, had limited connections to previous games in the series, and didn't import saves from previous games or otherwise take your choices into account. It was mostly a standalone story, rather than one that accounted for all your previous adventures in Thedas. Darrah said that EA has pushed for Dragon Age to become more of a mainstream series.</p><p>"The problem that Dragon Age has had, charitably I guess, is that EA wants mainstream success," Darrah said, "and it's hard, or at least it has historically been hard, for corporate people, people who come from the sports side of the organization to look at a game like Dragon Age: Origins, which is super nerdy, not very attractive looking, and say 'Oh, this is a mainstream game.' They don't see it."</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was generally well-received, with an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 82 on Metacritic</a> and our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">GameSpot review calling it a return to form</a>. But the discourse online has been divisive, with some fans expressing disappointment with the lack of narrative choices and narrowly designed world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> emerged late last year as an unlikely winner amid a sea of failed live-service slop. What made the free-to-play hero shooter succeed where others hadn’t? Was it the well-oiled gameplay loop, the massive comic book IP behind it, or the steady flow of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1moiozw/its_the_details_for_me/">gooner skins</a> for iconic characters like Emma Frost? Following the recent addition of swimsuits, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>‘ creative director was finally asked what he thinks about the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1hwovkd/me_a_overwatch_gooner_seeing_marvel_rivals_get/"><em>Overwatch</em> for gooners”</a> discourse.</p> <p>“Because our design, as mentioned earlier, is inspired by classic comic themes, including some very outstanding skins, like Mantis, and also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1mb18r8/its_phenomenal_that_psylocke_is_the_only_hero_in/">Psylocke’s Vengeance</a>, these all come from classic comic designs,” Guangyun Chen told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivalsAssembled">YouTube channel RivalsAssembled</a> at a recent tournament in China. “We take those classic comic designs and make some more fashionable designs based on them to gain players’ appreciation. I think this also reflects the broad recognition from our players.”</p> <p>While Chen is right that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is drawing upon <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-marvel-swimsuit-special-returns-friends-foes-rivals-july-2025">a well-established history of hyper-sexualized designs</a>, especially when it comes to female characters, every batch of skins usually includes at least a handful that suggest the NetEase studio knowns exactly what it’s doing. For example, fans instantly noticed when a pair of X-suit skins back in April buffed the butts of both Psylocke and Magik.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="EXCLUSIVE: Matchmaking Explained, Playable Villains ARE Coming, more Vanguards and Strategists" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-_8Qj3spOM?start=707&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“As mentioned earlier with the Squirrel Girl and the Krakoa Resort skin, these are actually designs based on real-world themes and the season’s storyline,” Chen continued without cracking a smile. “For designs like these, we try our best to integrate the storylines from the season, including elements from Krakoa, and also blend some popular elements from real life. We create new designs based on that, and I’m very grateful these designs have been well-received by the majority of players.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1m5ysiw/reminder_that_this_skin_is_not_part_of_the_marvel/">Sunshine Squirrel</a> is by far one of the tamer skins <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has released this summer, however. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-skins/2900-6764/#10">The first batch of swimsuit outfits</a> put both Psylocke and Luna Snow in tiny bikinis. Evening out the fan-service, however, was both Loki and The Punisher in speedos. Even The <em>Fantastic Four</em>‘s Thing was airing himself out. I’m sure all of these designs were implemented with only the highest ideals of fashion and authenticity to the source material top of mind.</p> <p>In the meantime, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has more pressing issues to attend to. The game’s rating on Steam is plummeting under an influx of complaints about allegedly manipulative matchmaking. The developers say that’s not the case, though, promising to brief players on all things related to matchmaking <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-eomm-steam-reviews-max-payne-remake-n64-2000617137">in an upcoming developer video</a>.</p>
