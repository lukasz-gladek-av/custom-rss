		<p>FBC Firebreak, the 3v3 co-op shooter set in the Control universe, blasted onto the scene a few short months ago, and while it was relatively well-received, the team at Remedy have set out to make sure it reaches its full potential with the game’s first major new update, coming under the title Breakpoint. This massive update includes various new improvements, including new missions, additional gun mods and a host of new enemies to blast to smithereens.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Breakpoint Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFx8yMOC67w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the update trailer, Breakpoint really does look like it takes the game up a notch, and the idiosyncratic action of Firebreak looks better than ever before. The key changes and additions that the team have made are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Playable Crisis</b>&nbsp;– Outbreak: A mission set in the Research Sector where Firebreakers face a dangerous Mold infestation, new enemies, and unique challenges.</li>
<li><b>Crisis Board</b>&nbsp;– A redesigned structure that replaces the Job Board, delivering curated missions with more dynamic and unpredictable play.</li>
<li><b>Gun Mods</b> – 27 weapon modifiers that add customisation, power, and flexibility to every loadout.</li>
<li><b>Expanded Arsenal</b>&nbsp;– Three new heavy weapons and three new grenades for added firepower and tactical depth.</li>
<li><b>New Threats –</b>&nbsp;Five additional enemies, including Mold-specific foes and new Hiss enemies with variants.</li>
<li><b>Economy &amp; Progression Overhaul</b>&nbsp;– Gear is now fully powered upon unlocking, and currencies have been streamlined for a clearer, more rewarding experience.</li>
<li><b>Improved Onboarding</b>&nbsp;– A new tutorial, orientation videos, and redesigned early-game flow make it easier for new players to join the fight.</li>
<li><b>Gameplay Improvements</b>&nbsp;– More impactful augments and devices, improved harmful condition visuals, better survivability options, and full Crisis Kit access from level one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remedy have said that they’re going to continue to expand <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> with further, completely free updates. The next major Update, codenamed “Rogue Protocol”, will arrive in late November 2025, introducing a brand-new game mode and much-requested cross-platform voice chat to strengthen teamwork. A balance and tuning update will then follow in December, before another Major Update is currently planned for March 2026, which will add new content to the game, including a new Crisis Kit.</p>
<p>Tef <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">quite liked Firebreak FBC at launch</a>, but he felt it still had a ways to go, saying, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>

<p>With Breakpoint, it really feels like Remedy are addressing some of those issues, and here’s hoping that it’ll bring even more people into the Firebreak fold. As part of that, the game is 40% off on Steam from today, so if you’ve been on the fence about jumping in, now is the perfect time to.</p>

<p>"I find myself torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="14da3b0318c97"><a title="FF7 Remake - Cloud" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14da3b0318c97/ff7-remake-cloud.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> will finally make its way onto the Switch 2 early next year on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>For many, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">1997 original</a> stands as one of the most iconic games of all time, and it's certainly up there as one of the best entries in the long-running series. For Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of the Remake Trilogy (of which the latter two entries have also been confirmed for Switch 2), tackling such a monumental project comes with its own sense of pressure.</p>
<p>Speaking via an <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-interview">internal interview at Square Enix</a>, Hamaguchi-san says that he finds himself "torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis", but nevertheless finds the whole thing a "worthwhile challenge" to undertake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Final Fantasy VII has always been a special game for me. When it was originally released, I was simply another player immersed in it and I was strongly drawn to the story of Cloud and Sephiroth. The game opened my eyes to the power of storytelling, something that’s stayed with me ever since. I feel it’s still at the core of what I do as a creator.</p>
<p>"I am now in the position of where I interact with Final Fantasy VII on the creative side and am working hard to bring Remake Intergrade to multiple new platforms and deliver the FFVII experience to even more people. I’m also right in the middle of developing the third and final part of the trilogy, the final phase where we bring the series to an epic conclusion - and a fitting culmination of everything in Final Fantasy VII.</p>
<p>"Because Final Fantasy VII is a game that fans have such a strong attachment to, I find myself torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis. I feel a great responsibility to get it right. However, I believe this also makes it a worthwhile challenge to take on.</p>
<p>"Personally, I feel that the essence of Final Fantasy VII is the freedom to mix together many different elements and not get caught up in the restrictions of a single genre. How to bring that to the current generation is the challenge I’ve set myself at the moment."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the reception so far, we reckon Hamaguchi-san and his team have been doing a pretty good job on the trilogy. If you've not played Remake yet, you're in for a treat when it lands early next year. It seems that it'll run remarkably well on Nintendo's new console too, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman recently stating that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">"the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2"</a>.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and the untitled third entry, there's no indication as to when they'll release on the Switch 2, but you can bet we'll be keeping a close eye on any potential developments in the coming months.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-between-ai-pivot-and-20-billion-of-debt.1312189/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just a few days <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the original rumor</a>, Electronic Arts (EA) confirmed yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it is indeed getting a $55 billion buyout</a> from a Consortium of investors that includes PIF, Saudi Arabia's sovereign investment fund, Silver Lake (an American global private equity firm), and Affinity Partners, an American investment firm founded in 2021 by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of current United States president Donald Trump.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has started to settle, though, the first reports from reputable sources suggest that there might be massive layoffs on the way at EA, and it's not just history suggesting that after what happened with Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. According to a paywalled report <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by the Financial Times</a>, the investors from the aforementioned Consortium are planning to use the latest AI advancements to cut EA's operating costs and manage its substantial debt, suggesting a potential shift towards incorporating AI in games and therefore reducing manpower, both when it comes to development teams and acting talent.</p>



<p>Speaking about that debt, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/ea-agrees-to-sale-in-largest-leveraged-buyout-on-record?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg's report</a> reveals that this deal is partly funded by $20 billion in debt sourced by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. This is the most significant debt commitment ever registered for a buyout. Moreover, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonschreier_ea-agrees-to-55-billion-sale-in-largest-activity-7378438808637243392-QqT5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a LinkedIn post from Bloomberg's Schreier</a>, they will be put on the books of EA:</p>



<p><em>That will mean a significant amount of cost-cutting. I would expect mass layoffs, more aggressive monetization, and many other measures. The interest alone could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars per year. For context: this is nearly four times as much debt as the Toys R Us LBO, and I think everyone knows how that went.</em></p>



<p>This is very worrying, especially for EA employees. One studio that might be targeted in case of mandated cost-cutting measures is BioWare, which did not deliver a financially successful game with Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Canadian developer already suffered some layoffs and, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had fewer than a hundred employees left</a>. Hopefully, they will get one last chance with the next Mass Effect game.</p>



<p>Former CEO and co-founder of analyst firm SuperData, Joost van Dreunen, also chimed in on the massive $55 billion deal, the second biggest in gaming history (after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard) and the biggest buyout of all time, topping the $48.4 billion buyout of TXU Energy in 2007. <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/electronic-arts-55b-buyout-doesnt?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his SuperJoost Playlist Substack newsletter</a>, the games analyst focused specifically on PIF. The Saudi Arabian private investment fund already owned roughly 10% of EA's shares, which made their part of the transaction less onerous. Even so, the analyst says their strategy is to 'throw staggering amounts of money at establishing market dominance', and given that they have nearly infinite investment resources, it may well succeed. </p>



<p>Van Dreunen also posits that private companies are generally better insulated than public companies when it comes to market pressure, so the new owners of Electronic Arts could technically forego short-term profits in favor of the long-term view. However, PIF is not the only one in the Consortium - Silver Lake and Affinity Partners may hold a different mindset.</p>

            <p>Riot Games has released a gameplay trailer for Teemo, the 10th character coming to 2XKO. This trailer, which introduces the infamous Yordle Scout to the fighting game genre, presents him with a cute and jubilant aesthetic as well as an absolutely rancid moveset.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Teemo is a beloved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> champion that was part of that game's base roster all the way back in 2009. Known for his blow pipe and frustrating shenanigans, he's been recreated in 2XKO with a lot of his trademark moves and more.</p>
<p>As you can see below, Teemo is coming with a new stage alongside the game's Early Access launch on the 7th October. This stage in the release schedule for 2XKO will also mark the introduction of the game's first season as well as the final content reset for the game, meaning anything earned is yours forever.</p>

<p>This trailer shows a fighting game character designed by maniacs. Teemo has various projectiles, a brush you can teleport to, poison and flame effects, mushrooms he can throw out that stick on the screen and provide him ample cover. He can also delay his fall speed to bait out anti-air attacks from his opponent.</p><p>One of Teemo's supers brings out a giant mushroom that bounces whimsily towards his opponent and while being projectile invulnerable, which is nasty work. Oh and he can turn himself invisible too for a short period of time, which is really just the cherry on top of a nightmarish monster of a character.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds negative you're forgiven for thinking so, but the truth is that this is exactly what Teemo should be like when brought over to a fighting game. To live up to his character in League of Legends where he was first let loose on the world, he needs to strike that balance between cute and utterly infuriating. Anyways, it probably won't be that hard to play against… Just block, bud.</p>

            <p>Sony has released a revised digital PS5 model in Europe, with less storage and a new matte finish - but the price hasn't been reduced.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, reliable insider <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">Billbil-Kun</a> reported the digital-only model of the PS5 would receive a downgrade from 1TB of storage to 825GB. This model went on sale in Europe this month - and crucially costs the same (€499) despite less storage.</p>
<p>Now, a new unboxing video on YouTube from Austin Evans confirms the storage downgrade, as well as the use of cheaper parts, based on a new console purchased from Germany.</p>

<p>Both the black central casing of the console and the white outer sleeves now come in a matte finish rather than a glossy finish - no more fingerprints!</p>
<p>The newer console is also 100g lighter than the previous slim version - and 1.3kg lighter than the launch model.</p>
<p>As for the SSD, the actual amount of usable storage on the newer model is 667.2GB (compared with 848.0GB of usable space on the previous model). That's a 27 percent reduction and not a huge amount of space, especially considering this is a digital-only model</p>
<p>Inside, the fan is lighter, plus the motherboard design has been refined and is thinner.</p>
<p>While Evans notes the internal engineering is excellent in maintaining the same power and performance, ultimately the reduced SSD makes this iteration of the console considerably worse.</p>
<p>For Sony, it's presumably cheaper to make. But that saving has not been passed on to the consumer, considering all PS5 consoles cost more now than ever.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of the digital edition in the UK and mainland Europe</a> from £390/€450 to £430/€500. And this was the second price increase, as it originally cost £359.99/€399.99 at launch, meaning the digital edition is €100 more than five years ago.</p><p>More recently, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-price-of-ps5-ps5-digital-and-ps5-pro-in-the-us">price of all versions of the console went up in the US</a> as the company continues to "navigate a challenging economic environment". It's unclear yet if the revised version of the console with storage reduction will be available in the US as in Europe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ah, Advance Wars. Now <em>there</em> was a perfect strategy game. While we have had an Advance Wars game in recent memory, it wasn’t really a new one, not least because developer Intelligent Systems seem far too busy Fire Embleming to fit one in. So, it falls to other teams to advance the armed forces side of the tactical strategy genre. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/03/tiny-metal-review/">Tiny Metal</a> was certainly a decent first attempt, but with its full sequel, the team at Area 35, Inc. are looking to bring the genre hurtling like a cannon shell into the modern day.</p>
<p><iframe title="TINY METAL 2 Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y7bFiHvjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That fundamentally means a complete reworking of the visuals. This is what an Advance Wars game should look like in 2025, and the stylised anime-style visuals retain a hand-drawn roughness that makes it feel more like it’s a manga come to life. Tiny Metal 2 switches up the viewpoints when your units engage in combat too, and this simple dose of variety makes them all the more alluring. We’ll all still eventually skip through them on our way to global domination, but they look great.</p>


<p>Our hands-on demo at TGS framed its combat around the Tokyo Game Show itself, tasking the player with protecting it from the incoming threat posed by the evil enemy general Tsukomo. In reality, I’m not sure how accurate the battle map was to downtown Chiba, but it was still a nice touch.</p>


<p>As with the original game, you’re invited to choose your general to take their army into battle, or should that be generals? In a new wrinkle, you pick a second leader to back you up as an ally and add their units as support to your own, but this also opens the door to playing Tiny Metal 2 in two-player co-op, handing this second commander over to another player. This will give players even more tactical options, looking to combine two generals that have synergetic skills and abilities, and bringing friends together as they forge their way across the battlefield. I wonder whether that extends to local head-to-head play too, but there’s certainly support for massive 8-player online skirmishes.</p>
<p>Our playthrough showcased two of the returning allied generals, with Nathan your standard, balanced everyman option, while his ally, Wolfram, turns things up a notch with her versatile infantry.</p>

<p>It’s hard to get a full grasp of the nuances of tactical warfare in the midst of the cacophony of the Tokyo Game Show floor, but Tiny Metal 2 really does go for an ‘if it ain’t broke’ outlook, delivering grid-based strategy that will be instantly recognisable to fans of Advance Wars and the first Tiny Metal game. This sequel’s major new contribution to the tight tactical action is the addition of sea-based combat to the mix. The ocean-based craft we see here – a cruiser, a lander, and a submarine – are all directly related to their inspiration’s own units, and Tiny Metal 2 isn’t exactly shy about it.</p>
<p>When Intelligent Systems doesn’t seem to be about to bring us a Fire Emblem-esque reimagining of its more down-to-earth army franchise, though, it’s hard to knock Tiny Metal 2 for taking the genre forward.</p>

<p>The turn-based action does exactly what it needs to, giving you the clear visual markers to help you develop your strategy, showing you how far each unit will go, and how far it can fire. There’s also a clear indicator for each unit about its strengths and weaknesses, which should help players get up to speed quicker than ever before; particularly useful for multiplayer, where you might end up playing with people who haven’t played an Advance Wars title or something similar before.</p>
<p>While the visuals and the art design have taken a huge leap forward, one of the key things that felt like it needed tweaking was the strength of the audio. Weak gunshots alongside huge explosions create an audio disparity that I found really distracting, and I hope they can tweak the sound levels just a little before launch.</p>
<p>Tiny Metal 2 takes a bold step across the grid-based genre with reinvigorated visuals nestling up to instantly recognisable tactical combat. I’m really interested to see how much importance is placed on the game’s narrative – particularly with the game engine and visuals adding a heap of character – and, for me, it’s immediately jumped into my list of 2026’s must plays.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When CAPCOM announced that Resident Evil Requiem would also be released on the Nintendo Switch 2, several fans expressed doubts about how the game would run on the console, which is notoriously less powerful than all its current generation counterparts. However, some off-screen footage from last week's Tokyo Game Show 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game running quite smoothly</a> on Nintendo's latest gaming platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Japanese website Famitsu</a> during the Japanese gaming convention, CAPCOM's Game Director Koshi Nakanishi admitted that even the developers were surprised at first to see Resident Evil Requiem running that well on Nintendo Switch 2. Nakanishi credited much of the result to the RE Engine.</p>



<p><em>To begin with, this game is made to be fairly scalable. We've been making it by adjusting various options so that it can be compatible with a wide range of specs, from high to relatively low, so the Switch 2 can be optimized to suit the specs quite smoothly. We haven't tried to force something made for high-end performance to slow down, but have assumed a variety of spec conditions in advance. Even we were surprised when we first saw it, how beautifully it ran. I think it was thanks to the engine team's hard work that it ran so smoothly.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, elsewhere in the Famitsu interview, Game Producer Masato Kumazawa said that the TGS 2025 demo stations offered Nintendo Switch 2 and laptop PCs as options. Indeed, if Resident Evil Requiem runs smoothly on the Nintendo Switch 2, we expect it to do the same on a wide range of computers, though CAPCOM hasn't shared the official PC system requirements yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We do know that the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and path tracing on PC</a>. Presumably, other upscalers will be supported as well, like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Intel XeSS, but they haven't been officially confirmed yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Party Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-party-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-party-review.1312171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that the LEGO brand has been slapped onto almost every kind of family-friendly multiplayer game you can think of at this point, from kart racers to Super Smash Bros clones and even a Rock Band spin-off, it’s surprising that it’s taken this long for the world’s biggest brick maker to construct its own monument to Mario Party. LEGO Party is something more than a block-based knockoff of Nintendo’s long-running virtual boardgame series, though. Sure, it might use Mario Party’s fundamentals as a baseplate to build upon, with a host of wacky minifigs in place of the Mushroom Kingdom’s finest, but every last piece here is absolutely pulsating with personality and there isn’t a single stud-based dud in the 60 minigames on offer. If lots of laughter is what you’re after, LEGO Party has all the right parts for assembling a fun night in with friends and family. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever played one of Nintendo’s party-starters before then the basics of LEGO Party will be as easy to grasp as a tiny coffee mug in a minifig’s fist. In this instance, the goal is to collect gold bricks and studs instead of stars and coins, as you and three other players move around four uniquely themed game boards littered with various stud-sapping hazards and potentially lucrative event spaces to land on. Depending on the board you choose, each session can be as short as six rounds or roughly 45 minutes but can be extended all the way up to three-hour-long, 24-round epics, and each round pits all four players against each other in a minigame designed to be easy to pick up for LEGO Juniors and old-timer Technic fans alike, but tricky to master.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Party Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Everybody can carry up to three power-ups that can be bought with studs at the shop or collected from Wheel of Fortune-style spins, and these can have dramatic leaderboard-levelling impacts, like teleporting your minifig directly to a gold brick space, or slowing your roll so you can increase your chances of moving the exact number of spaces you need. Many of these basics have been established in the Mario Party blueprint several times over, and Lego Party takes an ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fish the dog-eared instruction booklet out of the toy chest and rebuild it’ approach to keeping many of these proven core concepts intact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there are some key elements to be found in LEGO Party’s Pirate, Ninjago, Space, and Theme Park boards that set them apart. For starters, each minigame is chosen democratically by moving your minifig in front of one of three options presented at the beginning of each round, and I liked that it meant my party was given a bit more control over which events we were able to enjoy in each evening’s session. (Of course, if you prefer a more randomised minigame experience like Mario Party, you can opt for that too.) I also prefer LEGO Party’s system of letting the results of each minigame determine the order of turns in each subsequent round, as opposed to Mario Party’s more rigid setup of dictating the order via a dice roll at the start and sticking with that all the way to the end. I find that LEGO Party’s results-driven method increases the ebb and flow of each board and brings extra incentive to do well in each minigame.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each of LEGO Party’s wonderfully candy-coloured and brilliantly detailed boards has a number of special construction zones to land on.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More notably, each of LEGO Party’s wonderfully candy-coloured and brilliantly detailed boards has a number of special construction zones to land on, giving you the choice of two structures to build on that space that can dramatically alter the map and introduce a variety of game-changing additions. For example, in the Theme Park board you might opt to build the Extreme Zone, which introduces a gauntlet run of twitchy stunt challenges to successfully pull off in order to earn a gold brick. Alternatively you could go for the Royal Ramparts, which brings with it a ballista-based minigame for quickly snaring studs, and a catapult for lobbing you at another random player and stealing one of their gold bricks. Mixed in with the various other board-specific features, like when the Space map briefly transforms into a turn-based battle against a giant green alien, and each go-around of these game boards has felt fresh and fun over the dozen or so hours of playtime my family and I have put in together so far.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Everything is Awesome</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also been consistently funny, and that’s largely due to the inclusion of Ted Talker and Paige Turner, LEGO Party’s own quip-cracking commentary team. Seemingly inspired by gag-making game show playcallers like those of Wipeout or Holey Moley, Ted and Paige provide colourful context to each turn taken, as well as responding in real time to each player’s performance in a minigame – either bigging them up when they’re on top, or hilariously dragging them when they’re struggling. Surprisingly, even after multiple playthroughs of each of LEGO Party’s four boards I’ve barely heard the same joke twice, although in fairness that could be because half the time the commentary has been completely drowned out either by fits of uncontrollable laughter or salty bickering as a hard-earned gold brick is ruthlessly snatched away from another player. Seriously, if you’re playing with a competitive group, that tends to sting harder than suddenly finding a lost LEGO brick with the fleshy part of your bare foot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the comedy in LEGO Party stems from the competitive chaos of the challenges themselves, and developer SMG Studio – who previously entertained with the slapstick-based shenanigans of its Moving Out series – has really outdone itself as far as crafting a construction derby of morish minigames. From memory-testing challenges to physics-driven races and rhythm-based dance-offs, Lego Party’s roster of minigames is as diverse as it is diverting, dripping with personality and creative flair. Besides, it’s always a great indication for how immediately engaging multiplayer minigames are when players get caught up in the competition without realising they haven’t even left the pre-game practice screen, which has been a regular occurrence during my time with LEGO Party so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some minigames are terrific, toybox tributes to other titans of multiplayer mayhem, such as the obstacle course dash that feels straight out of Fall Guys or the zero-gravity space shuttle soccer that’s very much in the same orbit as Rocket League. Others lean into the familiarly tactile feel of playing with LEGO itself, like the one that involves trying to build monsters out of a pile of different-shaped blocks without being provided any instructions. There’s one challenge with four soccer goals to defend from an ever-increasing number of balls that plays out like an inverted game of Hungry Hungry Hippos, and another that sits each minifig on a LEGO motorbike and challenges you to navigate an undulating course like a cutesy recreation of Trials HD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the most popular minigames amongst the contestants on my couch are the ones that feel like nothing else we’ve ever played. There’s the frantic, four-way battle to smash your opponents’ LEGO vase with a brick boulder that gradually speeds up as it’s deflected off each player, or the nightclub-themed showdown that sees each of you scramble to fling your minifig onto a floating dance floor with elastic grappling hooks. Of course, everyone in my party has their own personal picks: I love anything on four-wheels, my son’s really into the zero-gravity games, while my daughter’s favourite is… basically whichever minigame she won most recently. But the quality of challenges here is so consistent across the game board, that even when we opt for a random minigame choice we’re rarely disappointed with whatever comes our way.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Everything is Cool When You’re Part of a Team</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I also appreciate that success in these minigames is mostly reliant on a combination of skill and luck. You won’t find any cheap button-mashing challenge types here like the ones that often pop up in Mario Party, which I always felt put unnecessary wear and tear on my expensive game controllers, not to mention seeming somewhat unfair to the younger players in my lounge room who haven’t had decades of button-pressing practice pumped into their biceps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There also aren’t any lopsided three-vs-one match types to force the majority to unfairly gang up on an individual, as LEGO Party’s minigames are always evenly split – either every man for himself, or face-offs in teams of two on the occasions you land on a Brick Battle square. These team-based clashes range from the pure intensity of a doubles game of air hockey through to more ridiculous co-op tasks where one person aims a T-shirt cannon and the other fires it at an audience of shirtless minifigs, and all of them demand effective communication and coordination between duos in order to get the win. In fact, I enjoyed these Brick Battles so much that I was slightly disappointed to find there were only nine of them included in the roster.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, I am happy that LEGO Party doesn’t bother with random participation awards at the end of each board, like many Mario Party games do. There’s still plenty of twists and turns as fortune-changing chance spaces are sprinkled across the map in the closing stages, and many games I’ve played have seen the lead constantly change hands all the way through to the final round, but the winner is always clearly defined by the time you reach the end – not unfairly elevated into first position after the fact purely because of some arbitrary, unseen statistic like they happened to land on the most event spaces. It makes victory feel like it was achieved through genuine merit rather than more mystifying means. That doesn’t mean that other players won’t take any opportunity to knock you off the winner’s podium, though – and I mean that quite literally, especially during the riotously interactive results screen that typically devolves into delirious slap fights, slipping on banana peels, and background breakdancing.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some minigames are terrific, toybox tributes to other titans of multiplayer mayhem.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While LEGO Party’s lineup of playable minifigs might not feature anyone as iconic as Mario or Yoshi, it makes up for it in terms of sheer numbers and the substantial suite of options for character customisation. Playing through each of the game boards or one of the curated minigame playlists earns XP that gradually unlocks new minifigs along a series of simple progression paths, as well as awarding you carrots that can be spent unlocking a separate collection of minifigs in the shop. There are more minifigs here than you could shake a mini twig at – by my count well over 200, from goth kid minifigs to person-shaped pizza slices and stylish ninja warriors – and as you unlock each one their individual parts can be used to craft entirely new creations of your own. Want a minifig with tigerprint pants, a Miami Vice-style linen jacket, and an American football helmet? Weird combination but sure, it’s all yours. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite LEGO Games</h3><p>I'm brick games, b!tch!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bolting things together, I’d love to see LEGO Party leverage the many pop culture partnerships that the Danish brickmaker has amassed over the years and bring them to the party either in the form of expansion packs or future sequels. A LEGO Star Wars board with minigames designed around lightsaber battles and Death Star trench runs would be a treat, as would a LEGO Indiana Jones board that had event spaces to trigger Raiders of the Lost-ark style booby traps and boulders. Given Nintendo’s cosying up with the LEGO brand in recent times, it’s not inconceivable that we could even see a LEGO Mario LEGO Party expansion, at least in the Switch versions, to really bring things full circle. To be clear, nothing of this nature has been announced and I’m merely thinking out loud, but I’ve had a blast with LEGO Party so far, and I really hope that it’s set the fantastic plastic foundations for a series that’s here to stay.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">LEGO Party doesn’t completely reinvent the tried-and-true Mario Party formula, but it does introduce some welcome tweaks to its structure, a uniformly high quality collection of minigames hard-tuned for hilarity, and an enjoyably silly game show-style presentation that’s yet to overstay its welcome. The four game boards on offer might be a few less than Super Mario Party Jamboree’s collection, but the transformative nature of their layouts brings welcome variety and surprise to each session, and the considerable minifig customisation options are a joy to tinker with. Creative, colourful, and a consistent crack up, LEGO Party is purpose-built to turn any boring old night into a block party filled with belly laughs.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-party-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo recently kicked off Mario's 40th anniversary, and it appears other companies are joining in on the celebrations.</p>
<p>One of them happens to be First 4 Figures, with the "high end" collectible maker announcing its Mario and Yoshi statue (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/03/pre-orders_for_mario_and_yoshi_statue_go_live_on_first_4_figures_website">which we previously covered here on Nintendo Life</a>) is now back in production - with standard, exclusive and definitive editions available to pre-order.</p>
<p>The definitive edition also comes with the bonus Bowser Checkpoint Flag and is priced at $749.99 / £558.03. The standard edition starts at $549.99 / £409.22, and the exclusive edition will set you back $599.99 / £446.42. There's also an early bird special if you place an order before 13th October 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Calling all Super Mario fans! We're thrilled to announce that we will be heading back into production to complete the edition size of our Mario and Yoshi statue, featuring the Standard, Exclusive, and Definitive versions!"</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250930.html">official press release</a>, Nintendo Singapore was established last week on 26th September 2025. It aims to accelerate the growth of the company's business in Southeast Asia and will be led by managing director Takahiro Miura. Here's the announcement and overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Co., Ltd.

<p>The same announcement also mentions how Nintendo is considering establishing a local entity in the Kingdom of Thailand to accelerate business in this location. Earlier this year, Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">set up a new subsidiary</a> located in Taiwan, including the launch of the Nintendo eShop in this location.</p>
<p>This follows the launch of the Switch 2 in June, with sales of the new system already off to a flying start. In less than a week, the unit sold over 3.5 million units worldwide, and as of the end of the first month, the device had already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">sold more than 6 million units</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the focus is on "stability improvements" to make the new and old hybrid hardware super stable. Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>

<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1972886876018123087">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has shared some insight about this latest update on social media. While the patch notes list the sole change as "stability", there is apparently "some code related to handling accounts and system time" that's been updated (<a href="https://switchbrew.org/wiki/20.5.0">via SwitchBrew</a>). As for Switch 2, there are no additional details about these patch notes right now, but according to the same source, there could still be some compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles.</p>
<p>If we find out anything else about this latest update (or if there are any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/more-switch-games-have-received-switch-2-compatibility-fixes">compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles</a>, similar to the previous update), we'll let you know. This follows an update at the start of this month, which also included stability improvements. Nintendo released multiple stability fixes in July and earlier in June as well.</p>
<p>To manually perform this latest system update, navigate to System Settings &gt; System Update &gt; and from there you should be able to download and update your system. Nintendo also updated its music app today, adding a new track from Princess Peach's Switch outing.</p>

<p>Joining Dr. Eggman early next year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> is getting Sega Villains Stage DLC next year, which will see Joe Musashi face off against classic bad guys from past releases.</p>
<p>In August, we found out Sonic's Dr. Eggman would be first up, and now Sega and Lizardcube have lifted the lid on the second character. It's Death Adder - the fearsome giant from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/golden_axe">Golden Axe</a> series. Here's a teaser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The katana verses the axe. Joe Musashi will face off against another classic SEGA Villain – Death Adder, the fearsome giant from the Golden Axe series. Play against him, Dr Eggman and another mysterious villain in the SEGA Villains Stage DLC for SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned, these two villains will be joined by one other mysterious guest villain. And they're scheduled to land in early 2026. This reveal follows last week's game update. This particular patch improved the Nintendo Switch resolution and also addressed some bugs.</p>

Cheating has been an ongoing issue with the franchise, up to and including last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-dutys-anti-cheat-aims-to-take-out-cheaters-in-black-ops-6/1100-6527263/" data-ref-id="1100-6527263">Black Ops 6</a>. To combat this trend, Activision has unveiled the latest upgrades to its anti-cheat measures ahead of the Black Ops 7 open beta.</p><p>According to Activision, in-game detection measures have been enhanced by training "advanced machine learning systems on millions of hours of gameplay." The publisher is also stepping up its legal measures to dismantle attempts to monetize cheats outside of the game.</p><p>The primary tools being used to combat cheaters are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-how-to-turn-on-secure-boot-on-pc/1100-6533761/" data-ref-id="1100-6533761">Secure Boot</a> and TPM 2.0 requirements for Black Ops 7 on PC. Those measures will be implemented alongside the newest incarnation of the Ricochet anti-cheat software to prevent cheaters from sidestepping or fooling them. Activision notes that it will also be removing cheaters in real time as they are detected.</p><p>Even these upgrades may not fully eliminate cheating from the Call of Duty franchise, but part of the goal behind this beta is to test these measures under live conditions. Everything learned during this trial period can be used to make these systems even more effective when Black Ops 7 launches.</p><p>Activision will conclude the open beta on Wednesday, October 8, at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Black Ops 7 will officially launch on November 14 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Since the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> back in 2022, I've seen one question circulating online with far more fervor and frequency than any other: Does it have any connection to the rest of the series? After years of waiting and speculation, we finally have an answer.</p><p><em>Warning: Silent Hill f spoilers to follow.</em></p><p>If you've rolled credits on Silent Hill f, you're familiar with its shocking first ending. In it, it is revealed that the Hinako exploring Ebisugaoka is actually a twenty-something-year-old Hinako experiencing deep, drug-induced psychosis. Though players have witnessed what seemingly started out as an ordinary day for our high school-age main character, we come to discover that, in the real world, it's Hinako's wedding day, and she's spent the last few hours of it murdering her friends and family members. Her actions are, of course, horrific, but make sense if you do a little digging around.</p><p>Turns out, Hinako has been taking Kakura-Makakura, a natural medicine made from ground Hakkokusou seeds that are then placed in small, red capsules. Originally given to her by her friend Shu to help with recurring tension headaches, it becomes obvious that the apprentice apothecary gave her the medication without properly assessing the risk in taking it or properly considering its reputation. A stack of journal entries on Shu's desk gives us minimal insight into the medicine, as he writes he prescribed it to her to "curb her reliance" on traditional medication and made it by combining peony and kudzu root. Fortunately, documents scattered throughout the town and spirit realm give us the opportunity to learn a bit more about the medication ourselves.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577412-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_35_59_49.still006.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577412-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_35_59_49.still006.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577412"></a><figcaption>Hinako looks at a pond surrounded by white flowers in Silent Hill f.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577412-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_35_59_49.still006.png"></figure><p>According to research papers found in Silent Hill f, Hakkokusou is also referred to as "the flower of the gods." The documents go on to state that the herb is an important part of folklore, as it is known for giving those who consume its seeds the ability to converse with gods, visit their lands, and awaken dormant powers--all of which happen to Hinako. Lastly, the papers describe Hakkokusou as "notoriously difficult to cultivate as it requires a very specific environment in which to grow" and is "rarely found in the wild." It makes sense then, that the one place we find Hakkokusou in Silent Hill f is near Shu's home, which also serves as the town's apothecary.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577413-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_24_28.still001.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577414-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_30_32.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577415-persciption_for_my_partner_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577416-persciption_for_my_partner_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577417-persciption_for_my_partner_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577413,1300-4577414,1300-4577415,1300-4577416,1300-4577417" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577413-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_24_28.still001.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577414-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_30_32.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577415-persciption_for_my_partner_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577416-persciption_for_my_partner_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577417-persciption_for_my_partner_3.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577413-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_24_28.still001.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577414-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_30_32.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577415-persciption_for_my_partner_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577416-persciption_for_my_partner_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577417-persciption_for_my_partner_3.png"></figure><p>Upon reaching Shu's house, you'll stumble upon a small pond surrounded by large, white flowers unlike any you've seen around town--and this is precisely where Silent Hill f shows us how it connects to the other Silent Hill games. Though referred to as Hakkokusou in Silent Hill f, Silent Hill fans will recognize these flowers as While Claudia, a "perennial herb found near water" that features white blossoms and contains hallucinogenic seeds.</p><p>Since the series' beginning, White Claudia has played a notable role in Silent Hill. In the first game, protagonist Harry Mason stumbles upon several documents indicating the game's cultists have been consuming the flower's seed during their ceremonies, somewhat explaining their bizarre behavior. While visiting the town's hospital, he also finds a broken bottle of Aglaophotis--a thick, red liquid later revealed to be refined White Claudia.</p><p>In Silent Hill 3, Harry's daughter, Heather Mason, calls a pendant her father gave her one of her "most treasured belongings." If you check it's item description, it reads, "There's a jewel inside, like a little red tablet." Later in the game, we find out that this jewel is actually a small vial of Aglaophotis as well. Most recently, White Claudia made an appearance in Silent Hill 2's remake, in which developer Bloober Team added a new ending that sees James take the substance and begin to hallucinate his wife Mary back before she developed her terminal illness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577418-ff%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577418" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577418-ff%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577418"></a><figcaption>Heather's necklace.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577418-ff%283%29.png"></figure><p>And to make this theory even more convincing, it's worth delving a bit more into White Claudia's liquid form, Aglaophotis. According to <a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Aglaophotis#Silent_Hill:_Downpour" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fandom's Silent Hill page</a> for the in-game drug, "Aglaophotis may have been a factual herb, sometimes connected in identity to the European peony. The Greek doctor Dioscorides named Aglaophotisas a member of the peony family, Paeoniaceae." This directly coincides with Shu's journal entries, which describe him as using peonies to produce Kakura-Makakura. Lastly, Agura no Hotei-sama--one of the item's required to attain Silent Hill f's Fox Wedding ending--is described as a medicine bottle containing a red liquid, similar to Aglaophotis. Later on, Hinako is forced to drink the refined "flower of the gods" to help steady herself in the spirit world.</p><p>So although Silent Hill f might not take place in Silent Hill, it feels safe to say that it definitely takes place in the same world and tugs at the same threads and themes as its predecessors. It's also worth mentioning that it's among the best games in the series, with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/v/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">Silent Hill f review</a> calling it, "a visual spectacle, a mastercraft in psychological horror, a work of narrative brilliance, and a new benchmark for the Silent Hill series."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Electronic Arts just announced that it is going to be acquired and taken private <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">in a massive $55 billion deal</a> led by an investor group composed of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The deal, expected to close in Q1 of EA’s 2027 fiscal year (which takes place from April 1st to June 30th, 2026), isn’t just a huge amount of money involving one of gaming’s largest publishers; it could have massive ramifications for the company, the types of games it invests in, and the people that make them.</p><p>The deal itself, a leveraged buyout, consists of about $36 billion in cash from Silver Lake, Affinity Partners, and PIF (which is rolling over its 9.9 percent equity stake it already has in EA), while JPMorgan Chase Bank will provide $20 billion of debt financing (“$18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250929186526/en/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-%2455-Billion">according to EA’s press release</a>). That means that the newly private company will have to do a lot to justify the massive price tag.</p><p>“Leveraged buyouts leverage debt, which usually means more layoffs, smaller budgets for growth, and fewer risks,” Mona Ibrahim, former lead counsel at Epic Games, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7378446006037663744-MsG9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAIV1iYBHi7OPybalzIKilWBO4bTY5vJb8c">said on LinkedIn</a>. “For an industry that thrives on invention, this seems problematic.”</p><p>There isn’t a direct comparison to this situation. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lzyd46jolc2o">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella notes</a>, “$20 billion of debt financing is a shockingly large number to have to service, while also transitioning from a public to private organization and all the implications that has on the people that work in it. We’ve obviously never seen anything like this at this scale in the industry before.” But we can look at what has happened to some of Microsoft’s big gaming acquisitions as a bit of a roadmap for what may happen with EA.</p><p>A few months after the completion of the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard deal in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">October 2023</a>, Microsoft laid off 1,900 staffers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">across Activision Blizzard and Xbox</a>, and Blizzard’s president left the company. An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050297/blizzard-survival-game-cancelled-layoffs">in-development survival game</a> was canceled — a notable decision given Blizzard’s past history of creating enduring, long-running franchises like <em>Diablo</em> and <em>Warcraft</em>. Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">shut down</a> Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, which it picked up as part of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">ZeniMax Media acquisition</a>, and as part of a big company-wide layoff earlier this year, it cut staff at ZeniMax and <em>Candy Crush</em> maker King (which is under the umbrella of Activision Blizzard).</p><p>It also seems like that EA will continue to focus primarily on its most lucrative tentpole franchises, a direction the publisher has been headed toward for some time. You just need to look at its <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf">most recent earnings slides</a> to see it. EA’s “core business” slide features six games with “massive online communities”: <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>EA Sports College Football</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>The Sims</em>. The slide also has a small mention of EA’s free-to-play <em>Skate</em> revival, which just launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date">in early access</a> and is another attempt from EA to make a big multiplayer game.</p><p>Basically, EA’s major roadmap features a lot of sports, big shooters in <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and additions to <em>The Sims 4</em> (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247213/the-next-sims-is-going-into-playtesting-soon">a new <em>Sims</em> in development</a>). There are also a few smaller games tossed in here and there (like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648543/star-wars-zero-company-celebration">some <em>Star Wars</em> games</a> and a <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> remaster) and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/library/freetoplay">a bunch of free-to-play games</a>. For the most part, the scale of these titles continues to increase. <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is being developed by <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-studios">four of EA’s most notable studios</a> in order to compete with <em>Call of Duty</em>, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247213/the-next-sims-is-going-into-playtesting-soon">the next <em>Sims</em></a> will be an ambitious shift for the franchise. In short: EA is putting more money into fewer games. And the buyout is likely to speed up this process even more.</p><p>This puts EA’s smaller games and underperforming franchises in a difficult position. After BioWare’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> did poorly enough that EA had to say so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349886/dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-eas-expectations">in a pre-earnings press release</a> earlier this year, it wasn’t long before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604549/bioware-layoffs-shifts-mass-effect">the beloved studio was hit with layoffs</a>. The EA Originals label has had some hits with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Split Fiction</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352157/it-takes-two-interview-developer-josef-fares-hazelight-studio-co-op">It Takes Two</a></em>, but other games, like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23690449/ea-immortals-of-aveum-pc-system-requirements-next-gen">Immortals of Aveum</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a></em>, weren’t nearly as successful, so the new EA might opt not to work on more Originals projects in the future. EA has already shown itself to be ruthless even with games that seemingly have a lot of potential: it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">canceled its <em>Black Panther</em> game earlier this year</a> and shuttered the studio behind it, despite it being attached to a film franchise that earned more than $2 billion.</p><p>Once the deal closes, there could be other cost-cutting measures, including increased use of AI. “The investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in the coming years,” according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">the <em>Financial Times</em></a>, citing “people involved in the transaction.” EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who will continue to lead the company after the deal closes, has said that AI is at the “<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ea-the-future-of-entertainment-is-interactive-as-dev-looks-to-become-launchpad-for-new-businesses/">very core</a>” of EA’s business. Given the history of some past big leveraged buyouts, EA may still have a turbulent future ahead, even if it makes big changes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil has been one of the video game industry's quintessential, flagship horror games for years now, delivering everything over the years from unsettling, atmospheric haunting to outright jumpscares. But as its development team continues to search for new ways to freak people out, a few of its leaders are admitting that they're not always 100% certain what elements of Resident Evil are actually scary anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from our interview with director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazama at Tokyo Game Show 2025. We started by talking about Resident Evil: Requiem's new protagonist, Grace, and her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">differences from the more action-oriented Leon S. Kennedy</a>. That led to a discussion of why the series was pulling back on the heavy action elements in Requiem, as Nakanishi explains:</p><blockquote>I think you can broadly classify Resident Evil titles on a scale of how much they're like Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 7 was definitely on the 2 side of that, as it returned to survival horror roots and was very acclaimed for that. Resident Evil Village built on that and added in more action and gunplay and brought it toard the RE4 side of that particular scale. But if we kept going in that direction there's almost an inflation effect, where you have to keep adding more and more action to outdo the previous title, and by doing that you ultimately end up where Resident Evil 5 and 6 went, and although they're still great games, the general consensus is that they pushed Resident Evil so far in the action direction that it was no longer horror. I didn't want to have to do that with Resident Evil's ninth title where I just tried to outdo the action in Village and ended up making something I didn't want to make. Firmly swinging the scale toward the Resident Evil 2 style was our intention, and it's almost an upgrade of that Resident 2 style.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But that led to a follow-up question where I asked Nakanishi about the other side of the coin, of trying to outdo their own scares with each new title. Nakanishi noted that their goal isn't necessarily to innovate horror, but there is a certain numbing effect that working on these games for so long has, where they really need to see audience reactions to know if what they've made is actually scary or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it," Nakanishi says. "There was actually a bit of a worry internally before we showed the [Resident Evil: Requiem] hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary? Because we don't even know anymore. This is our bread and better, what we make every day."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ended up asking Nakanishi if there was anything they had cut from the game for being too scary. He couldn't recall anything specific that was actually removed from the game after it had been added, but he did remember one anecdote that might make fans of Ethan Winters chuckle:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We didn't really implement it, so it wasn't cut, but- we don't know if something's scary. So we say, we'll do this, we'll do that, we keep adding on stuff, and at one point we were like, what if [Grace] gets a big gash in her leg, or her leg gets cut off, because that thing attacks her, and oh my god it's so scary, but we talked ourselves down a little bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So at least we know Grace probably isn't going to have the same issues Ethan did with hands. Probably.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/how-private-ownership-will-change-electronic-arts/</link>

<p>However, Futter thinks the move from public to private ownership will shift the source of the ever-present demands for consistently rising profits. "All public AAA companies have overemphasized 'returning value to shareholders' over taking care of all stakeholder groups, including labor," he said. "Now, that will be shifted to keeping the company afloat amidst enormous debt payments and servicing [private equity] owners."</p>
<h2>Saud-EA Arabia</h2>
<p>The big wild card that makes this buyout different from others, analysts agreed, was the involvement of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. For the Saudis—who already own almost 10 percent of EA and minority stakes in many other gaming companies—this purchase is "very much about aligning gaming and esports alongside entertainment and sports as key diversification pillars for the Saudi economy," Niko Partners' Daniel Ahmad told Ars.</p>
<p>Niko's research shows that EA's sports portfolio could be particularly attractive to the Saudis; 33 percent of PC players and 44 percent of console players in the Middle East say the sports game genre is their favorite. Those sports games also fit well with Saudi Arabia's existing investments in the esports sector, Cole pointed out.</p>

<p>But Cole also warned that the Saudi involvement in a major US-based game publisher could draw government attention, especially when it comes to data privacy. "Games can open a Pandora's Box of consumer info and data collection, and I expect heavy US government scrutiny of the deal, both initially and ongoing," Cole said.</p>
<p>The Saudi regime's stringent position on some social issues might also have an effect on the content of some EA games in the future, analysts warned. Futter said that the removal of LGBTQIA-friendly material in the socially liberal Sims franchise would be the "canary in the coal mine" for that kind of content-based meddling.</p>
<p>Van Dreunen said that Saudi Arabia's investment "has to do with soft power" more than any specific games or content. That could mean relocating some of EA's operations or events to Riyadh, and "a stronger emphasis on global cultural reach" for EA titles. With Saudi money underwriting the risk, "the pressure to deliver quarterly profits will ease, even as the pressure to deliver cultural relevance increases," he said.</p>
<p>Whether that will lead the Saudis or EA's other new private owners to directly meddle in EA's day-to-day operations, though, remains a question. "The best case scenario is that the private equity firms leave the company alone and let leadership move forward as the experts," Futter said. "Leveraged buyouts are wildly risky (see: Toys R Us), and the only winners in situations like that are the PE firms."</p>

			<p>Techland's latest mainline installment in its Dying Light series, Dying Light: The Beast, is finally here, and players can leap into the infected-ridden resort town and forest area of Castor Woods with returning protagonist Kyle Crane back at the helm.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">reviewed</a> Dying Light: The Beast for Wccftech, and it was my first time diving into the series, which means that everything that was old hat for series veterans was brand new to me.</p>



<p>It also means there were a few things I would've appreciated knowing about Dying Light: The Beast before jumping in, which is why this guide will aim to give you five things to know about diving into Techland's latest zombie-riddled adventure.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-starter-guide-5-things-to-know-about-leaping-into-castor-woods">Dying Light: The Beast Starter Guide - 5 Things to Know About Leaping Into Castor Woods</h2>



<h3 id="h-don-t-go-out-at-night-at-least-not-right-away">Don't go out at night - at least not right away</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>A key part of the Dying Light series is its day-and-night cycle, and the terrors that you can face when the sun goes down, compared to when it's high in the sky. Going out at night is a core part of the Dying Light experience, and the tense moments you experience while being chased by one or multiple Volatile's on your way to a safe zone are where some of the best gameplay moments come from.</p>



<p>But they can also be the source of the most frustrating, if you're not prepared. That's why once you've reached the Town Hall and you're let loose in Old Town in Castor Woods, do yourself a favour and spend some time avoiding the night. Take advantage of not having to deal with Volatile's during the day and unlock the safe zones in Old Town before you start exploring the area at night.</p>



<p>Getting killed by Volatile's and losing a bunch of XP early on while you're trying to level up and gain some key skills, like being able to jump kick zombies isn't how you want to spend your early hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-craft-your-bow-and-keep-it-upgraded">Craft your bow and keep it upgraded</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first ranged weapon you'll get in the game is the Hunting Bow, and getting it crafted and in your inventory is something you'll want to do as soon as possible. It'll be on the first workbench you find in the game, which is Techland basically signposting it to you as something to get in your inventory right away, but you probably won't have the materials for it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's an easy fix, as the required materials aren't too difficult to scavenge. Once you have it in your inventory, it's also worth keeping it upgraded as much as possible. Particularly when you're taking on human enemies throughout the game, your bow is key to ensuring stealth-focused scenarios go well.</p>



<h3 id="h-upgrade-your-bandage-flashlight-and-throwing-knife-blueprints">Upgrade your bandage, flashlight, and throwing knife blueprints</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll be upgrading your gear and swapping out weapons over the course of Dying Light: The Beast, but the upgrades you'll want to really prioritize are your blueprint upgrades. Specifically the blueprints for your bandages, UV flashlight, and throwing knives.</p>



<p>Upgrading the blueprints for each item makes them more effective, and in the case of throwing knives, lets you craft more of them without using as many resources.</p>



<p>These three items are the ones you will likely use more than any other during your time in Castor Woods, and upgrading their blueprints as quickly as you can will have you set up for the endgame well before you get there.</p>



<h3 id="h-mash-that-survivor-sense-at-all-times">Mash that Survivor Sense at all times</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Areas like this can look devoid of resources, until your Survivor Sense reveals otherwise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Survivor Sense ability can be occasionally helpful for keeping track of enemies nearby, human and zombie alike, but what it's really key for is telling you where resources are near you. You'll want to keep mashing the survivor sense as much as you can, because you're otherwise liable to miss scores of resources that you'll need for upgrading your gear and for crafting the resources you need while out in the wilds of Castor Woods.</p>



<h3 id="h-you-don-t-need-to-fight-everyone-and-everything">You don't need to fight everyone and everything</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>Particularly, if you're like me, you might feel like you need to wipe every zombie you see off the board when you see them. Absolutely not the case - it's good to keep your aggression meter up so that you can launch into Beast mode quickly when you do get into a big fight, so picking off a few zombies here and there isn't a bad idea.</p>



<p>But you absolutely don't need to fight every zombie you come across, and you're better off not trying to. Besides the fact that your weapons will deteriorate faster, you'll more than likely find yourself getting overwhelmed with all the noise you're making, and then you're back in the position of losing XP for no good reason.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you're a Dying Light veteran, than most of this was probably old hat for you, but if you were like me and are playing The Beast without having checked out the previous games, than these tips will help you start off your journey through Castor Woods on the right foot.</p>

I was tired. Satisfied, sure, but also tired and ready to be done with the game. <em>Silksong</em> has given me a similar exit path, but I don't think I'm ready to part ways just yet. I know there's a secret third act/ending that people say is worth chasing down, which I'll probably do. But it was also so god damn relieving to watch those credits roll.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why does Saudi Arabia want to make games? What will the largest leveraged buyout in history mean for EA and its employees? How will the consequences of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">new $55 billion deal</a> ripple out across the rest of the video game industry? I reached out to some analysts to get their take on the sale and what it tells us about the state of gaming now, and where it’s headed. Here’s what they said.</p> <h2>A “soft-power” play</h2> <p>“This is the second-largest deal in games history—$50 billion for a mature publisher whose growth engine has stalled,” Joost van Dreunen, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><u>SuperJoost Playlist</u></a>, wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “It shows how sovereign capital, not just Big Tech, is now dictating who controls cultural IP. It also highlights how public-market fatigue with slow-growth publishers is pushing them toward privatization.”</p> <p>Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has mandated $38 billion be invested in turning the country into a gaming powerhouse, with sizable chunks of that already being spent on buying up <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-scopely-niantic-saudi-arabia-monster-hunter-1851769360">mobile game makers</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">taking over esports</a>, and acquiring equity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/snk-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman-mbs-king-of-fighte-1848754233">major gaming companies</a> (it already owns 10 percent of EA going into the sale). While other private equity partners are part of the sale, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/saudi-plans-for-video-game-hub-grow-with-55-billion-ea-deal?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that the majority of the funding comes from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.</p>

 <p>In the <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/electronic-arts-55b-buyout-doesnt">latest edition of his newsletter,</a> van Dreunen points to the illogic of the the deal’s financial math, which values EA much more highly than its current cash flow would suggest it should be for a leveraged buyout in which $20 billion is financed through debt. He argues the deal underpins Saudi Arabia’s willingness to overpay for U.S. cultural IP, as well as Wall Street’s loss of interest in legacy gaming businesses whose growth potential has stalled out in recent years. “At the center sits the irrational financial logic that tells you it’s about power, prestige, and staking Saudi Arabia’s claim in American entertainment,” he writes.</p>

 <h2>Gaming continues to consolidate in search of growth</h2> <p>The conventional wisdom was that amid the post-pandemic flurry of market consolidation, EA would merge with someone sooner or later. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-acquisition-apex-legends-star-wars-fifa-nbcuniversal-1848957274">It reportedly engaged in acquisition talks</a> with Apple and others back in 2022, with a potential deal to to merge with NBCUniversal eventually falling apart over price. Pundits have called on Disney to buy the publisher of <em>Madden</em> and <em>FIFA</em> (now <em>EA Sports FC</em>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190223172654/https://kotaku.com/wall-street-journal-to-disney-buy-ea-5075163">for decades</a>. “We couldn’t be in a stronger position as a standalone company,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said back in 2022.</p>

 <p>What’s changed since then? EA hasn’t has a new runaway success story since <em>Apex Legends</em>, which shadow-dropped back in 2019 and stumbled last year amid declining interest.<em> EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and now <em>College Football</em> are the core games sustaining the publisher, but it’s unclear where they go from here. <em>Battlefield </em>is taking on <em>Call of Duty</em> again for the first time in years, but it’s an expensive live-service gambit at a time when few new multiplayer games seem to be able to stick for any length of time.</p>

 <p>“EA’s mobile games business has traditionally underperformed and should be a much larger part of its overall business,” Piers Harding-Roll, Games Research Director at Ampere Analysis, told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “This alignment could help transform EA’s mobile business. EA’s revenue growth in recent years has been benign, so the opportunity to drive growth and build out a long-term strategy by bringing together a cross-section of expertise is attractive to both parties.”</p>

 <p>The publishers attempts to adapt its hit franchises into mobile games have either been canceled (<a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-mobile-shutdown-ea-respawn-battlefield-1850056170"><em>Battlefield</em></a>), quickly closed down (<a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-mobile-shutdown-ea-respawn-battlefield-1850056170"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>), or struggled to bring in boatloads of money (<a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/ea-sports-mobile-revenue-1-billion"><em>Madden</em></a>). “The deal creates opportunities for Saudi Arabia to strengthen its console &amp; PC presence, and provides EA with an opportunity for synergy with [Saudi-owned mobile developer] Scopely for ongoing mobile expansion, now that both are under the PIF,” Daniel Ahmad, Director of Research and Insights at Niko Partners, told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email.</p> <h2>Leveraged buyouts are a recipe for pain</h2> <p>Big private-equity deals involving lots of debt often <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/6/21024740/private-equity-taylor-swift-toys-r-us-elizabeth-warren">bring with them sharp cuts</a>. Business analysts will call this “right-sizing” or “rationalizing the business,” but what it means is people paid a fraction of their CEO’s salary get fired. EA currently has roughly 15,000 employees, a number many industry watchers expect to decline. “Leveraged buyouts deposit a large amount of long-term debt on the company being acquired and an additional $20 billion of debt will need to be serviced through cutting costs and building more margin from existing businesses to generate more free cash flow,” Harding-Roll said.</p> <p>There’s been a lot of debate on whether going private will free the company up to invest in franchises long-term rather than invest almost exclusively in games that deliver predictable quarterly returns. Could a lack of shareholder pressure yield more single-player blockbusters, or provide EA with enough runway to give the next <em>Mass Effect</em> as much time in development as it needs? Or will the debt crunch incentivize EA to lop off anything that’s not generating revenue and retreat even further into annualized sequels?</p>

 <p>“EA’s empire is heavy on sports and sprawling studios, so some ‘right-sizing’ is inevitable—expect a sharper split between the sports division and everything else, some studio consolidation, and likely relocation of certain functions to Saudi Arabia,” van Dreunen told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “Being private could also tilt its content strategy back toward longer-cycle franchises rather than quarter-to-quarter live-ops churn. <em>Battlefield</em> gets a cushion, but there will be trims and a sports-versus-everything-else carve-out.”</p> <h2>Unconventional players in uncharted waters</h2> <p>Video games are a notoriously chaotic business, mergers are inherently unpredictable, and a sovereign wealth fund has never owned one of the biggest gaming publishers in the world before (following Activision’s sale to Microsoft, EA is the biggest non-platform, non-Chinese company in gaming by revenue). While it’s reasonable to explain the deal by pointing to Saudi Arabia’s global PR blitz and synergies in sports and mobile gaming, it’s also reasonable to think it’s way too early to tell how this will shake out, especially when you throw a $20 billion loan into the mix.</p>

 <p>“I can’t say I know what it all means yet, or what this deal will result in when it comes to EA’s games and studios,” Mat Piscatella, Circana’s Director of Gaming Research, told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “I’d hazard to even attempt to speculate at this point. Of course, leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn’t been great for the acquired companies, but I do not know if that will be the case here given the parties involved.”</p> <p>“It’s very much about aligning gaming and esports alongside entertainment and sports as key diversification pillars for the Saudi economy,” Ahmad added. “The deal also begs the question of what will come in the future regarding mergers and acquisitions for the global games industry, given the ongoing consolidation trend, and the ability for smaller companies to break through to walk among the giants.”</p> <p>While more layoffs may be a grim inevitability, the analysts <em>Kotaku</em> spoke with didn’t predict any seismic shifts in the immediate aftermath of the deal, set to close next summer. “I don’t expect any significant changes to the upcoming slate of games over the next couple of years,” Harding-Roll said. “The biggest opportunities remain growth of the <em>Battlefield</em> franchise, growth of the <em>EA Sports FC</em> franchise during the World Cup 2026 and bigger exposure to mobile gaming.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Monomi Park has returned to its slime-tastic origins, more than nine years after the Early Access launch of <em>Slime Rancher</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">with its much-anticipated follow-up, <em>Slime Rancher 2</em></a>. The game's developer first released <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-sales-hit-100k-in-under-6-hours" rel="nofollow">through Early Access in 2022</a>, and after three years, it bid farewell as it finally slime dunked its way onto consoles and PCs.</p>

<p><em>Slime Rancher 2</em> sets out to continue the epic adventures of rancher and protagonist, Beatrix "Bea" LeBeau, but this time around, in a brand new location, the Rainbow Island. This new location is filled to the brim with new slimes to care for, mysteries to uncover, and areas to explore as <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> aims to deliver a bigger, slime-filled adventure, something the developer has long sought to provide since the original game's release.</p>

<h2>A Brave New Slime-tastic World</h2>

<p>This much-anticipated sequel to the 2016 farming sim game from indie studio Monomi Park continues the story as our protagonist, Beatrix "Bea" LeBeau, heads off to Rainbow Island for a brand new adventure and more slimes to wrangle! While the journey that brought her to this new location is somewhat cloaked in mystery, equally intriguing are the secrets that Bea will uncover during her stay on Rainbow Island.</p>

Now, ready in its final jiggly form, players can finally pick up the story of Bea as she sets off to unknown territory with a new adventure awaiting her on Rainbow Island!</p>

<p>Much of what many loved about <em>Slime Rancher</em> is present in its sequel, like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/slime-rancher-2-preview" rel="nofollow">gameplay loop of wrangling new squishing slimes</a>, farming Plorts, exchanging them for currency, and upgrading Bea's tech to explore the island further. By the way, there are a few new slimes, features, and plenty more for new and returning players to wrangle with when jumping into <em>Slime Rancher 2</em>.</p>

<h2>It's Plortin' Time!</h2>

<p>Let's be honest: one has never played <em>Slime Rancher</em>, and to one's shock and horror, it's really a good thing we got to experience this game through its sequel. In this open-world simulation sequel, Bea boards a mysterious boat that crosses the Slime Sea, escorting her to Rainbow Island, where not only will she encounter new and returning slimes and unique resources to collect, but also discover ancient technology that she can learn and use to navigate her new surroundings.</p>

<p>From the get-go, players are given the option to turn on or off a few gameplay settings to make their time and experiences on Rainbow Island smoother. The biggest gameplay option is regarding the Tarr and Feral Slimes spawning on the island, as these slimes are incredibly hostile and can be a nuisance to deal with when exploring, so for a more cozy gameplay experience, turning them off would be wise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-561.jpg?itok=hP0G99oI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-561.jpg?itok=_jCwiVJd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>I wonder what's behind this Cotton Gordo?&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each new area on the Rainbow Island is mostly easy to access, with exceptions for the Powderfall Bluffs and the Grey Labyrinth, which have specific requirements needed to unlock. It's possible for players to unlock them quite easily; however, unlocking the Grey Labyrinth will require players to acquire a particular gadget from a friend and solve some puzzles before this area opens its doors to Bea.</p>

<p>Upon arriving on Rainbow Island, Bea will gain a new home, the Conservatory, the sequel's counterpart to the Ranch from the first game, which serves as the central hub, boasting various facilities to use to earn a living as a Rancher. While the game doesn't adequately explain how players can use these facilities, the Fabricator and the Refinery being such examples, it took until reaching Day 43 to figure out how to use them both.</p>

<p>The Refinery functions as a deposit for various resources like Plorts and other valuable items before they can be used for crafting gadgets via the Fabricator, the latter allowing Bea to craft using blueprints before she can equip and use them. Our picks for gadgets to prioritize first are the Resource Harvester, Jetpack, and the Tank Booster, which the harvester lets Bea acquire items from nodes found throughout the island, the Jetpack for easier traversal, and the Tank Booster to carry and store more resources in inventory slots.</p>

<p>Exploration in <em>Slime Rancher 2 </em>is your best friend, and understanding each area and its biome, and detailing what resources can be acquired, will go a long way. It's worth stating that for each day spent on Rainbow Island, collect as many resources as possible, especially if Bea can't place them in the Garden to grow, as Bea may need them to feed various Plorts, like the Cuberries for the Phosphor Slime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-549.jpg?itok=9P9539-H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-549.jpg?itok=aLrYLnIF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pay attention to every slime's favorite food, like Phosphor Slime&nbsp;loves Cubberies.&nbsp;<em>(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Your gadgets are equally important, too, especially the Jetpack, which allows Bea to cover greater distances and find items that are harder to reach by jumping higher and gliding for a brief time. The Jetpack will be a great gadget for exploration, but a drive must be found first, and then its upgrade must be purchased before crafting it at the Fabricator with the required resources and spending Newbucks.</p>

<p>The game's UI design is simple, clean, and very legible, which is pleasing to the eye, especially since every game element, such as the inventory slots, in-game prompts, and the Health and Energy meters, is clearly identifiable. Additionally, all items held in the inventory slots are clearly and largely displayed, which is a significant UI improvement and indeed user-friendly.</p>

<h2>Slimed Out!</h2>

<p>With massive improvements and overhauls to the game's visuals and UI designs, a fun and cozy gameplay loop, and a new location to explore to one's content, some game aspects do hold the game back from being a great sequel. While not having played the original game and putting in the work and hours wrangling slimes and establishing the Ranch, the overall story is less compelling to follow along.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-598.jpg?itok=ZEFgGnm5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-598.jpg?itok=AvrEKZYl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Beatrix's friends from the first Slime rancher game will leave messages for her which are accessed via the&nbsp;Comm Station in the Conservatory.&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>It does heavily rely on various NPCs that Bea established connections with from the first game, and communication with these characters is limited to video call messages. Their messages don't contribute much to the ongoing story, but equally disappointing is that these characters' stories don't progress or expand in the sequel, and at times, their appearance can be nonsensical or overbearing, but we love the gifts they share with Bea.</p>

<p>Staying with familiar NPCs that Bea reconnects with in the sequel, the game doesn't introduce new characters for her to meet that could contribute something meaningful to her journey and exploration on Rainbow Island. This excludes the new Research Drones that provide Bea with new lore for the new location that Bea can find in most areas, excluding the Grey Labyrinth and the Slime Sea, but even so, it takes a while for the lore drops to be paid off.</p>

<p>While the game's story isn't heavily emphasized, the exploration is, as there's so much of the world that can be explored, and it doesn't need every gadget to advance to the next area. However, while unlocking these new areas is gated by Gordo Slimes that Bea must feed to unblock the passages, it's reaching the endgame areas that are restricted by specific requirements, and farming for these materials can be pretty time-consuming and frustrating.</p>

<p>This can take up much of players' time locating the resources required and crafting specific gadgets to progress, before finding the hidden gates to solve the door's puzzles. Grinding for these resources makes <em>Slime Rancher 2's</em> endgame feel tedious and less thrilling, especially for those wanting to reach the game's end and to see the big story/lore payoff, but for others who enjoy the exploration and ranching more, this won't be a major concern, as there's plenty of content to enjoy until reaching those final moments.</p>

<h2><em>Slime Rancher 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-630.jpg?itok=yJqBGH4w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-630.jpg?itok=3fq766fL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The game's developer made significant improvements to Slime Rancher 2 such as the game's visuals which makes exploring in the day and night incredibly vibrant.&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developer Monomi Park had the blueprint to build <em>Slime Rancher's</em> sequel, leaving room to create new, innovative features and content that would expand on what they had first achieved with the original game. They didn't need to change much of the formula, like the gameplay loop, as many of the improvements saw massive overhauls to its visuals, as the environments feel more lush and vibrant, and the textures are exquisitely clean, especially with more biome varieties present in <em>Slime Rancher 2</em>.</p>

<p>All in all, what the developer set out to achieve with <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> should be widely praised for, as the vast changes to the game's visuals are absolutely stunning and vibrant, from the vistas to the wiggly slimes we encounter. The improvements to the UI are greatly appreciated, and the diversity of biomes and areas makes exploration extremely rewarding and exciting, as no two areas feel or look the same, even if the gameplay loop can be repetitive for players.</p>

<p>Where the game lacks is the opportunity to flesh out further or expand the story, leaving much to be desired. Sure, we have some of our returning companions to aid Bea during her adventures on Rainbow Island, but at times, they add or offer so little that it makes their presence feel more like fan service than one of substance, and their interactions something that can be avoided when there's so much of the world and gameplay content more worthwhile to explore.</p>
