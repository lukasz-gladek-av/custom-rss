			<p>Obsidian has <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1923067990796361892">announced</a> the 2025 roadmap for Avowed, which consists of three big updates for the rest of the year, the first of which is out now with update 1.4.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, Avowed will include a new game-plus mode, a photo mode, NPCs will have new abilities and behaviors, players will get new character presets, Godlike features, weapons, and the ability to change your appearance in the world. But that's all to come in the Summer and Fall 2025 updates.</p>
<p>As for today's Spring 2025 update with patch 1.4, Obsidian has added an arachnophobia mode, mouse and keyboard support for Xbox console players, fog of war improvements, more gold and crafting materials, and a slew of bug fixes and other tweaks that Obsidian gets into in the<a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/"> full patch notes</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">blog post</a> about the roadmap and today's update on its website, Obsidian also called out that it is working to add localized language versions of Avowed for Korean, Japanese, and French-speaking players. The studio doesn't say when those versions will be available, but is "<em>committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo</a> enjoyed Avowed when it arrived earlier this year, saying in his review that Avowed "<em>marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds</em>."</p>
<p>And soon we'll know just how significant it is with direct comparison to Obsidian's next game, The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to release on June 8, 2025.</p>

Want to give your pig a frolic break? Simply remove the saddle by shearing it. It’ll pop off, ready to be stored, put on another mount, or pointlessly carried in your inventory until you remember it’s there.”</p><p>While some longtime players have joked that saddles and riding horses are worthless as there are faster ways to move around <em>Minecraft</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1klxpqe/i_see_people_praising_this_change_so_much_but_did/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1klxpqe/i_see_people_praising_this_change_so_much_but_did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many were still happy to see craftable saddles finally be added</a></span>. It just always seemed so silly that players could build castles, swords, armor, and more, but not a simple saddle. And this new saddle recipe is pretty easy to put together, so new players or folks starting new worlds can now start using horses to get around sooner and without relying on luck. Truly the end of an era. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Obsidian isn't resting on its laurels, however, as the studio has released a full roadmap for the rest of 2025 that includes some juicy additions to the open-world adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spring update, Update 1.4, released today on Xbox and PC. It adds improvements to the map's fog of war mechanics, an Arachnophobia Safe Mode for players who hate spiders, and support for a mouse and keyboard control scheme on Xbox, among other things. Today's patch also allows players to wait at the Party Camp to pass in-game time, view chests on the minimap, or perform a new cancel ability with Bow and Arquebus power attacks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798"></a><figcaption>Avowed Roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead to the rest of the year, the Summer patch will bring improvements to cooking and crafting, custom map markers, and new NPC abilities and behaviors throughout.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/nintendo-has-a-plan-for-continuous-flow-of-switch-2-through-the-holidays<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’re just three weeks away from the launch of the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the sequel to the second-best-selling console in the company’s history. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa announced last week that it forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units worldwide and another 4.5 million units of the original Switch during the current fiscal year. Despite many fans out there unable to secure a preorder for the upcoming console, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser says the company plans to keep the Switch 2 available through the holidays.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-san-francisco-interview-with-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser"><em>IGN</em></a> to discuss the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gallery/2025/05/15/nintendo-store-san-francisco-photo-tour">new Nintendo store</a> opening up next week in San Francisco, California, Bowser discussed this forecast and what it means for Switch 2 supply over the coming months. When asked by<em> IGN</em> if Nintendo will be able to meet demand in the U.S. at launch, Bowser explained the company believes it will be able to do so.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“That forecast [Furukawa’s 15 million units sold] was really driven by wanting to match, if you will, what we accomplished with Nintendo Switch in the first 10 months of its release,” Bowser told <em>IGN</em>. “As we look at our plans here in the U.S., we do believe we’ll have production and supply that will allow us to meet consumer demand.</p><p>“We know there’s been strong positive reaction to Nintendo Switch 2 early on and we’ve seen that through our preorders, but we do have a plan to have a continuous flow of product that’ll be available through the holidays.”</p><p><em>IGN</em> then asks Bowser about the price and whether people unable to secure a Switch 2 around launch should be concerned about possible price increases in the future due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s shifting policies around tariffs. Bowser says Nintendo made a commitment by announcing the price of Switch 2, but notes that the situation is still in flux.</p>

<p>“Well, we made a commitment by announcing the price of both the single SKU at $449 and then the bundled SKU with Mario Kart World at $499,” Bowser said. “And we really thought it was important that we established that price point, even after further tariffs were announced, to give consumers that comfort that they would be able to purchase at that price point. Obviously, it’s still a very fluid situation and it’s difficult to determine what may be happening in the upcoming months or weeks.</p><p>“But our commitment is to find ways within existing market conditions or changing market conditions to make our products, including Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, as obtainable as we possibly can.”</p><p>The rest of the <em>IGN</em> interview is a great read and covers a variety of topics so be sure to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-san-francisco-interview-with-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser">check it out</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-protocol-gets-a-pseudo-revival-in-star-resonance-later-this-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> may have been shut down last year, but it lives on in a new form now with Blue Protocol: Star Resonance. Publisher A Plus unveiled the new MMORPG today, and it's set for launch sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is an anime-inspired MMORPG, with action combat and an open world to explore, targeting PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as iOS and Android. Currently, the game is set to launch in Europe, North America, and Latin America sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/free-to-play-mmorrpg-blue-protocol-star-resonance-coming-west-in-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gematsu</a>, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was previously only announced for China. It was licensed to Bokura, the developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after the closure of Blue Protocol</a> and picked up some members of the original team in the process. Now, Star Resonance looks to be heading to new territories.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd be forgiven for thinking Blue Protcol: Star Resonance is the original Blue Protocol, as the gameplay and world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_qVWHiHnQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look very similar</a>. The original Blue Protocol was a collaboration between Amazon Games and Bandai Namco. The MMORPG went live in Japan and was planned for a worldwide release. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-protocol-preview-living-out-my-anime-action-dreams">IGN even previewed it in 2023</a>, calling it "gorgeous" and "cool."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/worldwide-release-cancelled-for-amazon-games-live-service-mmo-blue-protocol">Bandai Namco announced it was cancelling the worldwide launch</a> and would discontinue service for Blue Protocol by January 18, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world,” Bandai Namco said in a statement at the time. “We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cut to now, and Blue Protocol: Star Resonance bears all the hallmarks of Blue Protocol. There's the anime-inspired aesthetic, action combat, character customization, and community events. This, in essence, may just be the return of Blue Protocol for those who were interested in seeing it arrive in the west.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this news might feel like seeing the ghost of old games past, it might be some good news for anyone who didn't get the chance to try Blue Protocol before its closure. Maybe the second time's the charm? We'll know for sure when Blue Protocol: Star Resonance arrives sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-fond-farewell-to-polygon-from-the-people-who-worked-there.1190559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Polygon is not dead, but under new owner Valnet, it has been forcefully contorted into something it wasn’t even just a few weeks ago. Websites are their people; <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off the majority of a site’s staff</a> is akin to molting skin and bones – and keeping only a name. So while Polygon persists, we still feel like now is an appropriate time to give former staff a chance to eulogize what was. Let’s join them in saying goodbye to an era.</p><p>Matt Leone, former special projects editor (2012-2025):</p><blockquote><p>I spent a little over 13 years at Polygon, which I think was the longest uninterrupted stretch there of anyone apart from Chris Grant, who founded the site and was the primary reason it did so well for so long.</p><p>I wrote <a href="https://rooftopshouting.com/2025/05/07/polygon-memories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a longer thing</a> about this on my personal site, but the thing I loved most about the job was we had enough bandwidth to chase projects we wanted to do, even if they weren’t always huge traffic wins. It was a big enough machine that we could spend a few months on a feature and justify that because it helped the site’s overall reputation/brand/etc., rather than because of some calculation that the time spent equaled the number of times people clicked on it. That changed a bit as time went on, but I’ll always be grateful to have worked for a place with that sort of flexibility, and to have worked for people who cared about the editorial and not just the numbers.</p><p>I’m also in the early stages of starting a new thing, so if the Aftermath folks don’t consider this too self-promotional and leave it in, follow <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattleone.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@mattleone.bsky.social</a> for updates!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Samit Sarkar, former deputy managing editor (2012-2025):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>One of my favorite aspects of the Polygon that we all knew and loved — the Polygon that I worked at for just shy of 13 years — is that right up until the very end, it felt like we had a decent amount of freedom to just... try things. (I mean that as a whole, and for each person on staff.) If you look at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/authors/samit-sarkar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">author page</a> for pretty much anybody who was on our team, you're likely to find articles on a wide variety of topics in an assortment of formats, including some big swings, beat reporting, aborted projects, unhinged takes, low-hanging fruit, and wow-this-is-one-of-the-best-pieces-I've-read-in-ages stuff. The goal, above all else, was always to make cool shit. I think the work speaks for itself.</p><p>Polygon had been around long enough to be considered an institution, I'd say, but it wasn't a place that homogenized everything into an institutional voice. Instead, its output was a direct product of the particular people who were there — a reflection of the individual voices on the team, and their own backgrounds, quirks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23972518/motion-smoothing-tv-explained-how-to-turn-it-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hobbyhorses</a>, and skill sets. Look, I'm not saying that we were immune from the pressures of late capitalism or mid-2020s web publishing; obviously, as a website operating at the scale we were operating at, we had to find a middle ground between complete editorial freedom and, well, the trend-/traffic-chasing strategies that the post-sale Polygon will likely rely on. It often felt like we were <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23284152/jeopardy-regular-virginia-callback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting away with something</a>.</p><p>Anyway: The thing that I will miss most about Polygon is, of course, the people. I loved working with the beautiful menagerie of humans who made Polygon what it was, particularly because I don't know that such an assemblage of people could've come together under any other circumstances at any other time or place. (Sure, I guess that's true of a lot of workplaces, but sue me — it feels more true to me about Polygon, especially now that so many of us are facing the prospect of having to find work elsewhere.)&nbsp;</p><p>It was a good website. I doubt I'll ever find a place like it for the rest of my career. So it goes.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Susana Polo, former senior entertainment writer (2015-2025):</p><blockquote><p>With the caveat that there's no adequate way to sum up a decade in a few sentences... Polygon was the work, of course — hard and rewarding and exciting and just as importantly, often silly and creative. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452864/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some</a> of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/2019/7/26/8931603/rebecca-sugar-steven-universe-movie-future-goofy-movie-comic-con-sdcc-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coolest</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj4hXiVl758&amp;list=PLaDrN74SfdT57sJQWZnYzszZER-Pvsb5x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuff</a> I've <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/21540788/horse-girl-canon-movies-books-tv-shows-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">done</a> in my <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/year-of-the-ring-susana-polo/21011667?ean=9798886635553&amp;next=t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life</a> (my professional and non-professional life!) I got to do for Polygon. Polygon was also the people, talented and funny and kind and smart and dedicated and just as importantly often silly and sappy.&nbsp;</p><p>Polygon taught me what it was like to work for a place that understood my enthusiasm, expertise, and principles as something to be respected and valued, rather than exploited. It taught me what it's like not just to work with but to work for people who are smart and give a fuck about the work and the audience and importance of what we were doing and how we did it. That our jobs were not just to entertain or distract or mesmerize, but to inform and enrich, in a niche of a niche of an industry where it's so easy to lose that drive or get capitalistically crammed into a box with no room for it. Working at Polygon taught me that I should never settle for less than that, and it's probably the thing I'm most worried that I'll never find again.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Ryan Gilliam, former guides producer (2016-2025):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I grew up at Polygon. I was a watcher in college when the first Vox gaming documentary-style videos came out, I was a reader in my dorm room the day the website officially launched, and I was an employee of nearly a decade when the site — as we know it — died.</p><p>Working at Polygon is all I ever wanted to do, and I spent every day that I was there trying to honor the fact that I’d been given an opportunity to work at a dream job. It was challenging and frequently frustrating, but I learned from the most talented people out there, and I’m so unbelievably proud of not only the prestige work I was able to publish — like GOTY essays or reviews — but my day-to-day guides work as well.</p><p>Sometimes it’s tough to work in something fun like games, because when the world crumbles around you, it all starts to feel a little meaningless. But — stupid as it sounds — I always tried to tell myself that, with our guides, we were helping people enjoy their hobby a little more, and make their game time a little more relaxing. I wasn’t making a difference in my 9 to 5, but in my head, there were people who were making a difference who would come home and try to relax for a few hours before getting back out there. And in those moments of relaxation, they’d pull up a Polygon guide for <em>Persona 5</em> classroom answers, or a walkthrough on how to get the latest <em>Destiny</em> Exotic. I don’t know if that ever happened, but the thought always made me smile.</p><p>Polygon was a good website. And it was a good home for the time we had it. I’ll miss it — and the people who made it Polygon — every day.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Clayton Ashley, former senior video editor (2016-2025):</p><blockquote><p>Polygon wasn’t perfect, but what job is? And what gaming outlet would give me time and money to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFYBsnVfT-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a feature length documentary on the Cold War and a 1996 video game</a> hardly anyone has heard of? Since 2018 at least, the video team was guided simply by our curiosity: we made videos about things that interested us, going down rabbit holes and interviewing smart people. I never expected to speak with art historians, city planners, folk musicians, or composers&nbsp; for my job at a video game website. We wanted to share what we’d learned with our audience with the same genuine excitement that you’d share that fact with your friends. I think, for the most part, we accomplished that.</p><p>I know I was incredibly lucky to have my role for nearly nine years (which is three times longer than anywhere else I’ve been). What I’ll miss most are the people I worked with: freakishly creative, hardworking, thoughtful, and kind. I don’t know if I’ll ever feel as collaborative and in sync as I did with my team at Polygon. We brainstormed ideas together, critiqued each other's scripts, and worked late into the night on charity livestreams. Even when we had sponsored videos we “had to” work on, the team made every effort to deliver something we felt good about and our audience would enjoy. It’s frustrating to know that our own success may have contributed to our fate, but I’ll always be proud of what we accomplished.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Cass Marshall, former games writer (2017-2025):</p><blockquote><p>Polygon was a job, and it had all of the usual frustrations of a job, but it was my dream career nonetheless. I loved working with so many curious, insightful writers who were deeply invested in their beats. I got to work with some of the sharpest and most thoughtful editors in the business, and they helped hone my craft. I'm incredibly grateful I had the chance to work with these people every day. I talked to tons of devs and had great conversations. We got to cover indie games, and our own personal passions, and stuff that wasn't solely based on chasing traffic numbers. </p><p>I'm devastated to be moving on; I'll miss getting to write deeply silly pieces and tossing ideas back and forth with the team. I would have stayed for as long as the site existed and my best wishes are with those who remain under Valnet. Polyon forever. Solidarity forever.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Petrana Radulovic, former entertainment reporter (2018-2025):</p><blockquote><p>At Polygon, I wanted to cover the things I loved in the same way I would gush about them over Tumblr and with my friends. And I also wanted to branch out our coverage, let people know that there are huge, thriving, unabashedly geeky fandoms for stuff like Jane Austen, romantic comedies, and visual novel mobile games — stuff that usually doesn’t get a place in mainstream geek coverage.</p><p>Sometimes that meant being silly. Sometimes that meant being serious. Sometimes that meant taking a very silly thing very seriously. I’m thankful for all the editors that let me infuse my voice into my writing and helped me shape what that voice was, and for all the writers I got to work with, who inspired me every day. Polygon really embraced that individuality and let writers’ voices and perspectives shine and I’m just really happy I got to be a part of that and help mold it into a truly special space.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Andrew Melnizek, former general manager (2018-2025):</p><blockquote><p>There are so many memories from my time at Polygon that I’ll carry with me. But more than any specific feature, video, cultural analysis, or special package we created as a team, what I’ll remember most is how we challenged the conversation -- not just within games, but across the broader entertainment culture. We didn’t just push the conversation forward, we worked to guide and welcome new audiences into the communities we loved most.</p><p>As General Manager on the business side of Polygon, my main responsibility was to help drive that conversation in innovative ways with partners and advertisers -- challenging the status quo and correcting misconceptions held by some of the world’s largest consumer brands and their leadership about the gaming community at large. I often found myself explaining that this is where mainstream culture is born. So many trends start within gaming communities, gain momentum, and eventually become the norm.</p><p>In my parting note to the team, I thanked them for creatively inspiring me every day and for helping me grow -- not only as an executive in the media industry but also personally, from so many different angles. And at its core, that’s what Polygon has always been about: the many angles of the medium and communities we love so deeply.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Nicole Carpenter, former senior reporter (2019-2025):</p><blockquote><p>I’ve had a lot of weird jobs. I worked as a baker in a vegan diner. I walked dogs in a ritzy Boston neighborhood. Tweaked layouts of boring technical manuals. I didn’t know what I wanted to do as a profession for a very long time. I started college in my early-to-mid-20s and started thinking about what it’d be like to be a journalist after I got involved in my college’s paper. Polygon had been founded shortly before. I took a digital media course, and we were instructed to write as if we worked for a specific outlet of our choosing. Mine was Polygon.</p><p>All this is to say, Polygon was my dream job. I wanted to write for a publication that allowed me to be curious, thoughtful, compassionate, and meticulous in my reporting. It felt like there was space for writing I wouldn’t find elsewhere. And, thanks to the Vox Media Union, I was compensated fairly for it. It’s a place where every day I was awed by the work my coworkers were doing. You could come to Polygon and find work that no one else was doing, whether it’s culture reporting on <em>Roblox</em>, rigorous analysis of a ride at Disney, or a hilarious blog about a big dumb horse. I’m still in shock they laid us all off.</p><p>I’m the writer and reporter I am because of my colleagues at Polygon. I keep reminding myself that; Polygon isn’t responsible for all the incredible work we did, how much we grew together and independently. We’re the reason. We’re the reason Polygon’s work was so celebrated. Yet, what’s happened is still devastating. It’s thrown dozens of people’s lives into chaos. I’m scared. I’m sure a lot of us are. There is a bright spot in all of this, and that’s knowing my colleagues have my back, as I have theirs. The Vox Media Union has been incredible in this transition, too. The GoFundMe really, really touched me. It’s helped me realize just how much people care about us and our work. It’s really nice.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Toussaint Egan, former curation editor (2021-2025):</p><blockquote><p>I worked at Polygon for over four and a half years. It was my first staff job at a major publication after over six years of freelancing, and my first real job coming out of grad school. I received my spoken job offer on the day of my final interview, which just so happened to be the day of the Capitol riot.&nbsp;</p><p>For all these reasons and more, my time with Polygon will always mark a very special and important chapter in my career and my life. Every job has its ups and downs — that's the nature of all employment — but for a time, my time as an associate curation editor and later curation editor proper for the site was the best job I ever had. I will miss my time there, but I’m ready to move on. My only regret was that it had to end this way.</p><p>It’s difficult for me to encapsulate all the work that I'm most proud of over the past four years. I flew to Japan to cover the Crunchyroll Anime Awards; I interviewed Michael B. Jordan, Megan thee Stallion, and Joaquim Dos Santos, the co-director of <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em>; I curated an annual, month-long, Halloween-themed marathon of horror movies, TV, and media that became one of the site’s biggest traffic-driving tentpoles. All the while, I grew as a writer, an editor, and as a person.</p><p>In what would turn out to be my last month at Polygon, I interviewed Shinichirō Watanabe, Kazuya Tsurumaki, Flying Lotus (for the third time in my career!), and Bonobo, one of my all-time favorite electronic musicians. All of which is to say that: If I had to be laid off at any point in my time at Polygon, I'm proud that it was this month, because I know in my heart of hearts that I blew the hinges off the door on my way out. In true Spike Spiegel fashion, I ended things off with a bang.</p><p>If you were to ask me, right this instant, what I'm most proud of, it's the connections and friendships I made between peers, freelance colleagues, and industry professionals who reached out personally to offer their condolences, as well as the myriad of artists and creators who trusted me with their stories over the past four years. For that, I am eternally humbled and forever thankful. This is the end of a chapter, but it is far from the end of my journey. I look forward to writing and sharing more stories with readers in the months ahead as I move into what I call the “Luthen Rael/Cayce Pollard” era of my career. As the Axis spymaster of the Rebel Alliance once said, “I have friends everywhere.” The motto, as always, is onward and upward.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Ana Diaz, former culture writer (2021-2025):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When I was 13 I ran a modestly popular Nintendo blog on Tumblr dedicated to sharing cutesy and goofy edited screenshots and gifs of series like <em>Pokémon </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. I am still very proud of the success of that blog and can trace certain reaction gifs of Link now linked on chatting apps back to that same blog. However, I gave it up after a high school counselor told me it wouldn’t help me or my future at college.&nbsp;</p><p>In the classic way that narrow-minded authority figures can be, that counselor was wrong and I never knew that person was more wrong when I started work at Polygon.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, Polygon was an inherent recognition of what I felt all along: That video games, the people who make them, and the fandoms they inspire are important and worthy of being examined in writing. Suddenly when I was at Polygon, I was surrounded by people who felt the same. There was literally no other place I wanted to write for, because I knew my interests wouldn’t be otherized or seen as niche at Polygon. I got to write about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22412417/barnes-noble-manga-shojo-books-my-hero-academia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weebs in Barnes &amp; Noble</a> and read about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23485977/video-game-unions-guide-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game unions</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/21331611/underrated-animated-movies-box-office-bombs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved failures in animation</a>, and use the site to check <a href="https://www.polygon.com/honkai-star-rail-guides/505630/amphoreus-treasure-chests-spirithief-locations-maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest locations in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, I can’t capture what Polygon means to me in a matter of a few paragraphs. In a sense, I felt like I “grew up” there. My writing has improved so tremendously under the direction of editors like Nicole Clark, Maddy Myers, Zosha Millman, and Kallie Plagge. But as growing up often is, working at Polygon also came with its own pains.&nbsp;</p><p>I cared deeply about my colleagues and the work, and it was easy to get a bit too riled up, or at times, not riled up enough. Also, writing all the time is <em>hard</em>. I am pretty sure that I will go down in history as Polygon’s slowest news writer. (McWhertor, if you’re reading this just know that I tried my best.) I, like many writers, dealt with a plucking anxiety pang that told me I was not good enough, an anxiety that Chris Plante tried to swat away like a fly at every single one-on-one we ever had.</p><p>With time, I didn’t age like a fine wine but more like some juice that gained a bit of fizz after being opened and sitting too long in the back of the fridge. For me, Polygon (at its best) was a bubbly site that allowed us to have a bit of fun, and I for one will choose to remember it as the place where I got to write about a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/15/22331825/super-mario-3d-world-cum-pipe-meme-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario cum pipe meme</a>.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Kallie Plagge, former senior copy editor (2022-2025):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Work shouldn’t be your whole life, but honestly, Polygon was where I felt most like myself. I’m a very in-the-weeds kind of person, and having hyper-specific knowledge about very niche things was sort of the whole job. Copy editing, in terms of checking a piece of writing for spelling and grammar and style (and sensitivity), was one part of that; the other part was being able to catch an error simply because I happened to know a <em>Pokémon</em> fact off the top of my head, or because I know to check whether a particular <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> character is actually new or if they first appeared in a game that was never officially localized into English.</p><p>This… quality? skill? flaw? doesn’t always come across well to people, even though it’s more about liking knowledge than simply Wanting to Be Right. But I really felt like my friends and colleagues at Polygon truly valued what I had to offer in service of making each piece the best it could be, and ensuring readers could focus on what we had to say instead of nitpicking any one detail or turn of phrase. If just one person felt better about publishing a big story or vulnerable piece knowing I’d looked it over with that very specific fine-toothed comb, then I could feel good about myself and my contribution to the team.</p><p>But more importantly, I got to learn new things every day from people who were equally passionate and knowledgeable about equally niche stuff. I got to have fun, in-the-weeds conversations every day with people who understood why I liked having them, and whose skills and work I really respect. I’m leaving Polygon more confident in myself than when I started, and it’s largely thanks to the relationships I developed there (and especially to Samit, the best manager I could’ve asked for). I get to keep the friends I made at Polygon, of course — but I’m just really, really sad I don’t get to work with them every day anymore.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Pete Volk, former senior curation editor (2022-2025):</p><blockquote><p>I was a fan of Polygon long before I worked there. I started my career covering sports at Polygon’s sister site SB Nation. During my nearly 10 years at SB Nation, Polygon was the only other Vox Media website I read regularly, because the personality of the people who worked there jumped off the page. Before I got to work with them, I loved reading Petrana Radulovic and Maddy Myers and Nicole Carpenter and whatever Cass Marshall was getting up to on any particular day (and so many other people!), and I loved the excellent video team and their approach. There was so much on Polygon that made me laugh, but that was all alongside important reporting work and stories that made me a more informed reader and participant in the culture.</p><p>That’s why I targeted Polygon as my next spot after SB Nation, and I am so grateful I was able to work there for more than three years. As the lead of our curation section, I tried to embrace the curiosity and light tone that made Polygon such an appealing destination for me, introducing people to movies, TV shows, or games they might never have heard of in ways that gave them proper context around the title and hopefully made them laugh a little.&nbsp;</p><p>And I was grateful for the opportunity to take big swings on stories that I felt passionate about, like this piece I worked with a group of excellent freelancers on about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23729939/greatest-black-action-stars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Black action star pantheon</a>, or the oral history I wrote on DTV action masterpiece <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/450051/blood-and-bone-oral-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Blood and Bone</em></a>. <em>Blood and Bone</em> is one of my favorite movies of all time, but not exactly one that felt like a perfect fit for Polygon’s audience – nevertheless, I was able to make time to report that story for more than a year. At its best, Polygon encouraged the people who worked there to embrace what they were passionate about, and share that passion with the audience – during my time with the site, I was able to cover action movies, esports, and sports games: all passions of mine, even though they rarely intersected with my actual job.</p><p>I’m proud of the work I did there and the skills I honed, but what I’m really going to miss is the people I worked with, who I learned so much from and made me better every day. There was a real sense of camaraderie among the people that created the stories that made Polygon what it was, and while I know the friendships I made there will last, I will miss the environment that put us all together, and I can’t help but be bitter that success couldn’t save us from the vultures who seem to make every important decision in our society these days.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m particularly grateful for the time I was able to spend with the great people on the curation team: Toussaint Egan, Austen Goslin, and (briefly) Nicole Clark, who are all so dedicated and talented and made coming to work every day a treat. And I will deeply miss the Vox Media Union – being a part of the original organizing and bargaining committees is the thing I’m most proud of during my time at the company. The relationships forged in that fire will last a lifetime, and the gains we made in that negotiation mean that I and my other former co-workers received more severance than the company would have ever given us on its own accord.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sour-patch-kids-flavor-rankings"><h3>Sour Patch Kids, Ranked</h3></a><p>An objectively correct ranking of Sour Patch Kids and various Sour Patch Kids-flavored things</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fancy a jaunt back into The Zone? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> released the long awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> last November, steadling improving it after an (understandably) rocky launch. There's been several hefty updates for the sequel released along the way, and it turns out the developer has been even busier than expected. GSC Game World announced Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition today, a revamp of the original three games, Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat, that mostly brings in some visual upgrades.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on an <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq">FAQ</a> about the update, GSC explained that these improvements include things like enhancements to GodRays and the overall lighting system, refined surface reflections, improved 3D models for NPCs and guns, and even things like updated skyboxes. Textures have seen some upscaling too, and some aspects of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> UI has been updated to "improve usability" on both PC and console.

<p>
While they didn't specify what, there have been some tweaks to the controls to make them "more in line with current game practices" and there's some new quality of life features too, whatever they are. Full controller support is being added, and Steam Deck users will probably be happy to hear all three games have been optimised for the handheld. And there'll be cloud saves now too!
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it certainly all looks newer. I never feel particularly passionate about lighting "upgrades" like this, the vibes often feel just a little bit too different. Mostly I miss the days when games didn't have real-time lighting, a lot of games just kind of look the same now. Ah well, at least the base of it is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
This new update is coming May 20th, just a few days away, and for some added good news, this'll be a free update. The revamped version of the individual games will be listed separately in your library, so if you're averse to the modern world, you'll still be able to play as normal. Happy zoning!

<p dir="ltr">"This is a commonly requested feature from Season 7 that has been brought back into the game to help players save time on Whisper events," Diablo community manager Adam Fletcher said in a post on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/patch-221-raven-of-the-trees-now-found-in-each-major-town/222502" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forums</a>. "This was originally missing from the patch notes, but we will be updating the notes to include this feature."</p><p dir="ltr">It might not sound like much, but being able to turn in Whisper bounties in major cities where players likely are already spending their time significantly speeds up the entire bounty running process. Instead of completing 10 bounties, having to navigate to the map, travel to the Tree of Whispers, turn in, and then teleport back to their previous location, players can simply travel to a nearby town and turn it in immediately, or wait for when they are already in town doing various other activities to do it then.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature has since been added to the official <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24196854/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> with a comment from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">"We recognized that backtracking to the tree to turn in Whispers made for a bloated gameplay loop," the patch notes read. "A Raven of the Tree was added to each capital city to cut down on turn in time."</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes in the update, numerous Spiritborn skills and passives have received buffs, along with buffs for multiple Druid passives and some significant damage increases for Barbarian items like Ghor's Devastating Grips and Twin Strikes.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been a few season-specific improvements as well. The boss power Sinerat's Flame received a 25% damage buff, and Apparition Incursions are now both easier to find on the map and spawn Betraying Eyes, needed for some seasonal journey objectives, more consistently. For more details on what all is included in update 2.2.1, be sure to read the full patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 8 started April 29 and brought major, permanent changes to the ARPG's endgame bosses, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">making them stronger but more rewarding</a>. Blizzard additionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">reworked Diablo 4's battle pass system</a>, a change that, while better in some ways, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">didn't exactly go over well with players</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Diablo 4 also crossed over with Berserk</a> for Season 8, and while there are some free rewards for players to earn, the crossover largely feels like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">huge wasted opportunity</a>.</p>

With its disturbing claymation art style, unique and compelling mechanics, and utterly beautiful soundtrack, it’s one of 2025's must-play indie titles. From beginning to end, this intriguing horror-themed expedition subverts expectations by pulling at your heartstrings just as much, if not more, than it tries to make you jump. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197564,197562" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But despite my high praise, you should be aware that <em>The Midnight Walk</em> is a fairly brief title with limited replayability, so you’ll want to be sure that it’s the kind of game that speaks to you. If you’re curious just <em>how</em> long <em>The Midnight Walk</em> takes to beat, let’s dive into it.</p><h2 id="h390380"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to finish <em>The Midnight Walk</em>?</h2><p><strong><em>The Midnight Walk</em> is a short game that should take most folks</strong> <strong>around 4-5 hours to finish</strong>. This makes it an excellent choice for a single long evening where you can connect fully to the game’s unsettling but affecting story. While its short campaign and straightforward level design leave few reasons to see it through more than once, rest assured that great pacing and inventive gameplay ensure that not a single moment of those few hours is wasted.</p><p>Additionally, though <em>The Midnight Walk</em> is linear with only minimal unused space, it manages to do a fantastic job of hiding collectibles just out of sight in ways that require you to thoroughly explore your surroundings. With this in mind, completionists should have a good time rounding up every clay figure, gramophone disc, and shellphone (audio log) in the game. </p><p>To make things easier, there’s also a chapter select feature, which allows you to replay the sections of the game housing any collectibles you missed. And you can always visit Housy, a walking house that acts as a hub throughout your journey, to check and see which ones you’re missing so that you’re not wasting time retracing your steps through chapters unnecessarily. </p><p>Whether you’re looking to just absorb the emotional tale in <em>The Midnight Walk</em> or want to search for every collectible so you can earn all the game’s trophies or achievements, you can jump in now on PS5, PSVR2, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It’s been three years since Sony launched its popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM5 Headphones</a>, and today it’s officially launched its successor--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM6</a>.

Early reviews are incredibly positive, with critics pointing out the headphones impeccable noise-canceling skills and ultra-comfortable design.</p><div title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3524" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony WH-1000XM6 - Noise-Canceling Wireless Headphones</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$448 at Amazon | $450 at Best Buy</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sony made two big upgrades with these new headphones. First and foremost is the new noise-cancelling processor. The QN3 is said to be seven times faster than the processor found in the XM5, resulting in enhanced active noise cancellation. Using 12 microphones, it can sense and react to noises in your environment, quickly adapting its performance to reduce ambient sound.</p><p>The other big addition is a folding design. Sony abandoned this with the XM5, and while the folding system isn’t identical to the older XM4, the end result is the same. Thanks to metal joints, you can swivel and fold the earcups, making them easy to transport in the included carrying case.</p></div>                      </div><p>You’ll get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, a wider headband for added support and comfort, and a six-microphone system that picks up and transmits crisp audio for phone calls. Of course, it also benefits from enhanced drivers, which should provide clearer audio for all your content. The headphones are available in black, midnight blue, and silver.</p><p>If you’re looking to upgrade your audio but don’t want to drop $450, both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM4</a> headphones are currently on sale. The XM5 are $348 (was $400) and the XM4 are $298 (was $348). The XM5 offer superior noise-canceling chops compared to the XM4--but they lack the ability to fold, making them a bit more cumbersome for travel or storage. The XM4 are also on sale for $50 off, though audio quality and ANC aren’t quite up to par with the newer XM5.</p><p>The XM6 essentially combines the best aspects of both headphones while also improving overall performance. Be sure to give all three a look before deciding which is best for your needs. There are plenty of other great headphones available in 2025, and you’ll find a few of our favorites below. </p><h2>More Noise-Canceling Headphones</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM4</a> -- $298 (<del>$348</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> -- $348 (<del>$400</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJC52FP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods Max</a> -- $500 (<del>$549</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort</a> -- $349</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> -- $429</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ2TBSPV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sennheiser Momentum 4</a> -- $316 (<del>$380</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Wireless-Headphones-Matte/dp/B0CZPLV566?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Solo 4</a> -- $130 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> -- $170 (<del>$350</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomtoc-releases-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-its-popular-form-fitting-travel-case/1100-6531332/">Tomtoc Releases Nintendo Switch 2 Version Of Its Popular Form-Fitting Travel Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-store-star-wars-day-sale-2025-jango-fett-ucs-starship-free-lego-sets/1100-6530872/">Lego Star Wars Day Sale Is Live - Get Two Free Sets With Jango Fett's UCS Starship</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-all-launch-games-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/1100-6531115/">All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games You Can Preorder Now</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the first of three story expansions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is out now on all platforms, alongside the game's latest 1.3 update patch, which brings a few quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and a new horse racing feature.</p>
<p>Brushes with Death is the first of three story DLCs that players can jump into if they're looking for more Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and if you bought the Gold Edition of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, or just bought the Expansion Pass separately, then when you update Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on whatever platform you own it on, the Brushes with Death DLC will be a part of that update.</p>
<p>If you just bought the base game, then you'll be able to pick up Brushes with Death individually for $5.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II | Brushes with Death Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfkJHBSNPD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Brushes with Death story sees Henry enlisted to help "<em>a mysterious artist uncover his enigmatic past.</em>" You'll travel across both maps in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's world, speaking to and occasionally fighting several new and some familiar characters throughout a number of quests to help this artist figure out his past.</p>
<p>Just last week, Warhorse Studios announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/">Kingdom Come series had surpassed 13 million copies sold</a>, with the first game breaking 10 million, and its recently released sequel surpassing 3 million copies sold.&nbsp;It's a massive milestone for Warhorse, who can easily be regarded as one of the best makers of open-world games.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,</a> our reviewer, Chris Wray, didn't have enough nice things to say about the game, saying that it is "<em>a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

                <p>Playing video games is getting more expensive these days, with companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Nintendo and Microsoft announcing plans to charge $80 for games</a>, and consumers are ready and willing to embrace the higher price points. That's according to analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raised-xbox-console-and-game-prices-analysts-say-playstation-and-everyone-else-could-be-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that with Nintendo and Xbox announcing price hikes on games, "the floodgates are now open." He expects every publisher in video games that can raise prices to do so.</p><p>"The market will bear it. Plenty of gamers are willing to pay price points above $70, as shown by the high numbers of those willing to pay $100 for a few days' early access," Elliott said.</p><p>He added that, even in challenging economic times, people will spend money on what they want the most, including video games. "The rising prices won’t necessarily reduce spending. The market will bear it. Early adopters will always be early adopters," he said.</p><p>Before this, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said entertainment is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-is-not-worried-about-global-economic-turmoil-impacting-its-games/1100-6531397/" data-ref-id="1100-6531397">"fundamental human need,"</a> and as such, he's not worried about the global economic climate negatively impacting video games.</p><p>Newzoo's Manu Rosier, meanwhile, said rising game prices may lead to shifts in how money is spent, with consumers becoming potentially "more selective" with what they buy. A consumer may respond to rising individual game prices by "spending less on individual full-priced titles and more on subscriptions, discounted bundles, or long-tail live-service games," he said.</p><p>"The total spend may remain steady or even grow modestly, but the distribution across formats and platforms will likely continue to evolve. Xbox's pricing changes, and similar moves by others, could accelerate this transition toward services and ecosystems over standalone product purchases," Rosier said.</p><p>Game prices are not going up universally, as 2K Games just announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country will go for $50</a> when it launches in August. But history shows that there have always been lower-priced games in the market at the same time as higher-priced ones. Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1921280736901882167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "$50 games in 2025 is just the new $40 games from the PS4 gen and $30 games from the PS2 gen. They've always existed and usually been the price point for titles that aren't quite AAA in nature."</p><p>Mat Piscatella of Circana added that he believes consumers may shift towards free-to-play games and other "more easily accessible forms of games."</p><p>"Games like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, etc. will likely see even more players and hours spent in their ecosystems. Players will also rely on and continue to play devices they already own a bit more rather than buy new hardware," he said. "And, as prices rise in everyday spending categories like food, gas, shelter, automotive, etc, there will be fewer and fewer dollars available for categories like gaming in the U.S."</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">first $80 game is Mario Kart World</a>, which is a launch title for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>--so far, it's the only game that Nintendo has confirmed will carry that price point. As for Microsoft, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will start charging $80 for some games later this year</a>, but the company has not said which ones.</p><p>Beyond game prices going up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft is raising Xbox prices</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">Sony might do the same</a>, in part due to the impact of tariffs. The Switch 2's $450 price point, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">is $50 more expensive than the original Switch was in 2017</a> with inflation factored in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/">Stellar Blade</a> will be out on PC in a little less than a month at this time of writing, and after it was officially announced today, pre-orders went live on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>However, players who were eager to pre-order it were met with <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-blocked-in-130-countries-devs-apparently-werent-aware.1190337/">disappointment</a> and the message that the game was unavailable in their countries. An issue that no one expected, not even the game's developer, Shift Up, <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923052833101709517">who confirmed in a post on X,</a> responding to an upset fan, that the game does not require a PSN account to play it on PC.</p>
<p>And yet, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1294088/info/">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade is marked as unavailable in <strong>130 countries</strong>, just like every other PlayStation-published game on Steam.</p>
<p>Requiring a PSN account to play PlayStation games on Steam is an issue that blew up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-no-longer-purchasable-steam-refunds/">Helldivers 2</a>, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">Sony did end up relenting in that case</a>, how it handled that whole saga, and every other PC release for PlayStation games, made it clear that PSN account sign-in is something PlayStation and Sony want in all of its PC releases.</p>
<p>Which is what makes this case all the more upsetting, because PlayStation is seemingly punishing players who live in countries where PSN isn't officially available.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there's been no official word from PlayStation on the issue, and based on the few replies the official Stellar Blade X account has given players bringing the issue to them, it seems like Shift Up has been blindsided by this. Hopefully, we'll learn more soon and will update this article as more on this comes to light.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-brings-the-phantom-thieves-to-pc-and-mobile-devices-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Atlus has revealed its free-to-play spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona5: The Phantom X</a>, is coming to PC and mobile devices June 26, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Persona series developer announced a release date for its latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a> spinoff with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsdIWTGn_Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an hour-long breakdown video</a> today. It’s being developed as part of a collaboration between Atlus, Sega, and Perfect World and reintroduces players to the Phantom Thieves along with new faces, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese and English versions of Persona5: The Phantom X will launch simultaneously next month, but this scaled-down story from the Persona 5 universe isn’t completely new. It was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-the-phantom-x-announced-for-ios-and-android">announced in 2023</a> and originally launched in China in 2024. The live-service title's developers have continued to iron out the kinks since then, and now, it’s finally ready to reach new audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Encompassed in the unique turn-based RPG gameplay and setting of <em>Persona 5</em>, players will lead a double life as a student and a Phantom Thief with a brand-new protagonist and band of Phantom Thieves,” an official description from Atlus says. “During the day, players will build up life experience as a student and engage in various activities such as hanging out with your friends and part time jobs, while at night, they will sneak into the cognitive dungeons to steal Treasures and change the twisted desires of corrupt adults!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a Persona 5 fan, you’ll be happy to know The Phantom X still features that game’s stylish turn-based gameplay. Players can also look forward to exploring jobs and extracurricular activities while enjoying new mini-games unique to this specific entry. Atlus wants you to know this is a tried-and-true Persona experience, as it confirms its involvement in writing and supervising some of the original side stories the game offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona5: The Phantom X will be viewed through the eyes of an entirely new protagonist as well as a new collection of Phantom Thieves, but Joker and other original Phantom Thieves members will show up via special contracts, too. Players will also be free to take advantage of new modes, including a PvE mode called The Velvet Trials as well as new Mementos and a new Guild feature.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Persona5: The Phantom X Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, one regret we have is that we had to take this long to be able to announce a Western release,” Sega's Jun Matsunaga said during the video presentation, “and we’re very sorry to our Western fans for keeping them in the dark for so long. As we know, this game was originally developed by Perfect World in China. When we first started to plan for a global release, for a series like Persona that is very popular in the West, we wanted to make sure that for a Western release, everything in the game from the setting to the tone of story matched the standard Western fans had for a Persona game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 launched all the way back in 2016 and has received a plethora of spinoffs since. These include crossovers with other titles such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/07/persona-5s-joker-is-coming-to-super-smash-bros-ultimate-as-dlc">Super Smash Bros.
