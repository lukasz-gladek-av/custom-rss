			<p>Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog is a classic sci-fi tale wrapped up in a visual novel. With warring factions in the Solar System, conspiracies, and relationships between crewmates aboard a small confined space of the Swift class ship known as The Gun-Dog, tensions can rise very quickly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stories from Sol:The Gun-Dog | Steam PC | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzWoEm9PFA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Stories From Sol: The Gun=Dog’s events take place after a war that rocked the Solar System. The forces of Earth, known as the Solar Federation, have been beaten by the combined forces of the Martian Territories and the Jovian Unified Colony Fleet. Your character, whose name and gender you assign, was a cadet pilot in the war and was meant to fight in the final battle piloting a Frame – essentially a mech. However, your Frame failed to launch and the rest of your squadron, bar one other pilot, were lost in the battle. A few years post-war, you find yourself as the security officer of The Gun-Dog, a ship for screw ups and others that are to be kept out of the way.</p>


<p>The Gun-Dog is a small ship, which means it has a small crew. However, among this crew your character already knows two people. The first is Cassandra, aka Cassie, the second in command and the game’s love interest. The second is Hansen, the other survivor from your former squadron, who has blamed you for the deaths of the squad mates lost in the war as you were not there when they needed you. Other characters include Captain Barthlomews, Lieutenant Vanessa Lord, Chief Engineer Cathays, Cadet Dalton, Ensign Haru, Weapons Officer Dylan, and Doctor Rosarium, the ship’s physician.</p>


<p>Some of these stand out more than others. Cassie is the strongest of the bunch, as you spend a lot of time with her as the plot unfolds, but there is also a lot of interaction and friction with Hansen and Lieutenant Lord. In fact, the developers have to be commended on Lieutenant Lord, because I have not felt such visceral hate towards a character in such a long time. The epitome of self-serving who would step on anyone to get ahead and save their own skin. It’s like Othello’s Iago was the inspiration, but at least he could feign liking Othello. Lord has no such compunction to pretend to like anyone.</p>
<p>Other characters fade into the background, having smaller parts to play. Though they are all unique, Haru is like a hanger on of Hansen, and Dylan is someone you’ll rarely interact with either. These are all decently written characters, and they do have some hidden depths to them, though you will recognise common tropes that they build upon.</p>
<p>A visual novel’s core focus is the flow of its story, and it starts off strong. The Gun-Dog is sent to assist the O’Brien after some strange readings have been detected on the edge of Jovian territory. From early on you can work out that these readings are bad news, but it takes the characters longer to reach that conclusion. What follows is a plot where you essentially becoming a detective to work out what is happening, as well as managing relationships with key characters.</p>
<p>jvbhknjUnpicking that mystery through the story is decent and interesting, but not totally unique. The ending can be impacted by some of the choices you make as well, choices in both responses you give and actions you take. &nbsp;Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog is also supposed to be the first entry into a wider universe of visual novels, so there are some story points left open at the end. I do want to see what happens next, but I don’t really feel that immediate desire to play the next instalment right away.</p>

<p>The gameplay wrapped up in the narrative is pretty straightforward. The presentation of the user interface gives six options to click on, with those being Move, Use, Look, Talk, Item and Function – all pretty self explanatory. It could arguably even just be five, as Function features a map alongside its database and task log that makes Move redundant.&nbsp;Much of the time you will be reading and interacting with the other characters, though there are some puzzles to solve to make progress. These puzzles are pretty simple to work out, so you will not be stuck in place for too long.</p>
<p>The game also has three graphic types. Doujin Mode gives you access to the early visual concept of the game with quite a cartoonish. Studio Mode looks like 90s style anime but in a green palette similar to that of the Game Boy, while Vivid Mode is like Studio Mode but in full colour. You can swap between these at any time. I switched between Vivid and Doujin mode, having used Studio during my playthrough for the preview, and ended up favouring Vivid as it gives so much more detail in the environments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will likely be priced at $399, a price point that makes the most sense for the company for several reasons, according to an in-depth analysis provided a few days ago.</p>
<p>Joost van Dreunen, co-founder of the SuperData Research firm, recently shared online<a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/nintendo-switchs-second-act"> a very interesting analysis</a> of Nintendo's strategic direction for the future, focusing on the market changes over the release of the company's previous system and how they will affect the Nintendo Switch 2. The new console, according to the analyst, enters a fundamentally different market landscape than its predecessor, and the company's approach seems to reflect this changed market, prioritizing platform sustainability rather than hardware sales. Backward compatibility and seamless transition suggest the company is focusing on installed base retention and software attachment rates, an approach that falls in line with the industry shift of recent times.</p>
<p>With this very different market landscape, Joost van Dreunen believes the Nintendo Switch 2 will be priced at $399. This price point, according to the analyst, is a critical psychological barrier that balances premium hardware aspirations against mainstream market accessibility, and that would allow Nintendo to maintain its hardware margins, position it below the handheld PC market that has blown up in recent years while clearly indicating the new system is a technological advancement, all without alienating the system's core audience. The blowing up of the handheld PC market could actually be a boon for the Nintendo Switch 2, as it has expanded the addressable audience for a portable gaming system and has a very different core audience that doesn't overlap with Nintendo's family-friendly content.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 final price and release date have yet to be announced. More information is likely coming during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>, which will finally provide a proper look at the system and its games.</p>

He’s a sexy fish man who’s a bit rogueish, with a suave voice that brings it all together. Any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan will recognize this voice as Brandon Keener, the actor behind turian vigilante Garrus Vakarian from the original trilogy. Some of my favorite reactions from <em>Avowed</em>’s early access players have been seeing them realize that Kai shares Garrus’ voice. Despite Garrus’ popularity among <em>Mass Effect </em>fans, Keener hasn’t done a ton of video game voice work in the years since. He’s done a lot of “additional voices,” but Kai is probably his most prominent role since Garrus. So for many fans, this is like hearing an old friend for the first time in over a decade.</p><p>The connection between Kai and Garrus doesn’t end in their voice actor, however. Obsidian’s writers are clearly <em>Mass Effect </em>fans, because they include a cheeky reference to Garrus in some of Kai’s dialogue. There’s a scene in <em>Avowed </em>in which a woman is challenging the player and Kai to a fight, to which the aumaua says he’s got plenty of “reach.” This seems like a reference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380">Garrus’ romance in <em>Mass Effect 2</em></a></span>, in which the character makes a joke about having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xocKGaw0kxE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xocKGaw0kxE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“reach,” and another Turian he hooked up with having “flexibility.”</a></span></p><p>It’s a fun bit of connective tissue, but Kai is a great character separate from sharing a voice with Garrus, with a depth of personality, a backstory that plays out during the game, and performs the vital role of the faithful friend you know always has your back.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This jaunty adventure jettisons the series’ typical turf war cliches and pulpy plot twists in favour of spinning a streamlined and spirited tale of seafaring and treasure hunting, without sacrificing any of the addictive diversions and slapstick silliness that have long become its hallmarks. As far as spin-offs from the mainline entries go, Pirate Yakuza makes for an absolutely invigorating seachange that left me feeling perkier than a parrot on a pirate’s shoulder.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially a coda to the events of 2024’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, Pirate Yakuza’s off-the-wall story focuses on loveable series shitstirrer, Goro Majima. It gets straight to it: after awakening on the shores of a secluded island with amnesia, he promptly befriends an enthusiastic young boy and his adorable pet tiger cub, commandeers a pirate ship that for entirely unexplained reasons seems to have sailed in straight out of the 1700s, and sets about on a thrilling quest to find the lost treasure of a legendary sunken Spanish ship. Perhaps as a result of his temporary memory loss, Majima is considerably less manic in Pirate Yakuza than he has been in previous Like a Dragon stories, but he’s still every bit as gleefully mischievous. There was never a dull moment between him and his evergrowing gang of goons turned treasure-seeking Goonies as I explored the seas and shores of Pirate Yakuza’s vibrant tropical setting. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an unpredictable voyage that regularly veers from intense highs to more laidback lows, much like the waves that Majima sails upon. In one moment I’d be trapped in a desperate battle against a towering sea creature or an army of pirates of almost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>-esque proportions, while the next I’d be adopting homeless animals off the street to shelter in my personal petting zoo and throwing parties for me hearties whenever morale amongst my crew was on the wane. Pirate Yakuza doesn’t just regularly hoist the Jolly Roger, it also lets its freak flag fly in a consistently entertaining fashion – from its rousing opening musical number through to the dynamic dance sequence that drops the curtain on its story 25 hours later – and it kept me hooked harder than a handshake from, well, Captain Hook.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nautical by Nature</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While 2023’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name">Like a Dragon Gaiden</a> experimented with a fairly superficial secret agent spin on the series’ template, Pirate Yakuza steers Like a Dragon into some truly uncharted waters. There’s plenty of lively naval combat to be enjoyed aboard Majima’s adopted pirate ship, although to be clear, in terms of exploration it doesn’t attempt to match the sense of freedom I felt in the Caribbean setting of 2013’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. Instead, Pirate Yakuza’s waters are broken down into a handful of smaller maps to warp between rather than one big open waterworld, and outside of the main Honolulu hub and a stunning ship graveyard turned casino district called Madlantis, many of the smaller islands are constructed out of the same recycled layouts. So over time, the sense of discovery slightly diminished whenever I dropped anchor and saw something a bit too familiar. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pirate Yakuza doesn’t just regularly hoist the Jolly Roger, it also lets its freak flag fly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there’s enough spectacle and strategic depth to the actual open-water combat that I remained engaged anytime I was at the helm of Majima’s ship. In each bilgewater battle you can attack front-on with machine gun fire or perform a boost-based ram into an enemy’s hull, as well as manouevre alongside a rival to deliver more damaging broadside attacks from your port or starboard cannons. These cannons can be upgraded by harvesting resources found drifting at sea or tucked around Pirate Yakuza’s smattering of ports, and although Majima’s frigate can be equipped with everything from flamethrowers to freeze guns, I soon set my sights on scraping together enough spare parts to outfit my vessel with powerful lasers to cut crossways through my opponents from ear to buccaneer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was also regularly recruiting new pirates to my crew in every port I docked in, and it quickly became clear that assigning a crew member to specific roles had measurable impacts on each naval skirmish. Individual members of your pirating posse are ranked in areas like attack, defense, and cannon power, and anytime I placed some underpowered or inexperienced comrades in, say, my boarding party, I was forced to watch my crew go from ragtag to bodybags in quick succession.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After some experimentation I eventually got the balance right, and that included determining the right pirate to be my first mate. While some candidates offered increased damage buffs or additional fuel drums to burn with my ship’s boost, I opted to promote a mechanic into the role because it gave me two extra repair kits per clash. Given I approach naval battles like Dave Chappelle approaches his stand-up sets – always on the offensive and typically blazed up by the end – it was enormously helpful to have those extra kits to haul my battlescarred hull to glory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the naval combat functions do seem a little superfluous, though. For example, at no point in the story did I feel the need to step away from the helm in order to use Majima’s rocket launcher, since the ship’s artillery usually seemed ample enough, and it was also rare that I was compelled to manually put out fires on deck or thaw out ice that was blocking my cannons. That did change, however, after I beat the story and returned to complete the 30-odd escalating battles in Madlantis’ pirate coliseum, as surviving its toughest encounters demanded the considered use of every ability at my disposal. That finally made for some welcome optional challenges outside of the main story path, but I wished they’d been in play earlier in the campaign.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Captain Hookshot</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, given that this is a Like a Dragon adventure, there are still plenty of opportunities for fisticuffs either ashore or on-deck anytime you board an enemy ship by force. In the default Mad Dog fighting stance, Pirate Yakuza reverts to the familiar brand of combo-based street fighting that was a staple of the series before the main entries shifted to turn-based brawls with 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>. Majima can pull off fast and fluid combinations of punches, kicks, and rapid dagger slashes, each attack enhanced by flashy neon movement trails and punctuated by enemies that erupt into fountains of gold coins as though they’re crowds of criminal question blocks from the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Majima feels noticeably more agile than Kazuma Kiryu ever was, with a snappier quickstep to open overbalanced enemies up to counter attack, plus the useful ability to jump and air-dodge out of harm’s way anytime he’s overwhelmed by a surprisingly numerous horde.</p><div id="how-do-you-rank-these-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How do you rank these Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio games?</h3><h3>How do you rank these Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio games?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, once I’d unlocked the Sea Dog fighting stance a few hours into my 25-hour tour of Pirate Yakuza, I basically never looked back. While in previous Like a Dragon instalments I’ve relished the freedom to switch between stances to best counter each enemy type or situation, Sea Dog is basically a one-size-fits-<em>brawl </em>fighting style that feels adaptive enough to suit any given showdown. This pirating pose allows Majima to cut loose with a pair of cutlasses, either hurling them like bladed boomerangs or performing a brutal ballet of spinning slashes to cut through enemies in clusters. It equips him with a handy hookshot that allows him to zip directly to a targeted enemy like some sort of seafaring Spider-Man, which is extremely useful for picking off the more heavily-armed goons that tend to snipe you from the far edges of each battle arena. If that’s not enough, it also gives Majima a flintlock pistol of his own, and after investing in the skill tree to increase its power and widen its radius, I was able to use it to wipe out more pirates than dysentery at the charged-up press of a button.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sea Dog is basically a one-size-fits-brawl fighting style that feels adaptive enough to suit any given showdown.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So well-rounded and entertaining to use was the Sea Dog style, in fact, that the only time I ever felt the need to switch back to Mad Dog was in order to unleash Majima’s slightly overpowered Doppelganger attack. Available after you’ve chained together enough successful attacks to fill up a special meter, this devastating ability conjures up twin Majima clones that swarm enemies and chew through their health bars for a short time like a pair of piranhas, and I was happy to have it in my back pocket for whenever I came up against one of the more brutish boss encounters. Although I think Infinite Wealth’s hybrid turn-based combat has quite rightfully become the standard for the Like a Dragon series, Pirate Yakuza’s flashy fighting remained engaging from the first sword slash through to the final throat cut, and I found it to be a substantial step up from the gadget-heavy grappling of Like a Dragon Gaiden.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pleasure Island</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Pirate Yakuza’s Honolulu setting is more or less the same sundrenched sprawl that featured in Infinite Wealth, there are enough new secrets and distractions that made it rewarding to explore a second time around. Outside of combat, Majima’s hookshot can be employed to zip him up to anchor points on certain buildings, meaning that treasure chests full of alternate character costumes and other goodies are tucked away on hotel awnings and various other elevated spots all over the island. There are also countless bounty targets to track down and beat up for beefy cash bonuses, and games for the safehouse Master System to seek out. Although, I must admit that I feel like it’s about time that developer Ryu Ga Gotoku moved on to an in-game Mega Drive (or Genesis for US fans), or at the very least a Game Gear. After collecting mostly the same set of 8-bit cartridges in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-judgment">Lost Judgment</a>, Like a Dragon Gaiden, and now Pirate Yakuza, I feel like I’ve well and truly mastered the Master System at this point. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, there’s still more: in addition to the fiend-photographing Sicko Snap and the infectiously giddy Super Crazy Delivery minigames that return from Infinite Wealth, Pirate Yakuza brings back Dragon Kart from Yakuza: Like a Dragon, only this time in addition to its riotous racing circuits they’ve bolted on an arena-based battle mode which made for some intense, four-wheeled firefights. Meanwhile, the series’ standard-issue batting cage minigame has been revitalised by swapping baseballs for cannonballs, and I had a great time knocking destructive dingers into descending stacks of explosive barrels.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was also delighted with almost every substory I completed in Majima’s adventure. Some were utterly wholesome, like the time I agreed to bring an aging businessman aboard my ship in order to live out his boyhood fantasies of becoming a pirate. Others were funny pisstakes of online culture, like when Majima was recruited to become a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-3tb">Virtua Fighter 3</a> streamer and I had to choose the liveliest possible reactions for him in order to prevent the comments section from turning too hostile. Others still were completely bonkers, like the substory that suddenly spins out into a live-action episode of a dating show inspired by The Bachelor, as the ship’s cook Masaru tried to woo five different potential dates with hilariously awkward results. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan Ogilvie's Favourite Pirate Games</h3><p>Not to be confused with pirated games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even a supersized substory that sees Majima and his ever expanding crew hunt down the dread pirate Zeus and his intimidating Devil Flags fleet. This chunky optional quest opened up additional maps to navigate, including an archipelago of volcanic islands and even an ice realm, each overloaded with increasingly powerful naval vessels to face off against and pirate headquarters to plunder. Not only is undertaking this journey worthwhile purely for harvesting the doubloons required to upgrade Majima’s ship with decked out drip – including a carved Kazuma Kiryu figurehead for its bow – but it’s also the only way to track down all four fabled instruments of the Dark Gods. These cursed instruments can be charged up during on-shore skirmishes and unleashed to spectacularly turn the tides of a battle, with a violin that brings the violence by summoning a horde of spectral land sharks to turn enemy packs into fleshy snacks, or an electric guitar that can be energetically shredded while a towering ape stomps into the fray and chimp-slaps your opponents straight into Davy Jones’ locker. These are some of the most powerful attacks in Pirate Yakuza, so it’s a little odd that they’re locked away in an entirely optional substory that’s so easy to overlook.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether your <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-games-in-order">first hunt dates back to the original game on PlayStation 2</a>, or you hopped in when 2018's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-world-sells-over-25-million">Monster Hunter: World dominated the charts</a>, you're bound to have that one monster you've grown attached to and love more than any other. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s hugely popular hunting RPG series boast over 200 monsters in total, so we've gone through them all to find our top 25 – the very best of the best, and the beasts we love to gush over as much as we hate battling them. And with Monster Hunter Wilds adding to that tally, now is the perfect time to take a look at some of the best monsters the series has to offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>25. Malzeno</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/25-malzeno-1739888223847.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Malzeno is a powerful Elder Dragon that made quite an impression when it flew onto the scene in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-rise/Sunbreak_Expansion">Monster Hunter Rise’s Sunbreak expansion</a>. This monster’s strength comes not only through its visual design, which features a glowing aura permeating throughout Malzeno’s entire body, but also its ability to literally drain the life-force from anything around it. This bloodsucking vampire of a monster is horrifying in both design and execution. Hunting it around Sunbreak’s dilapidated castle ruins only further adds to the practically gothic ambience and aesthetic, which cements Malzeno and the fight against it as a standout moment that fans won't forget anytime soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>24. Behemoth</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/24-behemoth-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to a crossover event with Final Fantasy 14, Monster Hunter World received the hulking Behemoth as a new foe for hunters to take on. Its unique mechanics, pulled from the beast’s iconic Final Fantasy moveset, make it a formidable foe. Behemoth forces you to think about party composition in the terms of a traditional MMO, designating a tank to pull aggro, a healer to keep everyone alive, and damage dealers to press the advantage. Attempting to dodge Behemoth's instant knockout Ecliptic Meteor attack still gives us nightmares to this day, but when you finally nail it, there's nothing else quite like it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>23. Vaal Hazak</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/23-vaal-hazak-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A grotesque Elder Dragon that resides in the darkest depths of the Rotten Vale, Vaal Hazak was first introduced in Monster Hunter: World, found in a den filled with a never ending sea of bones. Spewing disgusting poisonous gas from its mouth, Vaal Hazak can make quick work of any unprepared hunter. Even years after its first sighting, the mere thought of Vaal Hazak still sends shivers down our spines thanks to its red flesh-laced wings and the rotting corpses that hang from its body. Who designed this monstrosity? We just want to talk. As you can probably tell, this is not a fight for the faint of heart or someone with a weak stomach. Vaal Hazak's design and combat arena give other monsters in the series a serious run for their money. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>22. Legiana</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/22-legiana-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Chasing the speedy wyvern Legiana across the steep cliff sides of the Coral Highlands is a standout moment in Monster Hunter: World. Legiana's high speed and precision make it a deadly assassin, and learning how to dance around its icy attacks is a true test of skill. Giving this fast and fluid beast any room to maneuver can very easily spell your death. So no matter how many times you go up against it, you'll always need to stay on your toes. Legiana has a shrieking variant introduced in the Iceborne expansion, but it's the original we pay respects to here. Legiana teaches hunters about the importance of staying fleet-footed and never being overconfident. This makes Legiana a valuable teaching moment for many new hunters and a sharp reminder for veterans. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>21. Bazelgeuse</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/21-bazelgeuse-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bazelgeuse is the bane of our existence. This flying wyvern has been the cause of many late-night frustrations and trips back to camp after an entire teamwipe. If you see a Bazelgeuse flying toward you, it's probably already too late, as this incredibly aggressive apex predator actively seeks out targets across the battlefield and drops bombs on anything in its path of total destruction. Practicing patience while hunting can get lost in the shuffle as you progress further into Monster Hunter games, and Bazelguese is here to remind players the importance of waiting for the perfect moment to strike. All this means that you’d best get ready for an explosive fight, one that you probably won't forget anytime soon.. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>20. Black Diablos</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/20-black-diablos-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Diablos are not a variant of Diablos. They are actually female Diablos getting ready to mate. This causes them to become more territorial and aggressive, and so any monster or hunter that comes within their domain should approach with caution. The Black Diablos can bury itself in the sand and later erupt from underneath the desert dunes, sending anything in its path flying upward. The sheer carnage a Black Diablos can cause makes it a difficult creature to fight, and you'll need to prepare for a long haul. Getting into a tussle with a Black Diablo is a slugfest, as you trade blows back and forth in hope of chipping away at its heavy plates of armor. While standard Diablos is cool, we all know it’s the Black Diablos that reigns supreme. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>19. Shara Ishvalda</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/19-shara-ishvalda-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the final boss of Monster Hunter: World's Iceborne expansion, Shara Ishvalda perfectly encapsulates the massive scale of the series’ best monster battles. Initially appearing to be some kind of rock monster, Shara Ishvalda’s first form boasts a rugged exterior that you slowly chip away at. But as rocks crumble off its body, Shara's real form begins to show: this is a large-scale Elder Dragon, and it acts as one of the ultimate Monster Hunter set pieces. Finger-like appendages on its wings appear more like two huge hands sprouting from its body, creating something both terrifying and majestic in form. The final confrontation with Shara Ishvalda and its strange finger-wings will forever be etched into our memories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>18. Furious Rajang</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/18-furious-rajang-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Furious Rajang, the more aggressive and powerful variant of the original Rajang, is a force to be reckoned with. Its glowing golden fur charges up with electrical energy as the fight plays out<strong>, </strong>essentially turning it Super Saiyan. Hunters have spent countless hours being tossed around the battlefield by the Furious Rajang, thanks to its high-flying acrobatic wrestling stunts that leave us as little more than lifeless corpses. Between its incredibly fast movement around the arena and its quick combos, Furious Rajang seems like a fighting game character hitting you with infinite combos. We don't have to love the Furious Rajang, but we sure do respect it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>17. Astalos</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/17-astalos-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Astalos was first seen in Monster Hunter Generations, but received quite the glow up in Monster Hunter Rise's Sunbreak expansion. This flying wyvern’s hyper-aggressive nature means near certain death for any hunter or monster silly enough to walk into its line of sight. It's sort of like that high-school bully that is always looking to fight, even if there's no actual reason to. Thanks to its flashy lightning attacks and prismatic wings, Astalos is as beautiful as it is dangerous. This means that every encounter with Astalos is an important moment because you'll need to make a quick decision to hightail it out of there, or stand and hold your ground. Just make sure you bring a weapon big enough to bonk it on the head and take it down a peg or two if you decide to fight.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>16. Amatsu</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/16-amatsu-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Dragon Amatsu is a sight to behold. Adorned with golden horns, it swims through the skies like a fish in the ocean. Its ability to control storms and wind makes Amatsu a fearsome monster to hunt; It’ll throw out massive tornadoes and gusts of wind across a rainy battlefield arena, which all make for a memorable fight. While initially introduced in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, it's in Rise’s Sunbreak expansion that Amatsu's whimsical nature truly shines, where it will hurl you through the skies and pull you in through tunnels of wind  like a surfer gliding through a tube of water towards a monster’s maw. More than anything though, Amatsu signifies great calamity, making it feared by everyone throughout the land. Its set piece moment in Sunbreak, where it swirls around darkened skies to announce itself as a true end-game level threat, helps put it above many other monsters on this list. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>15. Raging Brachydios</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/15-raging-brachydios-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's something about a big boy monster who just wants to hit stuff, and Raging Brachydios is exactly that. A giant rock monster with fire hands and a thirst for blood, Raging Brachydios will keep you on your toes by smashing the ground and erupting the slime on its body to create arena-wide explosions. The Raging variant of the Brachydios is much deadlier than the regular version thanks to a more volatile slime that coats its body, causing faster and more potent explosions. Don't worry, we find the slime kind of gross, which is why we're determined to ensure this monster doesn't live to see another day. This variant ensures you're always on the move, making it difficult to position yourself for massive damage, but once you learn the rhythm of the fight it makes for the most rewarding sense of accomplishment. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>14. Glavenus</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/14-glavenus-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">How could you not fall in love with a giant dinosaur with a massive blade for a tail? Glavenus swings its giant sharpened appendage like a broadsword, cleaving anything in its path in two. As its tail dulls, Glavenus uses its own teeth to sharpen the blade, and we can't think of anything more metal than that. Originally introduced in Monster Hunter Generations, most folks likely remember Glavenus thrashing around in Monster Hunter: World's Iceborne expansion. While Glavenus might not be as popular as Rathalos or other monsters, its unique design and brutal attack damage make it a standout monster and one we always love to fight. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>13. Teostra</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/13-teostra-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Teostra is something of a celebrity in the Monster Hunter series. Dating all the way back to 2006’s Monster Hunter 2, Teostra has appeared in a total of 17 games, expansions, and spin-offs, ranging from Freedom 2 to Rise. Teostra's command of fire makes hunting it an incredibly brutal activity. Whether it's heating up its body and producing flames so hot it can burn hunters at range or spewing fire across the battlefield, Teostra is not to be trifled with. Its supernova attack, triggered by a spark of its teeth, is enough to bring any hunter to their knees. Teostra is a classic, and one that no Monster Hunter journey is complete without. Sometimes the classics don't reinvent the wheel, but provide a strong foundation to build upon afterward. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>12. Namielle</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/12-namielle-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Namielle is an interesting Elder Dragon as it commands both water and electricity, a combo not often seen together. With its large black wings and slimy outer layer, Namielle can slide around the battlefield and cover it in water. Despite being an Elder Dragon, its moveset is closer to that of the monster Mizutsune, shooting jetstreams of water from its mouth and quickly moving about the arena. As mentioned, Namielle can also produce electricity, which it uses to shock hunters or other prey. While initially appearing a rather passive monster, Namielle is a powerhouse when provoked. Namielle's unique combination of elemental attacks provides hunters with a nice change of pace and creates a monster that feels elevated in both form and function. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>11. Gore Magala</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/11-gore-magala-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gore Magala is a complete nightmare of a creature. This six-limbed young Elder Dragon has huge, grabbing claws on its back that can shred through almost anything in reach. Born without eyes, it emits pollen-like scales that attach to prey, which allows Gore Megala to sense their target’s body heat. As it scatters more scales it will change the color of the sky and enter into a frenzy, reaching a new, heightened power level. Gore Magala is powerful on its own terms, but once it reaches adulthood it sheds its skin and becomes Shagaru Magala, a more fearsome, golden winged, adult form of its previous self. This transformation provides a level of insight into a monster’s lifecycle previously unseen in the series, which makes Gore Magala a stand out creature on this list.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Rathalos</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/10-rathalos-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rathalos, the red wyvern first seen on the cover of the original game, is the de facto Monster Hunter series mascot. Our large friend has appeared in every single entry of the Monster Hunter series, as well as making appearances in Final Fantasy 14, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and even Metal Gear Solid: Peacewalker, and so this list would not be complete without what is arguably the franchise's most iconic creature. The Rathalos is a fan-favorite and one that can often give newcomers and veterans alike a hard time in the wild. So this slot is for our beautiful baby, our cherished pal, our good buddy Rathalos. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. Fatalis</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/9-fatalis-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatalis is arguably one of the strongest monsters in the series. Originally introduced in the very first Monster Hunter, this massive black Elder Dragon is known for its ability to level entire castles on a whim. It was most recently included in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne’s final update, which made Fatalis the true final fight of the game. Its massive scale and imposing figure make it one of the most difficult fights in the series, in part thanks to its fire breath being able to ignite an entire arena and leave only destruction in its wake. Fatalis is a monster to be truly feared, and a standing reminder of what Elder Dragons are capable of. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Kirin</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/8-kirin-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Do not be fooled by Kirin's graceful form and demeanor. This unicorn-like Elder Dragon will not hesitate to impale you on its giant horn like a chicken kebab. Its quick dashes and lightning attacks will leave your head spinning. It often circles you faster than you can rotate the camera, which means you’ll need to make use of perfect positioning unless you want to have your favorite Palicos wheeling you back to camp with nothing left but your life. As Kirin leaps across the battlefield and you revel in its splendor, keep your head on a swivel and your blade sharpened. This monster is a perfect reminder that sometimes beautiful things can also be deadly. Kirin is a staple of the Monster Hunter series and one fans come to expect with each new entry. Kirin is more than just another monster, but a series icon that is adored by fans, even if it's the cause of many hunter deaths.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. Mizutsune</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/7-mizutsune-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mizutsune is a leviathan similar to Amatsu. It’s armed with pressurized water jet blasts and has the ability to slide around the arena fluidly. However, Mizutsune doesn't come packaged with Amatsu’s world ending calamity and is a little prettier to look at, so it scores a higher place on our list. Its ability to blow bubbles that hinder your movement and eventually knock you over makes this a pretty dangerous monster to get tangled up with. However, Mitzusune's movements are majestic, which makes each and every moment of the battle a spectacle, akin to watching a perfectly choreographed dance sequence centerstage. While Mizutsune might not be the most technical or complex fight on this list, it's one that reminds us that hunts can be enchanting, and getting lost in such a moment is what makes the series special. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Lagiacrus</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/6-lagiacrus-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another leviathan makes the list and with good reason. Lagiacrus, originally introduced in Monster Hunter 3, is a true menace. Diving below the water and finding this giant, long necked, dinosaur-like monster is a memory seared into the deepest parts of our brain. Having to navigate this fight underwater in your slow and bulky armor puts you at a disadvantage, and so as Lagiacrus swims circles around you, learning how to seize each opportunity to land a strike becomes a game of its own. Lagiacrus is a formidable opponent, and one we hope to meet again down in the ocean’s depths, but it's been nearly a decade since we've last seen it. Lagiacrus defines a generation of hunters and those hunters will never forget their first fight against the Monster Hunter 3's cover art beast. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Crimson Glow Valstrax</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/5-crimson-glow-valstrax-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Have you ever thought "I wish the monsters in Monster Hunter looked more like a fighter jet speeding across the sky?" Well, you're in luck. Crimson Glow Valstrax, introduced as post-launch DLC for Monster Hunter: Rise, is a variant of Vlastrax that has been given afterburners. Its glowing red wings shoot flames as it darts across the sky, making for one of the coolest introductions to a monster in the series history. Using its large sharp wings as blades, Crimson Glow Valstrax is one of the series’ most unique monster designs in recent memory. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Savage Deviljho</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/4-savage-deviljho-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Every hunter's favorite pickle boy, the original Deviljho is something of a Monster Hunter legend. Known in the early games for its relentless nature and ability to dish out absurd amounts of damage, the Deviljho rose to fame in the community rather quickly. In Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate the Savage Deviljho was born, a red variant with some new moves and a much needed facelift. Its constant rage and larger radius breath attacks make the savage version much more, well, savage. Its near-constant frenzy leads it to attack anything and everything in its sight, leaving no stone unturned in its neverending attempt to quench its bloodthirst. Savage Deviljho is proof that no matter how difficult you think a fight can be, there's always something even harder right around the corner.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Nargacuga</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/3-nargacuga-1739888257432.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nargacuga's features resemble that of a black panther… well, a black panther with wings and a giant spiked tail. It lurks in the shadows, waiting to get the drop on unsuspecting hunters. Its ferocious nature and natural ability to hunt prey makes the Nargacuga completely terrifying. Whether it's getting ambushed by one in a battle or having to go toe to toe against this vicious predator, Nargacuga makes a strong case for being one of the best monster designs in the series. Speed is one of Nargacuga's biggest strengths, so you best be prepared to stay on the move. Despite Nargacuga never really changing from game to game, it's a prime example of getting a monster right the first time, and having everyone look forward to fighting it again and again. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Nergigante</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/2-nergigante-1739888257432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nergigante is Monster Hunter World’s signature beast. This dangerous Elder Dragon is the star of one of the game’s climactic fights, a battle where you finally get to tussle against the fearsome foe depicted on the collector’s edition box art.. Nergigante is covered in spiky horns that regenerate over time, and the only way to prevent huge damage from coming your way is to stay aggressive and stop them from regenerating. Nergigante's den, covered in crystalized rock, makes for a thematically appropriate arena that only adds to this monster's mystique. Its ability to pummel you into the ground in a flash can make light work of even seasoned hunters. Between its design, arena, and theme, Nergigante stands tall among the greatest monsters of the series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Zinogre</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/1-zinogre-1739888257431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Our top dog, our best fanged wyvern. The thunder cat Zinogre takes our number one spot. Zinogre exudes a confidence unlike any other monster in the Monster Hunter universe. If Furious Rajang goes Super Saiyan when its fur glows yellow, then Zinogre goes Super Saiyan Blue. Its glorious scaled design and potent lightning attacks make Zinogre a truly fantastic monster. Thanks to storing Thunderbugs in its horns, it has the ability to supercharge itself with electric energy, which covers the arena in a light show rivaled only by a rave or late-night club excursion. Anytime this brawny wyvern commands the screen, we welcome it with open-arms, ready to lock horns with it. Zinogre is not a monster to be messed with, and one that we are always cheering for when it makes its return. Not only did Zinogre capture the hearts of fans when it debuted in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, but it captured the true spirit of the franchise. This creature is the blueprint for an excellent fight that contains fast-paced action, devastating power, and a rocking theme that worms its way into our brains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are our top 25 monsters from the Monster Hunter series. There are literally hundreds of others that didn't make the cut, but from our adventures, these are creatures that we cherished facing the most. Let us know in the comments below what your favorite monster is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse Vitelli is a freelance writer and published author.

<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015, and today, it’s still going strong. Ubisoft has made this flagship shooter the poster boy for its esports ecosystem, and the millions of fans worldwide can attest to how popular it is. From multi-million-dollar tournaments to a game that never stops evolving, Rainbow Six Siege is <strong>still </strong>in a very good place in the wider esports industry.</p>



<p>That topic was broached by Gaming World Media at the recent Six Invitational tournament in Boston. The team caught up with François-Xavier Deniele, Ubisoft’s VP of Global Esports, to talk about how Rainbow Six esports got started and why it’s still such a popular game today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-rainbow">The Power of Rainbow</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six is a legendary enough brand, but the strength of Siege is another talking point entirely. This game has stood firm for a decade, and it can be argued that in the last year or so, it has gotten <strong>increasingly popular</strong>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft refuses to relent when it comes to content updates and innovation, and most recently, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/">uncovered Siege X</a>, a full-blown overhaul that’s poised to take Rainbow Six Siege to the next level.</p>



<p>Looking back to where it all started, Deniele explained to Gaming World Media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I want to just look back ten years ago, Ubisoft was not known at all as an esports company.</p>



<p>I remember having my first meeting with orgs and clubs, being a Ubisoft guy, when you have Blizzard, Riot, Valve… And ten years after, yeah, we’re at the table and we’re proven.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But what does it take to keep Rainbow Six Siege so stable after all these years?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For me, it’s to stay open. Listen to the community all the time, make sure that we are serving the game. We are not here to <strong>change </strong>the game. The game is here for a large community. Esports needs to be delivering the best of the game and not trying to change the game.</p>



<p>It’s very important for me that we have a lot of discussions about the evolution of the game and also we make sure that we are sticking with the reality of the game, where the game is important, and not trying to think that we can become big on esports where the game is not here.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Talking about the wider ecosystem, Deniele mentioned that a constant flow of fresh talent is pivotal to the ongoing success of an esports game. There’s also a lot to be said about the structure of that competitive scene, and having breaks and supporting grassroots endeavours are remarkably important elements.</p>



<p>That’s the nature of the Six Invitational, and it was portrayed perfectly by two ‘orgless’ teams making it so far into this year’s event. While some esports games might ‘gatekeep’ who can compete in their events, Rainbow Six Siege is, for the most part, wide open and super accessible.</p>

<p>A new Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater remaster is on the way. This according to what pro skateboarder Tyshawn Jones said during a radio appearance on February 18.</p>



<p>Talking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxPaLb7i-ezl_iTk1bqEwOkJmHOXgFbMax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York’s Power 105.1 FM</a>, Jones gave away that a new game is set to be revealed and/or released in the near future.</p>



<p>“I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out so that’s cool,” he said. “They got a new one they remastering so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one.”</p>



<p>Talks surrounding the future of Tony Hawk games has been circulating for months. Back in September, Hawk himself said he was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking to Activision</a> about the future of the series.</p>



<p>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hawk said at the time. “But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p>He then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on social media</a> that he wasn’t “supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-what-is-playstation-doing-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-playstation-doing-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is PlayStation Doing? — Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>The last Tony Hawk game to release was Tony Haw’s Pro Skate 1 + 2 in 2020. The game  was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022.</p>



<p>There had been rumors of a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remaster being in development, but nothing came of those at the time. Should Jones’ claims be accurate, it would seem to point to that being the game.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment on Jones’ claims of a new Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater remaster coming soon. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>

                <p>Days Gone Remastered will be an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-preorders-are-now-live-ps4-owners-can-upgrade-for-just-10/1100-6529487/">affordable $10 upgrade</a> to anyone who owns the 2019 survival-action game, but there is a catch here. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-might-not-be-able-to-redeem-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-on-ps-plus-extra/1100-6505626/">Like several other PlayStation games</a> that have gotten the PS5 remaster treatment, the upgrade doesn't apply to the PS Plus version currently available in the Game Catalog, or the one that was given away back in April 2021 as a PS Plus freebie.</p><p>Naturally, this hasn't gone over well with fans who have taken to online forums like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fans-upset-days-gone-remastered-10-ps5-upgrade-offer-doesnt-work-if-you-only-own-the-game-via-ps-plus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) to voice their complaints. As several people have noted, PS Plus is a paid-for subscription service, and in comparison, Microsoft allows Game Pass subscribers to upgrade to premium editions of new releases, allowing them to access the benefits of their upgraded games--like early access--at an attractive price. It is worth noting that you'll still need to purchase the base game on Xbox, if you plan to keep playing without a Game Pass subscription.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVMWMJdvdRQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XVMWMJdvdRQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another point of contention brought up is that Sony still allows its users to purchase DLC for PS Plus games, and many see the "Remaster" upgrade of Days Gone as a somewhat similar piece of content that can be added onto a game. "This is as stupid as requiring someone to pay for the full game when purchasing a DLC for a PS Plus game," CoolGur878 wrote. "And, mind you, PS Plus is not a free service."</p><p>Whatever Sony's reasoning, it clearly hasn't gone over well with a vocal section of the Days Gone fandom. For everyone else interested in seeing Deacon St. John's zombie-apocalypse adventure on PS5, there are some impressive visual upgrades to look forward to when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/" data-ref-id="1100-6529467">Days Gone Remastered arrives on April 25</a>.</p><p>Increased foliage draw distance, improved shadow and lighting quality, and VRR support are some of the features being touted by developer Bend Studio, and the game will also come with new content like speedrun, permadeath, and horde modes.</p>

                <p>The PS5 is currently riding high, but everyone always wants to know what's coming next. It's been reported that the PS6 is in the works, and according to former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida, the system launching in 2028 feels "right."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida the last console cycle was about seven years long, and if that holds again, the PS6 would debut in 2027, and he said that feels "a bit too early." Stressing that he has no inside information about the PS6, Yoshida said, "If the next PlayStation comes out in 2028, that feels right to me."</p><p>He added that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-console-generation-may-start-in-2028-xbox-court-docs-say/1100-6515423/" data-ref-id="1100-6515423">next Xbox might be planned for 2028 as well</a>, based on a leak from Microsoft, but of course, this may not be true and plans can always change. In any event, Yoshida speculated that there is a chance that the next PlayStation and Xbox devices come out in the same year.</p><p>This would be in keeping with tradition, as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S debuted in not just the same year but the same month back in November 2020.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say that the PS5 generation was "slowed" due to manufacturing issues pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic and component shortages.

		<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is swinging its way to release this month on 28th February (and with a week of Early Access starting on Friday 21st), but what comes after that? 2K and HB Studios have now revealed what players can expect with the post-launch seasons of content and the Clubhouse Pass of free and premium rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA TOUR 2K25 Developer Diary #3 I Seasons &amp; Clubhouse Pass I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LqpJ9SmtIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Each season will bring free new courses, quests, challenges and a fresh track of rewards in a Clubhouse Pass. Season 2, for example, will bring The Old Course at St. Andrews Links to all players for free, for example.</p>
<p>For PGA Tour 2K25, Seasons will be tied to the five MyPlayer archteypes, with Technicians set to feature in Season 1, before the Greenskeeper, Magician, Powerhouse and Sculptor get to take the spotlight through the five planned seasons of content. Each one lends itself to a different playstyle, so it could be a bit sucky if you’re best with an archetype that’s fourth or fifth in line.</p>
<p>Each Season’s Clubhouse Pass will be aligned with real-life golf tournaments and events.

						<h5>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h5><p><span>February 21st, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Ryu ga Gotoku Studio</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><span>If there’s one thing series veterans of the Like a Dragon and Yakuza series have been begging for, it’s more Majima. This Chaotic Good ex-Tojo Lieutenant has been constantly at Kiryu’s heels and only really got his time in the limelight as the deuteragonist in Yakuza 0 and one of the four playable heroes in Yakuza: Dead Souls. For more than twenty years, the Mad Dog of Shimano has yet to take center stage in his own game and all of that is about to change in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>It’s important to note that this is most definitely a Y’s game, if the Y happened to actually stand for Yakuza. Our overly vocal protagonist finds himself shipwrecked in a foreign land and a wicked case of amnesia to book. All he needs is a big, burly sidekick that can bash his way through walls. If old Six Gun Saejima doesn’t fit that bill, I don’t know who would. Anyways, back to the amnesia. The all-important plot device that Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii hinges on as the basis of its adventure. After being accosted by a group of pirate roleplayers (while the clothes aren’t real, for some reason, the swords they carry sure are), Majima finds the concept to be incredibly fascinating and worthy of his next grand adventure. It doesn’t take long before Majima comes up with the bright idea that he needs to somehow return to Nele Island, the source of most of the previous Yakuza title’s story when not meandering around the dual cities of Honolulu and Yokohama. Majima can’t remember a thing about his actual purpose for going there initially but the pieces slowly come together along the adventure.</span></p>
<p><span>After hijacking an enemy vessel and taking some of his saviors (and the ship’s original cook) under his command, Majima soon goes all in on the pirate lifestyle, dressing the part, picking up an old blunderbuss and other pirate-y tools, and quickly picking up the mantle of Sea Dog Majima. Similar to his playstyle in Yakuza 0 and Joryu's kit in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Majima has two combat stances to bring out to the brawler melee, each with unique heat actions and taking full advantage of the weapons in his arsenal. Unique to this edition are the ability to equip up to ten rings, each working like a typical piece of armor and bestowing upon Majima stat and sometimes unique passive buffs.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The actual piracy that Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii centers around feels like a secondary minigame and I found a lot of similarities to Ichiban’s Dondoko Island from the previous game. What I found most engaging was the naval warfare that <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-naval-combat-looks-even-better-than-skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">felt like a simplified and snappier version of what Ubisoft came up with in Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. When sailing the high seas of Hawaii, Majima can fish up crafting materials and engage in the occasional random encounter or miniboss fight with a named pirate crew; besting the latter increases his pirate rank little by little and permits him to take on higher rank fights in the Coliseum in Madlantis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Naval warfare is separated into two phases: ship combat and boarding. The ship combat is a fairly straightforward action game where you and the enemy ships freely steer around a small arena and try to blast the other ship apart with cannons bolstered to either side of the ship, a front-facing machinegun, or the old standby of just ramming into the enemy vessel. While there are a few boosts you can use to give your ship a nitrous boost or repair and recover damage sustained, you’ll spend most of the time blasting at enemy vessels while trying to outmaneuver their guns and get out of the danger zones. Despite the ship combat being somewhat simplistic in nature and not truly evolving much over the short playtime, it was still a highlight for one of the best Yakuza minigames not named Dondoko Island.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>After capsizing all but the enemy leader’s vessel, the second phase of ship combat opens up with Majima leading a boarding party onto the enemy ship. This descends into an all-out brawl of the entirety of both ships until last man standing. Some of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii’s best battles are these mass battles and even with the short runtime of this year’s Gaiden title, players will look to enjoy a couple of dozen battles that used to be limited to just one or two in most mainline titles and showcase just how fun and fluid Majima and his two combat stances play.</span></p>
<p><span>Majima’s role as pirate captain on the high seas, despite its appearance as an action title, is still largely an RPG numbers game. Those crew you recruit can be assigned to various posts on the ship and either confer passive bonuses or directly increase the ship’s stats in terms of health and damage output. A much smaller 3-person squad can be assigned for special summon abilities during boarding melees while the bulk of your pirate crew can be assigned as the boarding parties themselves and take part in large scale melee brawls both on ship or on land. You’ll still have to raise their morale and either fight alongside them in enough random battles or give them gifts to raise their stats and most crew members fall into different rarities that determine their stat caps and how strong their individual abilities are. If you spend the extra few bucks on the Digital Deluxe Edition of Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii and unlock Kiryu and Ichiban as crew members, you can feasibly ignore a large chunk of the recruitment minigame and steamroll your way through most pirate encounters just by having a few top tier recruits.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>When it comes time to hit the waves in the Goromaru, sailing about can be a fairly simple and boring affair outside of the ship combat. Rather than any sort of large open world to explore, the waters are segmented into smaller maps, each with only a handful of points of interest, usually in the form of rival ship captains or small linear islands to disembark and explore for lost treasures. There’s not a lot of excitement or hidden secrets outside of these points of interest and ship battles, so expect to tune out the one sea shanty that the pirate crew sings ad nau</span><span>seam or at least put on a custom soundtrack of SEGA songs you’ve collected in Honolulu.</span></p>
<figure>

<p><span>One of the last mainline Yakuza: Like a Dragon titles brought in the largest city to date with its depiction of Honolulu and it was a given that the developers wouldn’t let it be limited to just a single game. What I didn’t quite expect was that Honolulu made up half, if not more, than the actual playtime in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. In the forty-some hours it took for me to earn the platinum trophy, I counted that I spent nearly twenty-five hours combing the streets on a Street Surfer, hitting up the Crazy Eats and Sicko Snap for some quick cash and unique loot, and trying to max out my Aloha Links so I could befriend Kei and make her part of the Majima pirate crew. Sadly, so much of Honolulu feels like it’s simply there to pad the brief runtime of Majima’s solo game and while there’s certainly a lot of diversions to see and play, players could just as easily skip over this day trip to Honolulu and just focus on the main story and still feel satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span>Marketing Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii as this grandiose swashbuckling adventure feels a little disingenuous when the actual piracy devolves down into the title’s primary minigame. All of that aside, for a Yakuza side story, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is an amusing take on the formula and putting one of the series’ most chaotic personas at the helm of a proper followup to the final moments of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.</span></p>

					<h2>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Giving Goro Majima his own game to do whatever the hell he wants and it turning into a pirate adventure on the high seas might sound like an amazing combination, but this is one boat ride that's trapped in the conventions of the Like a Dragon series and doesn't take enough risks to be a must-play standalone title.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Majima's first canon playable experience in 30 years of story
</li><li>Ship combat, while simple, is some of the most fun since Ubisoft's pirate assassin
</li><li>Massive melee fights
</li><li>Ryuji Akiyama's comedic charms shine, especially in the live action Minato Girls segments
</li><li>Some deep cuts for the playable Master System including Star Jacker and Poseidon Wars 3-D</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Being a pirate is a small footnote to the adventure and plays largely like this year's iteration of Dondoko Island
</li><li>Extremely short runtime with intentional padding to run around Honolulu or engage in bounty hunts to raise Majima's pirate rank
</li><li>Poor PS4 performance including freezing and hitching in action sequences
</li><li>Half-length adventure at full-game price
</li><li>Story spoilers for Infinite Wealth dropped from the get-go</li>						</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-could-let-you-create-an-in-game-npc-for-charity.1112145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda is holding a charity auction that could allow you to create your very own character to appear in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, with all proceeds from the auction going to the Make-a-Wish Foundation.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2KceBLysMenA9JY9LsnSL3/bid-on-a-chance-to-create-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Bethesda says the winner of the auction will get "the opportunity to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>".</p>

<p>All money made from the auction will go directly to Make-a-Wish, and the auction is open to anyone in the United States, although you'll probably want to have a fair bit of cash handy if you're planning to bid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=tEaLNbns 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=P1vxVeO9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>See that NPC in front of the Dragonborn? That could be your NPC, only in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>instead of&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>At time of writing, current bidding stands at a whopping $11,650, so you're going to have to bid over that if you want to create your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character. Still, at least everything is going to charity!</p>

<p>Of course, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>currently doesn't have a release window; in fact, we know very little about the game, beyond the fact that it's presumably still in development and that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">probably won't release until next year or later</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Bethesda doesn't provide any kind of time frame in its post, so it could be a while before you're invited to collaborate with the studio to make your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>Again, though, all of the proceeds for the bid are going to charity, so if you've got a lot of money knocking around and you're looking to spend it on a good cause, you could do a heck of a lot worse than this.</p>




<p><em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>was first announced all the way back in 2018, and since then, Bethesda has been relatively radio-silent regarding the game.</p>

<p>We still don't know where it will be set or what the story will be, nor do we know what to expect with regards to gameplay (although we can guess it'll be a first-person RPG along the lines of its predecessors).</p>

<p>If you'd like to bid on the character creation auction, you can do so by heading over to the Make-a-Wish Foundation's <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Silent Auction page</a> and searching for "Bethesda", where you'll find an opportunity to contribute. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=dfr_landing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make a flat, non-Bethesda-related donation here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/relic-reveals-b-movie-inspired-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars.1112142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-earth-vs-mars-turn-based-strategy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Company of Heroes&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>developer Relic has revealed&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>, a turn-based strategy game that looks like it's taking equal inspiration from&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars&nbsp;</em>and classic 50s sci-fi B-movies.</p>

<p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/relicgames/status/1891851631622328551" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">describes</a> the game as a "Relic Labs-style" project, which probably means it's one of the first efforts we're seeing that's part of Relic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans" rel="nofollow">intention to branch out and create smaller games</a> alongside its flagship real-time strategy titles.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a game inspired by classic sci-fi,&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>takes place during a Martian invasion, which sees Martians "abducting animals and humans and harvesting their atomic essence to create bizarre Martian-creature hybrids". Yikes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=knPx8MKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=dDSHUgn- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is set during a Martian invasion, but it's a colorful romp inspired by&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than taking the relatively serious&nbsp;<em>XCOM: Enemy Unknown&nbsp;</em>direction, Relic has chosen a more colorful&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>-style aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars.</em></p>

<p>In a slightly terrifying twist, you'll be able to create human-creature hybrids of your own to take on the Martians. Specifically, you'll be splicing animals from Earth together, as well as with humans, to "create powerful hybrid supersoldiers" to fight alongside the military. Space Marines look positively cute in comparison.</p>

<p>Relic gives examplkes like "the fast-moving cheetah-fly", "devastating human-rhino hybrids", and "deadly squirrel-cow infantry". It's a good thing this game has a cartoony art style, because this all sounds like it has the potential to be genuinely haunting.</p>

<p>As you progress through&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>' 30-plus-mission campaign, you'll gain access to new creatures and encounter new Martian enemies as well, including a "sentient organic weapon" known as the Creep, as well as "the Martians' own mutant creations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-combat.jpg?itok=JLNqI1Ke 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-combat.jpg?itok=IVS2OfI9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars&nbsp;</em>influence is really shining through here.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned campaign,&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>will also include an online multiplayer mode where you can face off against other players, plus a versus mode in which you can battle the AI and a fully-fledged map editor.</p>

<p><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is available to wishlist right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

Meaning that, instead of looking at a mammoth of a story that can take well over 30 hours at minimum, it's a far smaller slice, this time placing Goro Majima as the main character.</p><p>Despite the absurdity of its premise, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is indeed canon, the story taking place after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Majima has amnesia, however, which leads to a fresh start for a standalone tale that is progressively intertwined with the usual swings and roundabouts of a Yakuza story.</p><p>If you're wondering how much there actually is in the game, both from a main story and side activity standpoint, this guide covers how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is and what you can expect to find.</p><h2>How Long is Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii?</h2><p>Defining the length of a Yakuza or Like a Dragon is a tough endeavor due to how many side activities there usually are, as well as the usual length of the main story. <strong>For Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, you're looking at around 15 hours to tackle the main story and some side activities</strong> along the way, structured in five chapters. For reference, Yakuza games usually have around 13 or so chapters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350"></a><figcaption>Optional islands and valuable treasure await on the high seas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg"></figure><p>Now, playing one of these games by only focusing on the primary storyline would be a disservice. Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is packed with lots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-best-skills-to-unlock/2900-6255/" data-ref-id="2900-6255">skills to unlock</a> optional activities to tackle, some of which are:</p><ul><li><strong>Substories</strong>: In usual Yakuza and Like a Dragon fashion, there's an array of smaller stories to tackle. Some are introduced as you progress through the main story, while others require you to go off the beaten path to discover them. You'll either get a new mechanic, minigame, or at least a funny and endearing side story as a result.</li><li><strong>Pirates Coliseum</strong>: Commanding your own ship is a big part of the game, and the Pirates Coliseum is the perfect place to test your current crew and ship loadout. Yes, you can both upgrade and customize the ship, which will come in handy as you confront increasingly harder enemies, both in the coliseum and elsewhere while navigating.</li><li><strong>Crew building and treasure hunting</strong>: Speaking of which, recruiting crew members is a key activity. Most of them have special requests, from gathering items to reaching a specific Pirate Rank level, a reputation system of sorts. Building a good team is crucial to sailing the seas, especially if you're exploring optional islands in search of treasure, which are essentially bite-sized dungeons with a shiny chest waiting for you at the very end.</li><li><strong>Bounties</strong>: Whether you're low on cash or just looking for a challenging smackdown, there are over a dozen fights available to tackle, netting you hefty sums of money in return.</li><li><strong>Honolulu and the usual minigames</strong>: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii places a big focus on the pirate side of things, introducing a new hub called Madlantis as well as waters to navigate and explore. But this is all combined with the existing foundation of Honolulu, Hawaii that was first presented with Infinite Wealth. You get to explore the city at your own leisure and take part in familiar minigames. Most rewards are intertwined with new features like crewmembers and your pirate reputation, making for a great synergy overall.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340"></a><figcaption>Photo Rally is one of the returning activities from Infinite Wealth. As for the mascot, I promise you he's fine. I think.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg"></figure><p>As such, the answer to how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will depend entirely on what you're interested in doing and for how long. Playing on PC, I have over 26 hours logged in, but the in-game time is lower. Since I played for guides, this meant leaving the game open while I took notes and organized screenshots, for example.</p><p>I also played some minigames through completion, which added time, and there were some activities that I barely took part in, which I'm sure would have added at least another dozen hours to the overall count. Regardless of what you choose to do, the high seas of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii are yours for the taking.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze Studios has released its yearly financial report for 2024, and things are looking pretty grim for a studio that was already arguably on the ropes at the end of the previous year.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-full-year-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Starbreeze says its net sales for 2024 fell by about 70% when compared to the previous year; it raked in just 185.9 million Swedish kronor this year compared to 633.5 million last year, with both&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>games dropping well into the double digits (having achieved triple-digit sales last year).</p>

<p>Pretty much all of Starbreeze's numbers are down when compared to 2023, but it looks like the Swedish developer is trying to keep a brave face, with acting CEO Mats Juhl describing the year as "intense but in many ways also successful".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-financials-2025.jpg?itok=8EyxTLt9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-financials-2025.jpg?itok=sw762rxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>hasn't exactly been a big earner for Starbreeze this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Juhl says the year has seen Starbreeze "strengthen[ing] the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>brand through <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap" rel="nofollow">enhancements</a>" while also "making great progress" with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game Project Baxter</a>.</p>

<p>The acting CEO, who's currently in the position following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departure of former CEO Tobias Sjögren&nbsp;in March last year</a>, also says Starbreeze has been focusing on "establishing a strong foundation for [its] third-party publishing" this year.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the studio published "Lovecraftian Stone Age" base-builder&nbsp;<em>The Tribe Must Survive&nbsp;</em>this year, as well as the FPS roguelite&nbsp;<em>Roboquest&nbsp;</em>towards the tail end of 2023. We don't currently know what else is on Starbreeze's publishing slate for the future.</p>

He should be avoiding the frontline battles to focus on picking off targets. With the right settings and knowledge of his oft-forgotten mechanics, you’ll be able to keep your team safe.</p><h2 id="h81698"><a id=""></a>Disable Automatic Swing</h2><p>This tip is as vital for Spider-Man as it is for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>. By default, the wallcrawler’s Web-Swing ability will automatically choose a spot to latch onto when used. Unfortunately, this can often result in a swing that veers off-course from your intended direction. It’s strongly recommended that you go into Spider-Man’s hero settings and disable the Automatic Swing option. I can attest that it will start feeling more comfortable and easier to control once you get used to it. Another benefit is that you can start aiming at the ground and Web-Swing will act more like a grapple hook.</p><h2 id="h81699"><a id=""></a>Use his hidden overhead smash melee</h2><p>There is a good chance that you’ve used an overhead hammerblow attack while smacking enemies around with his Spider-Power melee. It inflicts 50 damage, which is double the amount that his Spider-Power punches do, and is a great way to finish off a target. There isn’t any real mention of how to trigger this handy technique, but a couple of minutes in the practice range confirmed that it can be activated in the air after the following situations:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>After a Web-Swing</li><li>After a double jump</li><li>After jumping off of a wall</li></ul><h2 id="h81700"><a id=""></a>Swing in, get an elimination, swing out</h2><p>On paper, Spider-Man’s damage is not something I would describe as amazing. His smaller health pool and lack of self-sustainability also mean that drawn-out fights aren’t quite his forte. Your primary strategy will be to swing in to harass the opposing team and attempt to get eliminations, with support heroes being the primary targets.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Damage Heroes, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>Once you’ve taken out one or two opponents, swing back to safety and get healing from health packs or your team’s healers. Although Spidey’s Web-Swing has three uses and recharges every six seconds, I still recommend saving at least one for your eventual escape.</p><h2 id="h81701"><a id=""></a><strong>Combo your enemies with Spider-Tracers</strong></h2><p>Understanding how to dive with Spider-Man is crucial, but just as important is knowing how to inflict major damage. The trick is to use his Spider-Tracer mechanic to generate burst damage. His secondary fire, the ranged Cyber-Web Cluster, deals 30 damage and attaches a Spider-Tracer to the enemy. Spider-Tracers only last for three seconds, but they’ll deal an additional 45 damage if you manage to follow up with his Spider-Power melee or Amazing Combo ability. The Get Over Here! ability will also change from reeling an enemy to launching Spider-Man toward them with a flying kick.</p><p>An example of the easiest and most basic Spider-Man combo is the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Web Cluster &gt; Get Over Here! &gt; Amazing Combo</li></ul><p>You’ll want to modify this combo further depending on the situation. The typical methods to extend it are to add more Web Clusters or use the overhead smash melee. Just remember that Spider-Tracers won’t stack, although you can land a second one after triggering the first.</p><h2 id="h81702"><a id=""></a><strong>Coordinate with your team when using his Ultimate</strong></h2><p>Spectacular Spin is an amazing ultimate move. Not only does it dish out a decent amount of damage over a sizable range, but it also slows enemies down and can potentially stun them if they take too many hits. The extra 250 bonus health that Spider-Man receives is the cherry on top of a move that can change the momentum of a game.</p><p>Just don’t mistake its usefulness as proof that you can throw it out whenever. The damage can be outhealed by most support characters if they’re quick enough to respond. It’s also possible to get stunned out of this ultimate, which means that extra health will only help you so much. Your chances of getting some eliminations and escaping with health to spare are much better if you coordinate with your team. Pop this ult during a team push or at least when a support hero can cover you with some healing.</p><figure id="" data-id="68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-recommend-id="image://68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1672" data-height="941" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider-Man runs sidewalls on a wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spider-Man runs sidewalls on a wall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-recommend-id="image://68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1672" data-height="941" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider-Man runs sidewalls on a wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h81703"><a id=""></a>Remember Your Wall Crawl Ability</h2><p>Just like the Hulk and his ability to cling to walls, it feels like most players forget that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can. Press the jump button when near a wall to enter a crawling state. Pressing the primary attack button afterward will transition into a run. It might look a little goofy, but this is a handy ability that your enemies might not be expecting. I’ve had a lot of success with the move, whether I use it to escape a fight or latch onto a wall after an enemy Jeff tried to eject me off a ledge.</p><hr><p>As long as you make full use of Spider-Man’s kit in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and don’t save his ultimate to attempt an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace kill</a></span>, you should be fine. Diving in to pick off just one or two targets at a time does feel strange compared to any other game with the sarcastic webslinger, but it’s a role he excels at and one your team will be thankful for.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
