The jumbo-sized macro pad has 32 customizable LCD keys for controlling various functions on a Windows PC or Mac. It’s a staple among enthusiast and high-level Twitch streamers, but its customizability makes it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23700541/stream-deck-hacks-uses">incredibly handy for all sorts of desktop and laptop users</a>.</p><p>Want a button for quickly muting yourself on a Zoom call or to promptly summon Spotify? No problem. How about a series of buttons for controlling audio functions or emotes in your favorite game? With 32 keys, you have enough for a whole bunch of helpful tools at your disposal, or you can fill some with silly and superfluous things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23706779/stream-deck-pop-bubbles-bubbledeck">popping fake bubble wrap</a>. (We’re certainly not going to judge!)</p><p>While the newer $100 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24132766/elgato-neo-family-devices-stream-deck">Stream Deck Neo</a> with eight keys and capacitive page-scrolling buttons may be a more logical choice for most, there’s something about the Stream Deck XL’s massive four-by-eight lineup of keys that seems impressively cool on a desk.</p><div><p>The Stream Deck XL is the 32-key version of the Elgato Stream Deck. It doesn’t feature a swappable faceplate like the MK. 2 version of the standard Stream Deck, but it has more than double the number of buttons to push.</p></div><p><h3>Fewer buttons but more deals:</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <strong>third-gen Google Nest Learning Thermostat</strong> is on sale at <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dlearning%2Dthermostat%2D3rd%2Dgeneration&amp;afftrack=vergeroundupdeals062524">Wellbots</a> for $164 ($85 off) through July 15th when you use code <strong>VERGE85</strong> at checkout. Google’s flagship thermostat may be a little long in the tooth, but it remains a great option for a smart home gadget designed to save you money on your heating and cooling bills. The third-gen model allows you to closely monitor your energy consumption from your phone, and it’s designed to learn your routines to keep you comfortable when you’re home and not waste energy cooling or heating an empty house when you’re away.</li><li><strong>LG’s 65-inch C3 OLED TV</strong> is $1,377.99 (about $217 off) at <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergeroundupdeals062524&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-lg-c3-series-oled-evo-4k-tv-2023z-16">Woot</a>. That price is also about $119 better than the C3’s typical discounted price in this size. The C3 is last year’s midrange OLED from LG, but it remains an excellent option for watching movies, TV shows, or playing games. It’s got excellent color contrast with HDR, and in addition to those deep, inky blacks on most OLEDs, it also supports up to 120Hz on each of its four HDMI 2.1 ports. This model also added some nifty menu settings to guide you step by step on customizing the color exactly to your taste.</li><li>The <strong>SteelSeries Arena 9</strong> surround sound desktop computer speakers are selling for $439.99 ($110 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KNWMGKF/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. The 5.1 speaker setup has some boomy bass thanks to its 6.5-inch subwoofer, and its RGB lighting can match the colors of the game you’re playing thanks to SteelSeries’ software.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC yet hovers at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">Mixed</a> in the blood-encrusted annals of the Steam user review consensus. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">wrote earlier in the week</a>, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.</p>
<p>As publishers Bandai Namco have <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043">sweetly observed</a>, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.</p><!--more-->
<p>Here to save the day and reconcile the warring parties are the modders and in particular, Sereenaty, whose <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5263?tab=description">Normalized DLC damage</a> mod (thanks, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/elden-ring-mod-remove-shadow-of-erdtree-scadutree-system">VG247</a>) adjusts damage dealt and received within the DLC areas to be more in line with the base game, theoretically doing away with the need for Scadutree Fragments. As the modder sums up, "if you're tired of having your entire build thrown in the Trash just because you're not into collectibles, this mod is for you". The mod also swaps out the bulk of the game's Scadutree Fragments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-great-runes-divine-towers">Rune Arcs</a>, though you'll apparently still receive a few Fragments from enemy drops.</p>
<p>My schadenfreude about the internet's git-gudders being hoisted by their own quote-dunks aside, I don't have a magic disappearing goat in this particular Elden horse race. I haven't played Shadow Of The Erdtree yet, partly because a lot of people at the Treehouse are already playing it and partly because I'm more interested these days in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lxd-red-honey-is-an-astonishingly-good-free-metroidvania-that-owes-something-to-psychedelic-bees">psychedelic bee products</a>. Still, I'm interested in the angle that searching for Fragments in Erdtree is a chore you must undertake if you want to make headway, and how that differs from the experience of levelling a character by gathering runes. If you're playing, I'm keen to know whether you feel like you're being forced to search for them, or whether discovering them is coming about as part of routine exploration, which is the major thrill of any From Software game for me.</p>
<p>People who don't want to mod Erdtree and also don't want to be speared and barbecued by any given foe should definitely check out our guides section. Ollie, Kiera and Jeremy have put together <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragment-locations">a list of all 50 Scadutree Fragments and their locations</a>. They also strongly recommend that you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order">fight Erdtree's bosses in this order</a>. Forget modders - guides writers are the true champions of the realm. They git gud only to ensure that we might git gud in turn.</p>

BioWare has been focusing a lot of its marketing push for the sequel on the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">party of seven heroes</a></span>, each of whom embodies a different faction within the universe and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">will be a romance option</a></span>. But where will these new characters fall in the pantheon of the series? <em>Dragon Age</em>’s companions are arguably the most well-regarded thing about the franchise, as is pretty standard for BioWare games. It’s got us thinking, who are the best characters in each <em>Dragon Age </em>game? Rather than creating an unwieldy list of 30+ characters spanning the entire series thus far, we decided to break them up between games. Here’s our ranking of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>party members and advisors, from worst to best.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It is incredibly fitting that Cole, the spirit of compassion who can join the Inquisition, has the ability to make people forget about him, because that dude is unfortunately a pretty forgettable guy. Cole is by no means a bad character, but his story doesn’t quite live up to the highs of his peers. Cole’s existence as something in between a spirit and a human, and how he chooses to lean into one path or the other, creates some interesting routes for the character, but it ultimately hits with the same fervor as a fairly forgettable side quest. He’s good! He’s just unremarkable against the competition.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Josephine Montilyet is the only advisor in <em>Inquisition </em>who fans didn’t have an established relationship with prior to the 2014 RPG, and she still managed to carve out her place in their hearts. As the Inquisition’s resident diplomat, Josie is always thinking practically where Cullen might send soldiers to handle a problem and Leliana would cut its throat. As her story unfolds, it’s revealed that the most buttoned-up character in Skyhold has a bit of a wild side, but is still a fan of the finer things in life, like theater and team base gossip. Despite her political expertise, Josie is one of the most grounded, charismatic characters in <em>Inquisition</em>. Her story isn’t about some massive faction or world-shattering event, it’s about a girl who is trying to make sense of a world where dragons roam and people can shoot fire from their hands.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sera, the elven rogue and Friend of Red Jenny, is an acquired taste. She’s impulsive, disruptive, and judgemental, but she is a product of the world she’s been raised in. As a city elf, Sera has seen the worst of how Thedas treats elves and anyone who isn’t seen as part of the upper class. She’s rebellious and pursues her idea of justice with reckless abandon. That means she’s also a source of tension and drama as she butts heads with anyone who doesn’t fit her idea of what elves should be. Sera is thorny but that’s what makes her delightful when you get closer to her, letting you look past the manic angst and see someone who wants things to be better.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-recommend-id="image://ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-recommend-id="image://ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As one of the few characters to appear in every <em>Dragon Age</em> game, Cullen’s role as one of the three advisors in <em>Inquisition</em> is the culmination of every story we’ve seen him pass through. This is a man who started out dedicated to the church and his calling as a mage-fighting Templar just to watch it fail him and others time and time again. Like several other characters in <em>Inquisition</em>, Cullen reckons with who he is after the systems he bought into have fallen apart. Depending on the player’s actions, he can grow from all he’s endured in <em>Origins </em>and <em>Dragon Age II</em>, or he can succumb to the rot the church put inside him. He’s an effective symbol for the failing systems of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and an excellent reminder that its people and the world they live in are not beyond saving.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-recommend-id="image://8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-recommend-id="image://8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At this point, Varric has become a face for the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, if not <em>the </em>face after appearing prominently in three games. I have a lot of love for the dwarven storyteller, but I think my appreciation for his story in <em>Inquisition </em>has only grown stronger after seeing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-varric-bianca-solas-1851533383&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-varric-bianca-solas-1851533383">some of the payoff in <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>. Varric has gone from a simple roguish businessman in Kirkwall to a storyteller recanting some of the biggest moments in history to anyone who will listen. He has become so world-weary by the time of <em>Inquisition </em>but he’s never lost hope. His personal questline isn’t world-shattering, but it’s a reminder that this man has been dragged through unprecedented times, and will continue to be so as we head into <em>The Veilguard </em>this fall. He deserves rest. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602">I hope he gets it</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-recommend-id="image://bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leliana talks to the Inquisitor.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The return of Leliana, a companion in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, as an advisor in <em>Inquisition</em> was (and remains) controversial given that her appearance seemingly overwrote decisions the player made in the first game. Some of this was explained retroactively through epilogues, but those did little to alleviate feelings of the spymaster being one of BioWare’s seemingly unkillable favorites. Though she serves as a case study in <em>Dragon Age</em>’s complicated relationship with continuity, Leliana’s story in <em>Inquisition</em>, much like Cullen’s, shows one of the few mainstays of each <em>Dragon Age </em>game finally becoming who they were always meant to be. After saving the world once, Leliana has gone from the once soft-spoken bard to a cunning agent of the Inquisition. She is disenfranchised from the church, but not the people she served alongside. She has the potential to become the leader of the church within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe, and depending on whether you push her to remain compassionate or steel herself, her reign can be paved with kindness or blood. <em>Inquisition </em>is all about watching the world change and seeing the people who make it happen become who they’re supposed to be, and despite the series-wide complications, Leliana shines once more in her third appearance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There have been a lot of Qunari throughout the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but none have made an impression quite like Iron Bull. The mercenary is a double agent, but he’s refreshingly upfront about it when you meet him. He’s a fun-loving warrior who likes to drink, kill dragons, bro about with his team, and fuck. But despite his seemingly one-track mind, Iron Bull is one of the only characters who can actually betray you if you give him a reason to. Depending on your choices in the main game, Iron Bull may turn on you during the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC with seemingly no remorse; even if you’ve entered a romantic relationship with him. The Qunari spy told you who he was, and he will still be that by the end if you don’t give him a reason to be anyone else. You can’t judge a book by its cover, even if the title on the spine tells you everything you need to know.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Blackwall, or a man going by that name, is one of the most slept-on characters in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. He is initially believed to be a Grey Warden sent to find people to join their Darkspawn-killing ranks. It turns out, however, that he’s not a Warden at all, but a man named Thom Rainer who took on the name after the true Warden Blackwall recruited and was then killed protecting him. Rainer, believing his life otherwise forfeit, assumed Blackwall’s identity and strove to continue his work as a Warden. But in taking another man’s identity, he sought to erase his own, including his past crimes and treachery. As the guilt of his past failings catches up to him, Blackwall’s story can go multiple ways. He can accept his punishment, be given to the Wardens, or be given freedom to atone without hiding. A lot of those big reveals have gone unnoticed by fans because they’re buried under a story that feels like that of a pretty standard, overly stoic fantasy RPG warrior. Once all is said and done, though, Blackwall’s story is a pretty damn effective tale of owning up to one’s mistakes, and proudly being better.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-recommend-id="image://ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-recommend-id="image://ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame that Vivienne, one of the only mages who isn’t opposed to the Circle of Magi, the mage prison masquerading as a school in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, wasn’t in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, the game that had the war between mages and their Templar keepers at the center of its story. As much as I disagree with Vivienne’s beliefs on a fundamental level, I can’t help but be drawn in by the nuance. Vivienne is a mage who fully admits that she and people like her are dangerous, and a system like the Circle could probably alleviate everyone’s problems, but not in its current form. Whereas <em>Dragon Age II</em> paints mages as an oppressed class of people (while also simultaneously believing that they are inevitably going to become threats to society no matter what you do), Vivienne’s view of the situation is far more complex, and it makes you wonder if the catastrophic events of <em>Dragon Age II</em> might have gone very differently if only someone like her had been in Kirkwall. As a person who plays a mage in all of these games, hearing her condescend to me when I say mages should be free still feels like a particularly bad case of tinnitus, but she at least is talking more sensibly about the situation than anyone else in the room, all while having to shoulder her own personal burdens. <em>Dragon Age</em>’s inability to sit with that nuance has been the undoing of a lot of its world-building. It needed a character like Vivienne two games ago.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Religious upheaval is a central theme of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and no companion embodies that more than Cassandra. She’s the first character the Inquisitor gets in their party, and she is immediately suspicious of you. As far as she can tell, you are a symbol of everything she knows of the world changing. If you’re unwilling to play along with her worldview, any potential friendship between the two of you can sour almost immediately. How is she supposed to support the Inquisition when the person at its center is a heretic? Her reckoning only unravels further as she learns that the organization she has followed for most of her life has been corrupt, oppressing mages in ways deemed inhumane by even <em>Dragon Age </em>standards. Cassandra is one of the most devout people we’ve met in a series full of radicals, and yet while she struggles with the truths laid before her, she doesn’t shy away from them in the end. It would be so easy for a weaker person to retreat, deny the truth, and become stagnant. Cassandra watches the world change and decides to change with it.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-recommend-id="image://7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-recommend-id="image://7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, Solas is one of the less remarkable characters in <em>Inquisition</em>’s roster. He’s characterized by his knowledge of Fade-related magic, has some cool hat tricks to show you in his early conversations, and altogether seems a bit smug and judgy. Things start to change, though, as he reveals he is the source of Big Bad Corypheus’ magic. He shows frustration with the ways of the modern world, his personal quests solidify and reinforce his anger at how flippantly people view spirits, and when all is said and done, he leaves the Inquisition without a word. Then it’s revealed why Solas feels like a person out of time: He is the Dread Wolf, an elven trickster god having awoken to find himself written in history as a traitor to his people. Solas reveals in <em>Trespasser </em>that he barely viewed his friends in the Inquisition as people, and was using them to further his plan to tear down the Veil that separates the real world from the spirit one and bring back the elves’ long-lost immortality. That all changed as he grew to care for the friends he made along the way, but his mission can’t bend to newfound sentimentality. Underneath Solas’ pompous exterior is a man ravaged by guilt for what he did several millennia ago. Should he succeed in tearing down the Veil he created, that guilt will be replaced with a new one as he watches the world burn to correct his mistake. We’ll see what happens in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but <em>Inquisition </em>sets him up as the most compelling antagonist the series has ever put forth.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-recommend-id="image://d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-recommend-id="image://d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Throughout <em>Dragon Age</em>, the land of the Tevinter Imperium has been almost exclusively framed as a culturally homogenous, villainous place where mages rule without opposition, slavery is commonplace, and unspeakable evils made it the origin point of one of the Blight, one of the most ruinous phenomenon in the universe. Most of our frame of reference is from characters who were suffering at the ground level, at least until Dorian Pavus struts into view in <em>Inquisition</em>. By all accounts, Dorian should be thrilled with his setup in Tevinter. He’s the son of a powerful family, has been given every resource to nurture his magical talents, and is pretty much guaranteed a spot at the top of the country’s politics. But he is also his own man, and does not wish to cave to the life his family envisions for him. That includes standing proud as a gay man unwilling to continue his family’s bloodline, even as he is threatened with a magical take on conversion therapy at the hands of his own father.</p><p>Dorian escapes his home in Tevinter and is clearly jaded by the time he meets the Inquisitor. But as he watches the world change before him, how can he view his home country that, despite everything, he still loves? The <em>Dragon Age </em>series has often fallen into cynical cycles of scorching the earth, as if it can’t conceive of a better option. Dorian Pavus has been put through hell and back in Tevinter. He could have easily been a cautionary tale for how his home country is just as terrible as everyone in the series has ever told us. But instead, he’s a shining beacon proclaiming that it doesn’t have to be this way. Whether or not Dorian shows up in <em>The Veilguard</em>, which takes place partially in Tevinter, remains to be seen, but in <em>Inquistion</em>, he is radical hope personified. He is living, breathing proof that history is defined by those who believe that a better world is possible.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Walking into a Walmart or Target and seeing the game section made up almost exclusively of download codes makes my gamer spirit cry out in anguish. By the same token, any time a physical edition of a new game or an old classic gets announced I get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside again. Limited Run Games recently held a showcase that announced a bunch of physical editions for all types of games, including the tragically ill-fated, one-of-a-kind PlayStation 1 sequel: <em>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</em>.<br></p><p>During a 30 minute presentation, the Embracer-owned boutique distribution label Limited Run Games announced 26 upcoming releases it will be manufacturing discs and cartridges for, including some that were remastered  using its own proprietary Carbon Engine for layering retro emulation. I have no idea if works well or not, but I hope it means they got the love, attention, and respect they deserved. </p><p>There wasn’t a whole lot of information on pricing or release dates for some of the physical editions, but it’s still a nice heads-up. Now anyone who wants a physical copy can hold out for when those become available instead of double-dipping with the digital version too. After all, fans have waited decades for some of these games. What’s a few more months (or god forbid, years). </p><p>  <em>Tomba! 2</em> was the highlight, for sure. Joining Limited Run’s previously announced physical edition for the first <em>Tomba!</em>, the sequel brought the colorful PS1 platformer into a hybrid world of linear paths and 3D environments. It was a bold experiment that left the team behind it, Whoopee Camp, shuttered following its lackluster sales, though creator Tokuro Fujiwara recently directed the 2021 nostalgia trip <em>Ghosts ‘n Goblins Resurrection </em>and has provided his blessing to <em>Tomba!</em>’s return. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2b96df6601906d4702a45f73a7131a5" data-recommend-id="image://b2b96df6601906d4702a45f73a7131a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Penny rides a yo-yo in Penny's Big Breakaway.

When will these updates come? "[Solo mode] will be improved once we improve this feature," head of community and global brand director Almir Listo said in a developer update <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r26hIijRoRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You will still be required to start the game while online in Solo Mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature.</p></div><p>"It's not our full vision for this feature," he began. "For now, we're setting it as a beta to see how it runs. We expect the performance to be affected since the parts normally frontloaded by our servers will now have to be run on your own hardware.</p><p>"It will work though, and you can get progression that will update you once you return online. You will still be required to start the game while online in Solo Mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature.

"We are so sorry that the infrastructure didn't hold up as expected, and although it's impossible to prepare for every scenario — we should be able to do better," he said (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starbreeze-ceo-out-after-payday-3-disaster">but has now left the company</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-dev-apologises-for-lack-of-communication-as-mid-october-first-patch-still-a-no-show">Almost a month after its launch and Starbreeze apologised again</a> for its lack of communication, and then just a week later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-dev-apologises-for-radio-silence-explains-mia-first-patch">said sorry one more time for not delivering a promised patch</a> and again going quiet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/supervive-nee-project-loki-first-preview-a-bold-new-battle-royale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>From the outside looking in, Supervive looks like many a top-down, twin-stick style shooter you may see on any given digital game store. It only takes a couple minutes after dropping into its massive battle royale-style map to see that it does more than just look like a beautifully modeled and animated computer action game you’ve might be familiar with, but it combines elements of many games from many genres to create a battle royale that is wholly unique, with a surprising amount to learn and do in each session outside of surviving against other teams. Clashes against enemies are frantic thanks to the big emphasis on fast and varied styles of movement and cleverly designed characters with abilities that interact with each other and their surroundings in far more interesting ways than just dealing damage.</p><p>These so-called Hunters are really the first place where I was particularly wowed by Supervive. Of the 14 that were available to me, all had completely different gameplans for success in battle than each other. Some characters were pretty obviously weird out of the gate, like this black hole-slinging crowd controller, but even ones that would be relatively straightforward in any other game had a feature that made them really pop. Huntress, for example, is the bow-wielder, meaning she has attacks you’d expect from this archetype – like being able to shoot a big arrow at longer range or a fan of arrows in a zone in front of you. But she can also move through walls like an X-Man, making her far more elusive than you might expect for a character that has to take extra time to aim relatively slow shots.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Supervive - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Support or utility-focused hunters are highly effective during combat in active ways. Pushing enemies around with a rapidly expanding wall or dashing to fallen comrades to rescue them from execution are just some of the small ways Supervive refreshes a role that is usually more passive. In fact, no matter who you choose, be it a spry ranged shooter or a front-line face-puncher, you’ll have some sort of movement and displacement ability, meaning you can always reposition to avoid enemy attacks or directly disrupt opponents. Seamless movement around the map and into, out of, and through combat mixed with the many ways you can abruptly move your foes out of position, into walls, or even one another, makes this game play so noticeably different than other tactical games like League of Legends or Battlerite that it takes plenty of inspiration from. You can be elusive and aggressive all in the same motion, which feels more like fighting game shenanigans than would be typical in a shooter like this. Most characters don’t have to wait for the right opening, they can make one themselves.</p><p>Before you even get to open combat with enemies, you’ll likely have to find them first. Supervive’s huge map is dense with regions that are hiding treasures within them. In the sessions I had, after choosing a location on the map and dropping, there was always a small recon period where we had to check our surroundings for opportunities to get loot or experience. Our first few encounters were usually with groups of NPC monsters that either roamed around locations or were camped out around corners waiting for unsuspecting players. Rarely were these monsters more than a nuisance on their own, but higher-level bosses can test your team's power, and any mob camp that gets wedged between a fight between enemy teams can often be a consequential factor in them.  The map has a day and night cycle that makes monsters appear more frequently at night and levels them up in the morning, making longer games that much more dangerous in theory. In practice, they were rarely more than just ways to keep above the loot and level curve without killing other players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When you aren’t trouncing the local wildlife, you can also find some important points of interest on the map that can be super valuable. Bonfires are early game hubs that allow you to repair your shields and upgrade items. When wandering the map, you can also return to them with the press of a button to regroup. Vaults were often a top priority too, as they held top-tier gear, so long as you could survive the test they’d spring on you to unlock them. Passive gear can be a bit confusing without putting a lot of reps into Supervive to figure out the best stat combos for your character (or getting advice from developers like I did). Active gear can come in many forms like building walls that only your squad can shoot through, summoning critters to do your bidding, or creating a giant cannon that rolls out giant cats whose purpose is yet to be determined. I really liked finding a new item and obsessing over it through the course of a match, but that's another thing that's hard to optimize without many matches under your belt.</p><p>The map itself, besides being filled with a smattering of different environments like desert sands, dilapidated ruins, and snowy hills, is broken up into islands separated by gorges that will lead to your death should you fall down them. When exploring, they’re a cinch to navigate thanks to a glider with a generous float time. A simple double jump feels like an Evel Knievel stunt when enemies are around, as one touch from them will send you crashing out of the air and into oblivion. When you’re downed on solid ground, you’re turned into a wisp as you await either revival or a more concrete death, and though you can’t be harmed by enemy attacks, you can be shoved around, making you an easy target for being kicked off of ledges. Lots of fights either start as one team attempts to strategically fly onto a landmass while another hogs the edges to keep them away, and many fights end with one team attempting to shove another into the void. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A simple double jump feels like an Evel Knievel stunt when enemies are around, as one touch from them will send you crashing out of the air and into oblivion. </p></div><p>This, mixed with the maps being littered with walls and multi-level plateaus meant that simply strafing around one another in a  pitched battle on even ground was more rare than pushing each other into obstacles and using them as tactical opportunities to pick each other off. It was very uncommon to see two or more teams tussle without any members of each side getting picked off. Getting killed was a pretty common occurrence, but there are so many ways to get revived that I never felt like I was condemned to twiddle my thumbs and watch the rest of the game for very long. This always meant that if you left even a single member of a team standing, that they were a team-reviving beacon or Most Wanted Takedown away from putting their whole team back on the map and evening the odds. For me, a person who is generally pretty average at battle royales, this was a great and forgiving way to give me as many chances as possible to redeem myself.</p><p>I had tons of fun with my hands-on time, but I couldn’t stop a question from nagging me in the background of all the chaos: is yet another live service game dead on arrival, regardless of how good it is? I asked CEO Joe Tung if the wild mood swings of the games industry is an existential threat to Theorycraft’s ambitions with Supervive. “It is absolutely an existential fear,” he replied. “And I think if anyone answers that they aren’t afraid of that, they must have a reality distortion field I don’t have.” He admits that this is a difficult time to release a game, especially in a free-to-play, games as a service business model that is becoming more and more crowded by the quarter. But in the face of lots of hard to predict externalities that they can’t control, Joe feels that Theroycraft has positioned themselves from day one to weather as many storms as the world throws at them. He credits the timing in which they raised money - late 2020-through 2021 when investors were more willing to spend of prospects - and committing to a fully remote team as a way to court the best talent he could find as part of the strategy that gives them a lot of extra runway to make sure they land this plane, even if it’s not a runaway success immediately.</p><p>With only an hour or so of rounds under my belt, I still have a lot to learn about Supervive. It’s a battle royale full of ideas, and some of the inspirations are pretty easy to identify - many games like it have big maps with hotspots worth fighting over for high level loot. But when it innovates on its own, like with its roster of dynamic and expressive characters, and lots of tactical options presented by its exciting movement system and roster of active and passive items, there’s no game quite like it. If you’re an Apex Legends fan who loves the unique flavor individual characters bring to a standard FPS, an Overwatch fan who loves objective-heavy team play, or a League of Legends fan who values tactics in their team-based skirmishing, you might want to spend some time with Supervive’s first big open playtest, running now until July 7th. You might be as surprised as I was to find so many core concepts of seeminging unalike games meld so well in one colorful package.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Look for it to arrive on September 24.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2024/02/21/everything-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">first revealed</a> during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.</p>

<p>For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The full game&nbsp;Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</li>
	<li>A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue</li>
	<li>An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain</li>
	<li>A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign</li>

<p>If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/disney_epic_mickey/b/wii/archive/2010/11/29/review.aspx">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The Ubisoft of the early 2000s was a very different beast to the company that we know today. Before the open world sprawls of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry, it was Rayman, Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia that were the company’s cornerstone releases. And then there was Beyond Good &amp; Evil. A critical darling that struggled commercially, it built up a committed fanbase that elevated the game to a cult level. The 2011 remaster for PS3 and Xbox 360 performed much better, such that both the 2008 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/12/beyond-good-evil-2-returns-as-a-prequel-adventure/">2017 sequel announcements</a> sparked momentary optimism, but the long stretches of silence have turned Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2’s development into a meme and the series has felt doomed to become a relic of the past. Still, a 20th anniversary is as good a reason as any to dust off an old classic and revisit the good old days.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaU4tMuvvdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Returning to the world of Hillys inevitable involves a huge amount of nostalgia for me, so wrapped up is this game in my memories of venturing out into the world after graduating from university. Lifting the rose tinted specs to appreciate the game in a wider context, it’s clear that Ubisoft has kept the remaster pretty restrained, while making some necessary quality of life improvements to aid a modern audience and adding a few extras and bonuses for the longtime fans.</p>


<p>Assuming you are not familiar with the game already, BG&amp;E tells the story of a young reporter, Jade, and her attempts to unravel the mysteries and conspiracies behind a sinister alien invasion of her adopted home planet. This planet is populated by a mixture of species from standard homo sapiens to humanoid sharks. Jade herself lives on a lighthouse island and acts as a foster mother of sorts to a group of orphaned children alongside her Uncle Pey’j, who just happens to be a boar. When Jade’s home is threatened and attacked by aliens, she is caught up in an adventure that traverses the land eventually takes her to the moon.</p>


<p>BG&amp;E was always a game that benefited from its striking visual design rather than extreme graphical fidelity. I was worried that the remaster would lose this aesthetic and go for a more heavy-handed approach, but fortunately it has retained the feel and style of the game and produced an update that looks like my memories of the game, rather than the somewhat more jagged reality of 2003. Similarly, the soundtrack has been refreshed and rerecorded by a live orchestra, but not changed. The result is stunning and I’ll be adding it to my gaming playlist.</p>
<p>In terms of genre, BG&amp;E takes inspiration from action adventures such as classic Zelda and incorporates vehicle traversal and stealth sections into the mix. It feels like a game that predicts the open world sprawl of so many contemporary titles, but reins in the scale to still feel intimate and meaningful. The map is relatively small, but it’s packed with secrets and hidden areas that really reward exploration for completionists.</p>

<p>The controls have been remapped to be more in keeping with modern titles and I found them to be smooth and responsive on PS5. Perhaps the most important improvement is the introduction of an invert option for all game modes, solving one of the biggest complaints the original game faced. The fantastic ring-based keyboard is retained and still feels head and shoulders above all other methods of text entry on controller.</p>
<p>Dating from the golden age of single player adventures, BG&amp;E contains no multiplayer, no online components, and no DLC or microtransactions – all aspects that doubtless feed into my nostalgia for it and its era. That isn’t to say that the 20th anniversary version is barebones though, as there is a wealth of behind the scenes content for fans to look through and enjoy. Seeing the changes the game underwent through development is a real bonus for fans and the connections to the long-delayed sequel can perhaps be better understood this way.</p>

<p>Playing through the game now also benefits from the inclusion of auto-saves to avoid frustration at some of the more awkward stealth sections – perhaps the one part of the game that has not aged well. At the other end of the spectrum, truly committed players can try out the speedrun mode that completely disables saves and turns the game into a permadeath challenge. There are also the expected range of achievements that reward exploration and completionists. Most of these are fairly standard, but the ones for finishing a speedrun and for beating the final boss without losing health promise to be major obstacles for those wanting a complete set.</p>
<p>Perhaps most exciting of all, however, is a new treasure hunt questline that seeks to bridge the gap between this game and the characters and setting of the sequel. This is probably the clearest indication that that game is still in development somewhere within Ubisoft, with a touching tribute to its Creative Director, Emile Morel, being included here too.</p>

		Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary really is the best way to play this classic cult title, bringing it up to date in terms of controls, resolutions and more. The underlying game may show its age at times, especially during the enforced stealth sections, but there is so much charm and character here that it deserves a whole new audience.	</p></div>

<p>As <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/lara-croft-in-dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> says, Lara is "among gaming's most formidable - and honorable - heroes", and she's also apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bafta-poll-most-iconic-gaming-character">the most iconic gaming character of all time</a>, so her introduction to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>does make some sense, although&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>&nbsp;isn't much of a horror franchise.</p>
<p>There's no corresponding killer for Lara, so don't expect Jacqueline Natla or Himiko to show up and give her a hard time. That said, she does arrive with three perks to help her stand out from the survivor crowd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover-jumping-window.jpg?itok=N2EwvaJz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover-jumping-window.jpg?itok=JdBIh9uU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lara Croft has officially joined the cast of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Lara's first perk, Finesse, gives her 20% faster vaults while she's healthy, while her second, Hardened, reveals the Killer's aura for a few seconds instead of Lara screaming. It's activated after unlocking a chest and either cleansing or blessing a totem.</p>
<p>Finally, the Specialist perk gives Lara one token every time she opens or rummages through a chest, up to a maximum of three. When performing a great skill check on generators, the maximum required generator progress is reduced according to the number of tokens Lara's amassed.</p>
<p>Lara Croft is just one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">many characters</a> arriving in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as part of its apparent ongoing mission to become the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>of horror games.

For Blokus, a game that has players arranging <em>Tetris</em>-like shapes on a game board, each color will be distinguished by a unique three-dimensional pattern added to the plastic tiles. For games like Tumblin’ Monkeys and KerPlunk, the colors of the sticks that players are tasked with removing will be distinguished with added 3D details.</p><div><figcaption><em>Games that Mattel has made colorblind accessible will be distinguished with a new badge on the packaging.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Mattel</cite></p></div><p>The initiative will also expand to the mobile app versions of the company’s card games, with updates to <em>Uno!

In 2019, the toy maker <a href="https://nfb.org/about-us/press-room/uno-introduces-first-official-braille-deck">partnered with the National Federation of the Blind</a> to create a version of <a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/uno-braille-gmm14">Uno featuring braille</a> on every card, allowing blind and low-vision players to participate. </p><p>This also isn’t the first time Mattel has made efforts to accommodate the 350 million people around the world affected by colorblindness. In 2017, the company <a href="https://www.coloradd.net/en/news/mattel-launches-special-edition-uno-coloradd-in-a-metal-box/">partnered with ColorADD</a>, an organization that developed a unique code, based on five symbols, that allows those with color blindness to identify and distinguish the colors of an object. That partnership resulted in a <a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/uno-coloradd-hpp33">version of Uno featuring the ColorADD code</a> added to the cards, but Mattel’s latest efforts take a more streamlined approach that’s easier for players of all ages to quickly learn.</p><p><a href="https://shop.mattel.com/pages/mattel-games-colorblind-accessibility-faqs">According to Mattel</a>, its first colorblind accessible games were released in March, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Games-Adult-Players-Amazon-Exclusive/dp/B0B64G9ZSG/ref=sr_1_14?tag=theverge02-20">Uno Flex</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Games-Family-Players-Exclusive/dp/B09C916VRP/ref=sr_1_13?tag=theverge02-20">Uno All Wild</a>, ​​<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Games-Minimalista-Collectible-Featuring/dp/B089DR3N7S/ref=sr_1_15?tag=theverge02-20">Uno Minimalista</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Second-Storage-Updated-Camping-Exclusive/dp/B0BBSTJ1VH/ref=sr_1_5?tag=theverge02-20">Dos</a>, and the updated versions of Blokus, Phase 10, Skip-Bo, and KerPlunk will also be available by year’s end.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="wJBdHr"><strong>Soft caps</strong> are the key to understanding stats and rune allocation in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. If you know the soft cap breakpoints, you’ll be able to get the optimal return from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22951034/rune-farming-best-early-mid-late-game-locations">runes</a> you’ve spent — as opposed to receiving diminishing returns from excessive stats. </p>
<p id="Z7k6B8">If that sounds a bit complex, don’t worry; in this guide, we’ll explain everything there is to know about soft caps in <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p>

<hr id="54QmGo">

<p id="2ZZ8zy">If you’re no stranger to the Lands Between and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtre</em></a>e’s Realm of Shadow, you probably know the drill: defeat enemies, receive <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22951034/rune-farming-best-early-mid-late-game-locations">runes</a>, and use the runes to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22949097/stats-attributes-character-vigor-mind-endurance-strength-dexterity-intelligence-faith-arcane">level your stats</a> at a Site of Grace. Each individual stat can be leveled from 1 to 99, with 99 being the “<strong>hard cap</strong>” — the limit. </p>
<p id="zweWFS">Beware, however, that there’s a difference between leveling a stat from level 30 to level 31 or from level 50 to level 51, <strong>as you’ll receive less benefits once you’ve crossed a certain threshold</strong>. This threshold is called a “soft cap” or a “breakpoint” in <em>Elden Ring</em>. When you start leveling a stat, the returns will initially remain the same or even improve with every new level, but after reaching a certain breakpoint, the stat will be soft-capped and the returns will become less and less.</p>

<p id="Wi0mNF">For example:</p>
<ul>
<li id="1mwx78">If you level your Vigor from level 3 to level 4, your HP will increase from 312 to 322.</li>
<li id="rp7vNK">If you level your Vigor from level 4 to level 5, your HP increases from 322 to 334.</li>
</ul>
<p id="dke8Qw">As you can see, the returns per level have improved; instead of 10 HP points, you received 12 HP points the second time. These <strong>growing returns will reach their peak</strong> when leveling Vigor from level 39 to level 40, with a whopping 48 HP points gained (from 1402 HP to 1450 HP). </p>
<p id="tPrVUL">If you continue to level your Vigor from level 40 to level 41, though, your HP will improve from 1450 to 1476; a return of 26 HP points. It’s <strong>still an improvement, but obviously not nearly as grea</strong>t as the previous 48 HP points. From this point onwards, the amount of HP gained from additional Vigor levels will steadily decline. <strong>Level 40 is therefore called the first soft cap for Vigor.</strong></p>
<p id="mENB0a">And that’s not all; <strong>every </strong><em><strong>Elden Ring</strong></em><strong> stat has at least two soft cap points,</strong> up to as many as four. For Vigor, the amount of HP gained from higher levels will drop significantly after level 60, as you will only get between 3 and 6 HP points per level afterwards. Level 60 is therefore named the <strong>second soft cap</strong> for this stat.</p>

<p id="9MraIj">The existence of soft caps in <em>Elden Ring</em> doesn’t mean you should stop leveling a stat after reaching such a breakpoint, but it does mean that you need to <strong>mind your stat point allocation</strong>. Leveling Vigor from 40 to 60 can still be a great choice, but you might need to prioritize other stats before you do so, as the returns from those upgrades may be far greater.

<ul>
<li id="q2yH8X">
<strong>Level 1-40</strong>: growing returns, up to +48 HP per level.</li>
<li id="qOxbQ3">
<strong>Level 41-60</strong>: diminishing returns, between 27 and 13 HP per level.</li>
<li id="rTlYj9">
<strong>Level 61-99</strong>: diminishing returns, between 6 and 3 HP per level.</li>
</ul>
<p id="IpPECm">Vigor improves <strong>HP, fire resistance, and immunity</strong>. As mentioned in the example above, Vigor has growing returns before reaching the first soft cap at level 40. This is amazing, as it means you’ll receive more and more HP with every level up until that point. Sadly, the drop-off is rather steep, going from 48 HP to 26 HP points — and even down to only 6 per level after the second soft cap at level 60. </p>
<p id="wkrsr4">Having a high HP is extremely useful for almost any <em>Elden Ring</em> build - it’s hard enough to stay alive without giving every enemy the possibility to one-shot you. We therefore <strong>recommend to hit the first soft cap of level 40</strong>, and continue to level 60 if your playstyle needs it (frontline melee builds, for example). Anything above level 60 is a waste of runes.</p>

</ul>
<p id="lQ3KoU">Mind improves your <strong>FP and Focus</strong>. Focus is a nice defensive stat to have (protects against sleep and madness) but FP, also known as “mana,” is far more important as it’s needed to cast spells. With that in mind, you really only need as much Mind as you require FP to cast your magic. With a fully upgraded Flask of Cerulean Tears, you can restore 220 FP — one full FP bar at Mind level 38. Therefore, <strong>Mind at +38 is therefore the “sweet spot”</strong> before hitting the FP soft cap at level 50 and Focus soft cap at level 40.</p>

<p id="PDk1rt">Endurance improves <strong>stamina, maximum equipment load </strong>(allowing you to stay within the “medium load” range while wearing heavier armor, for example), and <strong>robustness </strong>(resistance to bleed and frostbite). The amount of stamina you’ll need depends on how much you consume; if you’re using a melee build, you’ll typically want at least +34 Endurance, a stamina and equipment load sweet spot that also offers some robustness.</p>
<p id="i4YAKy">If you’re an endgame player with lots of runes to spend, <strong>you may keep going until the equipment load soft cap at level 60</strong>, as this allows you to equip far better armor sets while remaining in a below-heavy load range. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-point-hope<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has released a new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's got enough to offer that the devs have officially made it the 0.10 update, meaning future roadmap updates will have higher version numbers.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Kinetic released the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2024">roadmap</a>, in which the studio promised additions like new tasks, new player models, and new ghost models, plus lots more.</p>
<p>While this update doesn't contain much of what was promised for version 0.10, it does bring an entirely new map in the form of Point Hope, a vertiginous lighthouse with ten floors and twelve rooms to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-update-0.10-eventide-point-hope.jpg?itok=auWMUHKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-update-0.10-eventide-point-hope.jpg?itok=kD_GFRp_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Abandon Hope, all ye who enter here.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to unlock Point Hope at level 15, and thanks to some of the new changes to leveling this update brings, it shouldn't take you quite as long to get there.</p>
<p>Kinetic Games says it's lowered the required experience to reach level 100 "by around 10%", which should speed up the leveling experience. Additionally, you can now "level up to 9999 for each prestige" if you really, really love playing&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes have also been implemented, including technical optimizations that have "drastically improved the performance of several areas of the game", according to Kinetic.</p>
<p>You can read the full&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update 0.10 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/6215608421522854557" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>. Sadly, they don't make any mention of the long-delayed&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">console release</a>, but hopefully, we'll hear more about that sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Different ghosts require different equipment and strategies to track, so you'll have to alter your approach to make sure that you deal with whatever spirit is haunting the place you're investigating.</p>
<p><i>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</i>is available right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">on PC via Steam</a>. It's also due to come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S at some point in the future.</p>

It's hotter than the inside of a horse here, so what better time to play an RPG about driving randomly through the desert in search of enlightenment. The RPG in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/broke-signal-badlands-a-world-of-desert-adventure">Broke Signal Badlands: A World of Desert Adventure</a>, and yes, that's a very upbeat subtitle for a game in which you can perish after getting your hand stuck in the door of an abandoned Fonts Museum, or while yanking cacti out of your foot. There are gunfights, too, with dice serving as bullets, but so far, I've only managed to die of pathetic human error and clumsiness. Consider me unenlightened, but enthused.

</p><!--more-->
<p>
Coming this year to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2432490/Broke_Signal_Badlands_A_World_of_Desert_Adventure/">Steam</a> with an older version already for sale on <a href="https://forwardinstinct.itch.io/broke-signal-badlands">Itch</a>, Broke Signal Badlands casts you as a line man (a telephone repair engineer, I think) who has abruptly decided to steal the company truck and go on a mystical roadtrip. Over the course of the subsequent hour or two, you'll WASDrive across a tilted 2D map painted in glaring shades of hazard yellow and Vimto purple, investigating landmarks such as forgotten mines and dealing with fleeting pop-up events such as hitchhikers.  
</p>
<p>
I'm not entirely sure which technology or medium or period the visual direction is channelling, but I like it. The map reminds me of both the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a>'s overworld and the pulp comic stylings of last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fabulous-fear-machine-out-today-is-a-strategy-game-of-engrossing-evil">The Fabulous Fear Machine</a>. The HUD is interestingly abrasive: scratchy illustrations of events and quests materialise slowly from the bottom up, as though slithering out of the belly of a fax machine. This invests the accompanying text with a peculiar mixture of suspense and irritation, as you either tap your cactus-punctured foot waiting for the full scene to reveal itself, or shrink back at the thought of seeing the horrors described. The writing itself is as sparing and dry as the bones of a cable repairguy who went looking for himself on the barrens and suffered a mortal wound while tidying up tumbleweeds after dark (yes, this is one of the quests).

The weird western premise and vignette-driven structure obviously recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a>, but rather than being an experimental episodic adventure like KRZ, Broke Signal Badlands is a shortform pen-and-paper-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in the vein of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-horror">World Of Horror</a>. Again, the game is a search for enlightenment. How does one become enlightened? By Mad Maxing your stats, apparently. 
</p>
<p>
There are three - Guile, which describes how crafty and underhand you are, Strength, which describes how likely you are to fall and hurt yourself while scaling a mesa, and Attunement, which describes both your level of empathy and your sensitivity to stuff like passing UFOs. Each point you plunk into a stat gives you a die you can roll to complete or fail an event or quest. You'll need plenty of Guile, for example, if you're going to sneak into the back of that Fonts Museum. More Guile than me, anyway. 

</p><p>If you can level each stat all the way to six, you'll pierce the veil of ignorance and emerge from the badlands a more complete and rounded being. More likely, you will injure yourself repeatedly, with each injury reducing the number of quest actions you can perform each day. When that number falls to zero, it's game over.
</p>
<p>
Broke Signal Badlands is apparently based on real-life trips to the Mojave - some of the illustrations look like they were created using photographs from those journeys. I do have to ask whether developers Forward Instinct found enlightenment in the process, and whether this game is the result? If you like the atmosphere, but would prefer to play something with more lavish writing, I recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine">Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24185081/still-wakes-the-deep-review-narrative-platform-horror-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2u5cg9">The best horror games stick around long after credits have rolled, squirming in and tickling the back of your brain. <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> has stuck around in my noggin, provoking questions that I know I will never have the answers to. There are plenty of familiar elements in <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, and in less deft hands, it could come off as derivative or redundant. But the atmosphere, the characters, and the restraint exercised by developer The Chinese Room all come together to create a special four-hour experience that I can’t forget.</p>
<p id="OmTf8b"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> takes place on a Scottish oil rig in 1975. The protagonist, Caz McLeary, is dodging an assault charge by taking a position here. The game gives us a little bit of exposition via a letter from Caz’s wife, and then we’re off to meet some of Caz’s co-workers. There’s a whole crew of boisterous blue-collar workers here, but we only get a couple of quick conversations with most of them before shit hits the fan. The voice acting is superb and very Scottish, so it might be worth turning on subtitles (if you aren’t familiar with Scottish accents) to catch the intricacies of these conversations.</p>
<p id="QjXWa1">A greedy manager insists the oil rig drill down into something that feels “off” to the workers, and something ancient awakens. Some crew members die, others are injured, and some are trapped under wreckage or in a diving bell. The early game is a very industrial horror experience, and Caz’s electrical skills are essential to try and salvage things. It’s chaotic, but the crew guesses at first that it was an air pocket or some similar, mundane catastrophe. They’ll soon be proven wrong, but the crew’s initial reactions set a tone of fear very well.</p>

<p id="7TRu7N">From here, Caz is tasked with trying to help as many of his colleagues survive as possible. One early scene that sticks with me is of a rookie diver, stuck in a diving bell, screaming incoherently. His partner, distraught with grief and guilt, is trying to get him out. At the time, this seemed like the morally right thing to do, but those primal howls gave me the unsettling feeling that freeing him was the wrong choice. Sure enough, whatever emerged from the drill began writhing and climbing up the oil rig, claiming and corrupting any workers it could reach.</p>
<p id="vCHHFK">This is where <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> really shines. My corrupted co-workers become my biggest obstacle. They’re out of their minds with pain and fear, and their bipedal forms twist and contort into something unrecognizable. The monster designs are deeply unnerving, and The Chinese Room did a fantastic job at allowing them to pursue and menace Caz while never giving the player a full look at them. Being around the supernatural creature from the depths or the monsters it produces obscures Caz’s vision; a colorful oil-like substance dances around the colors of his perception. </p>
<p id="SOdJ7s">It would have been very easy for <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> to overplay its hand and end up being lost in the crowded genre of hallway horror. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: A troubled man flees the consequences of his actions, only to find himself ensnared in a supernatural nightmare. Add in memories of a sobbing spouse and a protagonist desperate for immersion, and you’ve got a narrative going. But The Chinese Room strategically refuses to provide the player with all the answers they want. </p>
<p id="VkdQuJ">It’s easy to imagine a weaker presentation, where Caz stumbles across diary entries explaining a cult taking root on the oil rig, rituals to summon the antagonistic force, and definitive answers to his (and the player’s) questions. These scenes might be sprinkled with gratuitous gore and cheap jump scares. Instead, I walked away from <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> feeling like I had experienced a carefully honed story. I still have questions, but that feels intentional; it’s proof that in horror, less is more.</p>

<p id="YYMWlm">It’s a shame that the platforming doesn’t hit quite as well. It’s very functional; Caz has to make his way through the oil rig, trying to find a way out. The creature from the depths is growing up over the rig, breaking the structure down. Once safe corridors flood, Caz must swim through dark and claustrophobic hallways. Former colleagues stalk critical junctures, weeping and wailing. But my journey feels like I’m on rails; unlike a <em>Dead Space</em> or a <em>Prey</em> where I’m exploring a structure, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> feels like it’s guiding me along a predetermined course. </p>
<p id="VoXaR3">There are points where this works really well, as you can watch the supernatural organism grow and evolve its way across the oil rig. Other times, that structure feels clumsy. For instance, stumbling across a platforming sequence where each jump is marked by a big splash of yellow paint feels a bit awkward. One thing I enjoyed is Caz’s blunt reaction to each subsequent bit of bad news he gets; after being ordered around by NPCs in a hundred other horror games, I appreciated Caz calling his colleagues out for bossing him around. It’s also deeply relatable to watch Caz nearly fall to his death and curse up a storm.</p>
<p id="V401dv">Indeed, I started <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> hating Caz, but by the end of the game, he had won me over. The finale was a complete gut punch, and for the first time in a while, I sobbed over the conclusion of a story. It’s not necessarily a bummer ending — I’ll spare you the details — but it is an emotional one. Each individual element of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> has been done before, but they’re brought together marvelously here, and the end result is a horror classic.</p>

Anyways, Bitvela looks like a really cute and pixelated version of the classic map, and as usual it will be able to host 12 players in variants of popular 6v6 modes.<br></p><p>Though the majority of the player models will remain semi-realistic, their heads will balloon in size as you rack up kills and only dying will reset it. There are only three possible head sizes: small, medium, and large. Think of this fun little playlist as <em>MW3</em>’s own neat homage to Big Head mode in <em>Goldeneye</em>, where you could input a cheat code to make your friends’ heads bigger, making it that much simpler to line up headshots.</p><p>Even though having a big head makes you an easier target, the benefit to slaying so hard that it <em>literally </em>goes to your head is that the size of your dome also amplifies your score. For example, holding an objective in Hardpoint with a bigger head will net you and your team more points. The same goes for capturing a flag in Domination, collecting a tag in Kill Confirmed, or just getting a kill in good ol’ fashioned Team Deathmatch.</p><p>Bit Party will be available to play in <em>MW3</em> beginning June 26, and will run until July 3 as part of a “Retro Warfare” event. Additionally, players will be able to shop for a pack on <em>MW3</em>’s store called the 8-Bit Bliz bundle, which will give them access to pixelated versions of the protagonists of the <em>Modern Warfare </em>series, including Ghost, Soap MacTavish, Captain Price, and Farah.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With the release of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522484/" data-ref-id="1100-6522484">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion, Elden Ring is once again one a must-play game. If you missed out on it when it first launched in 2022 and you're considering picking it up, you might feel apprehensive when you hear how tough the game is. Fret not, because in a new video, GameSpot is ready to show you how you can survive and thrive in The Lands Between.</p><p>First off, if there's one golden rule with Elden Ring and other Souls-like games, it's that you need to be patient. Be Patient Pete--be the Tarnished warrior who approaches every battle with a wary nature and who waits for an opening. As GameSpot's Devante Chisolm explains in the video, treat every encounter like a conversation: one where you can respond to a question with a perfectly timed attack when you have the chance to speak.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How To Be Good At Elden Ring (If You're Bad At Souls Games)</p>
      </div>
<p>There are a few other tips to help you out--or you can check GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-guides-hub-classes-summons-and-more/1100-6501032/">Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree guides hub</a> for more in-depth walkthroughs--like embracing growth through failure, using your free will to say "nope" to fights, and over-leveling your character to stand a better chance against some tough opponents. Did we mention that you should over-level your character? You should definitely over-level your character: we cannot stress this enough.</p><p>Throw in some helpful gameplay assists like summoning friends or AI companions to give you a helping hand, and you'll be on the right path toward becoming an Elden Lord.</p><p>"With all that Shadow of the Erdtree offers to accompany what exists in the Lands Between, the story of Elden Ring now feels complete and its world whole, and it's a staggering achievement," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>. "It's dark fantasy done masterfully; rich in detail and intricate in its construction; a place that feels dangerous and cruel, filled with memorable characters, fascinating rules, mind-bending concepts, and competing ideologies."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-machine-god-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fatshark has released the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Secrets of the Machine God update, and it contains a new mission for you to try out, plus new weapons and more.</p>
<p>The patch is live on Steam right now, and it'll be going live on other platforms "shortly" as well, so if you're playing on Xbox or you've got the game via the Microsoft Store, you shouldn't have too much longer to wait.</p>
<p>First up, the new Clandestium Gloriana mission (which Fatshark says was "previously mentioned as Atelium Foundryplex Omega V"), will take you into the depths of Tertium to reawaken an Adeptus Mechanicus facility. It's got a new "variable end event" to increase its replayability as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-new-mission.jpg?itok=_JXKU1aF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-new-mission.jpg?itok=yXE23V70 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This land serves as the backdrop for your new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>mission.</figcaption></figure><p>New weapons have also been added, with the Ogryn class getting its first two-handed weapon in the form of the Pickaxe. If you've ever felt like Ogryn melee attacks lack a certain heft, this weapon should do a lot to redress the balance.</p>
<p>Naturally, a number of quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks have also been implemented. Several missions have been changed according to community feedback, and&nbsp;<em>Darktide</em>'s crosshair has undergone some changes to make it a more reliable tool as well.</p>
<p>That's all in addition to a ton of bug fixes and minor improvements that work diligently behind the scenes to (hopefully) make your&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>experience a more pleasant one, if such a thing can be said about this miserable hive city.</p>

<p>If you want to know everything that's new, you can take a look at the full&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Secrets of the Machine God patch notes <a href="https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/secrets-of-the-machine-god-out-now-pt-1/96131" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>....and <a href="https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/secrets-of-the-machine-god-out-now-pt-2/96132" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here as well</a>. The notes were so long Fatshark split them into two posts, so I hope you like reading patch notes!</p>
<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>is a co-op first-person shooter set in the hive city of Tertium. Newly conscripted to the Emperor's Inquisition, you must assist Explicator Zola in containing the forces of Nurgle and ensuring they don't overrun Tertium.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, the game is quite similar to Fatshark's&nbsp;<em>Vermintide</em>, although the&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>setting means everything's much less fantasy-inflected and much more grungy and industrial. If you loved&nbsp;<em>Vermintide</em>, though, you'll almost certainly like this too, and there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40000-darktide-2024-plans">lots more on the way</a> for the devoted faithful.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/warhammer-40-000-darktide/9nt3wc6rkbvq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, as well as on Xbox Series X|S.

Robert House runs New Vegas in the game and is an integral part of any story in the setting. Since New Vegas appears in the final shot of season one, we know the second season will feature the iconic location in a big way. If Mr. House is involved, it means that the show will likely need to make one particular ending of <em>New Vegas </em>canon: the one in which the player sides with Mr. House in the conflict for the Hoover Dam. </p><figure id="" data-id="2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-recommend-id="image://2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr. House appears on a computer screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr. House appears on a computer screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-recommend-id="image://2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr. House appears on a computer screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This ending establishes that Mr. House will continue to rule New Vegas in the years following the game, with the city described as a despotic vision of pre-war glory in which the streets are “orderly, efficient, cold.” However, if the show takes the same storytelling approach in season two as it did in season one, there is another option. Mr. House could appear in flashbacks, further revealing the machinations that led to the apocalypse in the first place. If the show takes the flashback route, it could feature Mr. House while continuing to play coy about the specific events of<em> New Vegas</em> to keep each player’s ending equally canonical, for now.</p><p>Whichever ending of the game the show chooses to go with (if any in particular), it still won’t answer the question of what happened to New Vegas after the game. The show takes place 15 years after <em>New Vegas</em>,<em> </em>and in that glimpse we get of it in the first season’s final moments, we see it as a ruined city bereft of its signature lights and splendor. What happened in those 15 years remains a mystery the second season will likely dig into, and whether in flashback or not, Mr. House is sure to play a big role in revealing the answers.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-no-complaints-palworld/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In January, shortly after the sensational ‘Palworld’ was released, Nintendo announced that it was investigating the game for any signs of plagiarism. Later, Nintendo’s president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said that the company would ‘take appropriate action’ if their IP had been infringed upon. Nintendo has long been known as a stalwart company where copyright issues are concerned, but it has been confirmed that six months after Palworld was released, Nintendo has yet to make an official complaint.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perhaps-it-s-fine">Perhaps It’s Fine</h2>



<p>In many ways, Palworld was a flash in the pan. It blew up overnight, with millions of players flooding the game, which was being presented online as ‘Pokémon with guns’. In Palworld, players are charged with exploring a vast open world, collecting and upgrading ‘Pals’, crafting items, and building bases. It was a monumental success when it was released in January, soaring up the charts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-growth-emergency-epic-meeting/">prompting emergency meetings at Epic</a> Games because it threatened to bring down the servers hosting it.</p>



<p>Despite Nintendo’s claims that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-pokemon-company-says-they-will-investigate-palworld-for-ip-infringement/">launching an investigation into Palworl</a>d just days after it blew up, it seems as though nothing has come of it. Pocket Pair, the developer behind Palworld, confirmed recently that no complaints have been received and no legal proceedings have been kicked off, suggesting that all is well between Nintendo and Palworld.</p>



<p>Speaking to Game File’s Stephen Totilo, Takuro Mizobe, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the head at Pocket Pair, said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo and the Pokémon Company didn’t say anything to us. Of course I love Pokémon and respect it. I grew up with it, in my generation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Palworld has suffered a fall from grace since dominating the charts six months ago. It hit an all-time peak player count of around 2.1 million users on Steam but now averages around 18,000 peak players per month. It has also dropped off entirely on streaming and content platforms – but that’s the lifecycle of most games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1805617622970511468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> via X, the Dead by Daylight account officially confirmed that Lara Croft will be the next survivor and release on July 16, 2024.</p>



<p>The developers elaborated on Croft’s perks in the full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1do8343/810_ptb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTB patch notes</a> released today. Lara Croft will include the Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist perks.</p>



<p>Finesse will make Croft’s fast vaults 20 percent faster. Hardened can allow Croft to reveal the Killer’s aura instead of screaming. Finally, the Specialist perk introduces a token system that can lower the maximum required generator progress.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today’s patch notes also detail some balancing changes coming to The Knight, The Singularity, maps, and more. Fortunately, that does include some extensive bug fixes.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive revealed it would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">face new layoffs</a> affecting nearly 100 employees. However, Dead by Daylight continues to expand with impressive new updates and collaborations.</p>



<p>In May, fans also got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at Project T</a>, which is set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>



<p>Besides Dead by Daylight, Lara Croft has previously seen other collaborations such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-pack-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Tomb Raider pack</a> from last year. </p>



<p>More recently, there’s a lot of traction around Tomb Raider adaptations. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action series</a> is coming to Amazon Prime Video. Animated series The Legend of Lara Croft is also coming in October 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hayley-atwell-lara-croft-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring Hayley Atwell</a> as Croft.</p>
