		<p>Developer Full Circle has launched a brand new blog series in relation to the development of Skate, and that blog is called The Grind. In the debut post, Full Circle has released details about the playtests that have taken place for the game, stats from those playtests, how the game will function, and details about microtransactions.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. Insider Playtest Highlights: February 2025 | skate." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WesoA7BEZbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It was previously confirmed that Skate will be a free to play title, and now on the back of that Full Circle has stated that there will be no offline mode for the game. In its The Grind blog post, the development team said, <em>“The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection. That is probably not much of a surprise if you’ve been in our playtest.”</em></p>
<p>Speaking of the Skate playtest, Full Circle has confirmed that over 200,000 players have been invited to take part and provide feedback. Another thing about the playtest is that it has had microtransactions active within it. The reason given is so Full Circle can figure out the pricing models that will seem fair to players. Full Circle has also stated that anyone who has spent money in the playtest so far will get the value of that money back in the form of Skate’s premium in game currency San Van Bucks. The game will feature earnable currency called Rip Chips, and there will be no loot boxes. Full Circle has also reiterated that any new areas that get added to the game will be available to all players for free. In terms of some playtest stats, Full Circle has released how many times certain tricks have been performed.</p>

<ul>
<li>More than 16 million kickflips including nollie and varials.</li>
<li>More than 4.8 million 50-50 Grinds landed – nothin’ but bolts!</li>
<li>The Longest Grind (so far) – more than 200 meters! That’s about 15 school buses!</li>
<li>More than 40 million Total Wipeouts – Ouch!</li>
<li>More than 6.5 million Challenges completed</li>
</ul>
<p>Skate will feature cross play and cross progression. Full Circle has also stated the game is still scheduled to release into Early Access this year, but a release date is yet to be set.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-5-6-takes-you-back-to-mondstadt-in-may.1173753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.6, and the main story chapter in this update will take you back to the land of Mondstadt for an "interlude chapter".</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">last update</a> took you to a lava-filled volcano and introduced you to the last tribe of Natlan, Version 5.6, also known as "Paralogism", takes things in a more nostalgic direction. It's launching across all platforms on May 7th.</p>

<p>In the new Archon Quest Interlude chapter, you'll travel back to Mondstadt in order to take part in an "unexpected trial" involving Albedo. You'll be investigating the crime associated with the trial, meeting figures from your past like Venti and the Knights of Favonius.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.6-release-date-escoffier.jpg?itok=EjgsvBwf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.6-release-date-escoffier.jpg?itok=ytNa1910 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As ever,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.6 will introduce new characters for your team.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but you'll be defending Mondstadt from monsters (or perhaps that should be mondsters), as well as taking part in a "magical trial" to secure the support of powerful mage Lady Alice in the defense of the city.</p>

<p>Two new characters will also be joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.6. The first, Escoffier, is a spear-wielding Cryo user who "blends culinary flair with elemental power". She can deal pretty heavy damage and heal allies thanks to her Cooking Mek.</p>

<p>Joining Escoffier in this update is Ifa, a 4-star Anemo catalyst wielder who hails from Natlan. He can automatically heal active characters when their HP drops below a certain point, making him ideal for players who prefer to get stuck into the action.</p>

<p>Escoffier and Ifa will be available during Version 5.6's first half, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-celebrates-version-43s-release-with-navias-graceful-gunbrella-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Navia</a>. Following that, reruns of Kinich and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-raiden-shogun-baal-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Raiden Shogun</a> will be available in the second half, and the Chronicled Wish is also coming back, this time with characters from Inazuma up for grabs.</p>




<p>As always, three codes are also available for you to grab some free stuff in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, and here they are.</p>

<ul><li>GI56Paralogism - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>ChefEscoffier0507 - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>IfaCacucu0507 - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices. Version 5.6, "Paralogism", launches on May 7th.</p>

But sometimes, the choices make perfect sense. The next life-sized <em>Pokémon </em>plush won’t be just <em>one</em> of these critters; it will be nine—all nine Eevee evolutions, to be exact.</p><p>Eevee is one of the most popular Pokémon in the series. Part of what makes the little fox-like creature so beloved is that it can evolve into one of eight (for now) forms, based on different energies. Everyone has a different favorite “Eeveelution” and there are a lot of fans who love the whole line so much that they’ll buy all of their merchandise in a set. Well those sickos better be ready to pay a pretty penny for the life-sized Eevee evolution plushies. At the moment, the nine plushies have only been announced for sale on the Japanese Pokémon Center website, but these do tend to make their way overseas shortly after. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokeshopper.net/news&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokeshopper.net/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PokéShopper</em></a></span>, the Japanese sale for Eevee, Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon runs until May 19. The Eevee plush, which is much smaller than its evolutions, costs 3,850 yen (roughly $27), while the larger fully-evolved plushies are 44,000 yen (around $306). That means collecting the whole range would cost you almost $2,500. Click through the gallery to see them in all their life-sized glory.</p><p><strong>Update, 4/25/25, 10:42 a.m. Eastern: </strong>The plushies are now on sale on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/large-plush&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/large-plush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Pokémon Center store</a></span>...and they’re a whopping $400.

            <p>Gabriel Luna - who plays Joel's brother Tommy in the TV adaptation of The Last of Us - has spoken more about the second season's latest episode, specifically a key change made to Joel's story.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us, both the game and the show, below. </strong></p>

</figure>
<p>The most recent episode of The Last of Us takes place in the frozen and snow-covered wilderness of Jackson County, Wyoming. During the course of the episode, the residential settlement of Jackson is assaulted by a horde of infected, while Joel and Dina - played in the show by Pedro Pascal and Isebela Merced respectively - are on patrol in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>This is a change from The Last of Us Part 2 game, where Joel is on patrol with his brother Tommy, while Dina is on patrol with Ellie. Additionally, the show gives Tommy his own standalone hero moment not seen in the game, as he remains in Jackson and has a rather tense confrontation with a Bloater (among many, <em>many</em> other infected).</p>
<p>While all this is happening in the show, Dina and Joel come across Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, who convinces them to come back to the chalet she and her group are holding up in rather than heading back to Jackson.</p>
<p>In both the game and the show, it is this decision that marks the beginning of the end for Joel, as once his identity is revealed (in the show by Dina calling out to get the attention of her patrol partner, in the game by Tommy introducing them both), Abby kills him in revenge for her father's death at his hands.</p>

<p>Now, reflecting on the tweaks to the source material, Luna says he is glad the show changed Tommy's part in 'outing' Joel to Abby, adding he didn't believe the character would have been "that careless" in reality.</p>
<p>"The truth is, back when we were doing the first season, I talked to [showrunner] Craig [Mazin] and [game creator] Neil [Druckmann] about it. Would Tommy be that careless to reveal Joel's identity? As a seasoned veteran, somebody who had to protect this city and keep it safe, would he be so trusting of strangers? And then to walk into this ambush and be knocked out for that moment, unable to use any of his strength and skills to protect his brother, it always pinged in my mind - I wouldn't say false, but I don't know if Tommy would have been that trusting to walk into that trap," Luna said in conversation with <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a64523873/gabriel-luna-the-last-of-us-season-2-interview/">Esquire</a>.</p>
<p>The actor revealed Mazin, however, already had an idea in mind for the show. "Before the strike, he was starting to break the stories," Luna shared. "He sent me this Bible-long text about where Tommy is and what he's doing instead. And it floored me. I was so excited. I'm getting goose bumps now thinking about it."</p>
<p>Luna added that having Dina present when Joel was killed rather than Tommy serves her story arc in The Last of Us  as well. Dina is "somebody who still loves Joel and sees him as family, and would be devastated when this all goes down", the actor reasoned.</p>

			<p>Today, Funcom announced that a large scale beta weekend (with no NDA) for Dune: Awakening will take place between Friday, May 9 and Monday, May 12, allowing a significant number of players to try the game ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new launch date of June 10</a>. Fans can attempt to get in by requesting access via the game's Steam page. However, those who aren't lucky enough to be automatically invited may still obtain a code by watching the Global LAN Party Broadcast, which will be broadcast live from both London and PAX East. Funcom said tens of thousands of beta codes will be given away during the stream.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed by the article's headline, Funcom provided select press outlets, including ourselves, with advanced access to this beta build. Content-wise, this is the same thing you'll be playing in the upcoming public weekend: there are around twenty to twenty-five hours of gameplay, featuring the Hagga Basin South Region, the Eastern and Western Vermilius Gap Region, and parts of the story's first Act.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>These first few hours are, perhaps unsurprisingly, almost entirely devoted to the survival and building aspects of Dune: Awakening. After character creation, where the player is given the choice of their starting skill tree, home planet, and background (noble or working class, for example), the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit tasks you with a not-so-simple objective: head to Arrakis and find the surviving Fremen, who have been reportedly slaughtered by the Sardaukar, the Emperor's elite military force. The journey immediately starts to get complicated when the airship is shot down by a rocket launcher, leaving your character stranded in the desert with practically nothing on them. Thankfully, a mysterious character provides help and guidance through the very first part of the journey.</p>
<p>At this stage, it's all about surviving. First and foremost, there's the need to keep hydrated. This is Arrakis, after all, and water is the second most precious commodity after spice. Initially, you must gather dew from the few plants you'll encounter, though that kind of hydration can only fill you up a little. You also have to collect other resources, such as copper and metal, to create a variety of tools that can help you craft new items for your character and your base. To establish your property, you must first place a subfief console, which in turn lets you start building the base's foundation, walls, doors, roof, etc. Of course, some areas are off limits, but even the initial map is quite large and offers many places where building is allowed.</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll build a weak version of the iconic stillsuit, which helps greatly with water management. You'll also get access to a blood extractor that can be used to exsanguinate defeated foes. Blood can be consumed as is if you're desperately out of liquids, but that can make you sick. The ideal process is to bring it back to base and process it through a water purifier first.</p>
<p>You'll also need to pay a lot of care to sunlight exposure. When the sun is up and you're out in the open, a meter will quickly fill to urge you to the shadows. If the meter is filled, water starts depleting even faster. The game has a dynamic day and night cycle, so you'll only have to worry about this factor during daytime; however, the desert is patrolled by Sardaukar drones at nighttime. You'll want to avoid them at all costs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The last big environmental challenge is, of course, the sandworm. This is arguably the biggest threat early on in Dune: Awakening; whenever you cross the open sands, and depending on your current speed, there's a risk of alerting the deadly creature. Whenever that happens, players must rush to the nearest rocky ground - being swallowed by the sandworm also means irrevocably losing whatever was in your inventory (on the other hand, in PvE maps, dying by other means lets you rush back to your corpse to retrieve the dropped items).</p>
<p>Admittedly, I died a couple of times because of the sandworm, but it eventually became less of a bother, especially after I built my first sandbike. This is a fairly involved process of assembling various components, but it is well worth it. It's a massive improvement in your ability to travel the hostile game world that also offers no fast travel options, at least at this stage. Exploration feels good, at any rate, also thanks to the free-climbing (you can attempt to climb any surface, provided you've got enough stamina to make it to the top) feature, the shigawire claw (essentially a grappling hook), and the suspensor belt that lets you glide down without taking any fall damage.</p>
<p>Of course, Dune: Awakening also features a lot of combat. Melee is a big part of fights in this game, and there's a full gamut of actions available here, from blocking to dodging, from regular attacks to charged attacks. You can also equip three active abilities and three passive techniques from your skill trees.</p>
<p>At least in this beta, though, enemy variety was practically nonexistent. They're all ruthless (and nameless) killers and scavengers, hiding in the nooks and crannies of the desert or inside proper bases. In my explorations of the Hagga Basin map (which, interestingly, also resets its points of interest every once in a while due to Coriolis sandstorms <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the Deep Desert PvP map</a>), I also found the botanical testing stations that Funcom previously discussed. Based on their description, I thought they'd be group dungeons, but at least the first one was just a regular soloable base without any boss-like encounters. They do have great loot and a few audio recordings for lore aficionados.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Eventually, you'll run into the first outposts with NPCs that can provide you with contracts or even ask you to join their faction (for now, just Atreides or Harkonnen). There are a few missions here and there, but Dune: Awakening is not a game you'll play for the story. At its core, it is instead a survival sandbox crafting game like many others, albeit well-tailored to the Dune setting. What could truly set it apart from the veritable sea of such games is the MMO-like endgame part, where players form clans and join either Atreides and Harkonnen in a cyclic war for control of Arrakis and its spice, with potentially hundreds of players participating in large scale battles featuring combined arms warfare with ornithopters, buggies, and the ever-present threat of the sandworm to all parties. However, this was not in the beta, so we'll have to wait until launch before properly assessing the game.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words about performance. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and can look pretty at times, even though its Lumen global illumination is not accelerated with hardware ray tracing. The announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation</a> is not yet available in the game, but the really worrying aspect is that even on a high-end PC (RTX 5090, Ryzen 7 9800X3D), stuttering was a constant presence during my play sessions.</p>
<p>I didn't measure it with software because Funcom may still be in the middle of optimizing the game. In fact, it could be the major reason behind the small delay from May 20 to June 10. Having said that, you can clearly see all the stutters in the gameplay video embedded above. Let's hope they can significantly improve optimization in these last few weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

						
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, linear FPS from Reburn, the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine. While 4A Games was initially founded and entirely located in Ukraine, as Reburn chief executive officer Dmytro Lymar explained to Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-developer-qa-powered-by-unreal-engine-4-main-story-to-last-5-hours/">previously</a>, when the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine in 2014, the studio split between a Ukraine-based team and another based in Malta.</p>
<p>But Reburn didn't start developing La Quimera over a decade ago. Development began in 2020, after work on Metro Exodus was complete, and the studio took a new name shortly after Embracer Group acquired 4A Games.</p>
<p>Suppose you're like me, and you like a good story-driven, linear game, particularly a good story-driven FPS game, which feels like a rarity in the modern video game landscape. In that case, as I was, you'd probably be very excited by the pitch of 'developers who worked on the Metro games making a new sci-fi story-driven FPS that can also be played entirely in co-op.'</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, my excitement was quickly diminished when I sat down to play La Quimera. I'm sorry to say that my favorite thing about it is that it's a short game, and I was able to finish it in a little less than 5 hours.</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the fact that I absolutely cannot imagine what it was like for the Reburn team making this game over the last five years. I also appreciate that it's not asking for a full $70 with its much more budget-friendly $30 price tag. But a bad game is a rip-off at any price, and not only is La Quimera not worth your time, but in its current state, I wouldn't even say it is ready to be released.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I don't have the hardware to display La Quimera in its best graphical light. I grew up a console player and built my first PC, the same one I currently play games and what I used to play La Quimera five years ago, aiming for what I felt was mid-range and, more realistically, what I could afford at the time. It's got a Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB of RAM, and an RTX 2060 in it that have always been up to the task for whatever I've thrown at it, which has honestly mostly been indie games I got for cheap on Steam and whatever else I couldn't play on my PS5 or Xbox Series X.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I'm not trying to play at 4K/120fps with my 1440p monitor that caps out at 60fps. I built my PC the way I did because I needed a new computer at the time, so why not make it something that could decently play games as well? I'm giving all that context so that you understand when I say La Quimera is a bad game, I'm not talking about performance issues that a beefier PC would likely be able to push through.</p>
<p>I'm talking about bad audio that was either delayed or simply not there, and poor audio mixing that made loud crash scenes sound quiet. I'm talking about bugs like being unable to move my reticle up or down when aiming down sight on a controller, an issue that doesn't exist when I play with my keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Enemies that are not fun to fight, whether humans or robots, the latter being half the combat encounters you'll face, should you play this game. Weapons that don't sound or feel like they have any weight to them, or feel like they're making an impact despite their admittedly cool designs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Writing and voice acting that made me wonder whether the lines from the human characters were meant to sound as stilted as the lines from your AI companion or any other voice that came from a machine. A story that set up threads which go nowhere, as if to set up a sequel that I can tell you now I have no interest in playing.</p>
<p>Nothing about La Quimera feels finished. Every part feels like a disjointed piece of the project that the team at Reburn stitched together without actually creating a singular image. Even the gameplay sits at the top of the list of positive takeaways from La Quimera by virtue of not being entirely bad.</p>
<p>The futuristic setting and the exosuit you wear after the opening mission, which is one of three, provide you with more options to make each combat encounter a little more interesting to get through. The scanner you get paired with a weapon that can shoot through walls helps to give you time to breathe in La Quimera's more explosive firefights without actually taking yourself out of the fight.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Being able to call up your own defensive drones to even the odds against the ones thrown at you, or taking a few moments to catch an enemy by surprise by entering a cloaked mode, are features I appreciate in a futuristic shooter. Not that there's any real stealth gameplay to go along with that latter feature, mind you, since enemies are quickly aware of your position once you've taken one of them out with a sneaky attack.</p>
<p>Regarding its setting, once again, I was intrigued by the idea of a futuristic dystopia set in Latin America, but what La Quimera's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a> describes as a "<em>lush jungle</em>" and&nbsp;"<em>breathtaking megalopolis</em>" boils down to uninspiring levels with more grey than green on display and a story that throws in the odd Spanish word or phrase while everything else is in English.</p>
<p>I will say that it's clear a lot of work went into trying to make La Quimera look very sleek. I'm sure it would look more than fine if I had top-of-the-line hardware, but that proves that La Quimera is all sizzle and no steak. And while I'm not complaining that I didn't have to spend too long with it before the game ended, the short runtime doesn't give La Quimera any room to go anywhere.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I could replay the missions to earn more of the in-game currency and upgrade my exosuit, but I can't say what I would get out of it. Maybe a fun video game, after I've played it enough times to get the rest of the upgrades, but why would the 'real' fun arrive so late in the experience?</p>
<p>Also, I will note that playing this ahead of release, I didn't get the chance to play it in co-op, which is an aspect of La Quimera that is consistently highlighted in its marketing. I could see it being more fun with friends at my side, jokingly mimicking the flat dialogue and running through the whole game in the same time it would take us to play a few rounds of whatever multiplayer game we could have been playing instead.</p>
<p>But that's not a winning argument for why you and your friends should download La Quimera and spend time with it over other games. And, as someone who was playing solo, the fact that La Quimera requires you to always be online, whether you're playing with other people or not, is absolutely a point against it. If I'm not playing with anyone, and it's a single-player experience, an offline mode should be available that lets me pause the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/La-Quimera-screenshot-13-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I really wanted to like La Quimera. The idea of a quick, intense FPS that tells a good story that I could play through again with my friends is one I can get behind. Besides, it's not like there haven't been <a href="http://wccftech.com/titanfall-2-4-players-co-op-revealed-new-trailer-released/">excellent FPS games</a> with a short campaign that are incredibly fun to go back to again and again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, La Quimera isn't one of them. While that could be a result of not enough development time, it's difficult to see this game improving tenfold if only its bugs were fixed. A lot more needs to be changed and reworked to bring La Quimera up to par to compete in today's overcrowded FPS market, even if it is one of the few offering a single-player focus over a multiplayer one.</p>

				<p>La Quimera is an incomplete game, a mixture of stitched together parts that don't come together to make a full image. The amount of bugs are clear indicators that this game needed more time in development, but so is the underwhelming story and gameplay that aren't given enough time to go anywhere. If La Quimera was communicated as an Early Access release, then I'd be more hopeful for what's to come, but if this is meant to be the full game, it's not one that's worth your time.</p>

							<li>Stilted writing and voice acting with a story that goes nowhere
</li><li>Gameplay doesn't expand in a meaningful way
</li><li>Litany of audio and visual bugs
</li><li>Ultimately feels like an unfinished game that needed more time in development</li>						</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breath-of-fire-iv-gog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced a re-release of the classic PS1-era JRPG&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, which is now available via PC a quarter-century after its initial release on the PlayStation.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1915692579011649567" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, over 22,000 people voted for <i>Breath of Fire IV</i>'s inclusion as part of GOG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which aims to support games long after their publishers or developers cease doing so.</p>

<p>According to GOG, the new PC release of&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, which appears to be based on the original 2003 PC version rather than the PS1 version, is "fully optimized" for modern machines, sporting Windows 10 and 11 support, English and Japanese localizations, and various new options.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-planks.jpg?itok=qe_nIIan 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-planks.jpg?itok=lhmfTILX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>is now available on PC thanks to the folks at GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than those improvements, though, this remains very much the same&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>you may already know and love from 2000, and if you don't (and you're a JRPG fan), then I'd recommend checking it out tout de suite.</p>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, either. Other games joining the GOG Preservation Program today include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Realms of the Haunting</em>, and three&nbsp;<em>Ultima&nbsp;</em>games, thus "completing the&nbsp;<em>Ultima&nbsp;</em>series in the Program", according to GOG.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the fourth game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire&nbsp;</em>series. Like previous games, this one also has you playing as Ryu, although it's not the same Ryu in each game.</p>

<p>This time around, your perspective is split between Ryu, who's found naked in a sand ditch by allies Nina and Cray, and Fou-Lu, a recently-reawoken emperor looking to regain the throne he lost hundreds of years ago.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-fou-lu.jpg?itok=pFM54y93 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-fou-lu.jpg?itok=3tlLjr-m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll spend your time with both Ryu and Fou-Lu in&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise, the game is a fairly straightforward turn-based JRPG, although it's got some tricks up its sleeve that make it stand out in what was a pretty crowded market at the time.</p>

<p><em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>. Here's hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire III&nbsp;</em>release sometime soon, as unlikely as that might be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/doom-the-dark-ages-cosmic-realm-reveal-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Here are the latest details, via id Software game director Hugo Martin on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/25/revealing-cosmic-realm-gameplay-from-doom-the-dark-ages-out-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><div><p>If you’ve been following along, you already know that <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> is a premium single-player campaign featuring three core pillars of engagement: story, combat, and exploration. I’m guessing you’re reading this because you want to hear something new, something about the game no one else has heard about. Well, I’ve got a good one for you.</p><p>We think <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> is the best <em>DOOM</em> game we’ve ever made (but that’ll be for you to decide). We gave this everything we had, left no feature unpolished: we have 22 levels of incredible first-person shooter single-player combat; tons of gameplay innovations like the Shield Saw, flail, and new crazy guns; and an awesome roller coaster ride of an <a title="Genres > Action [2,697 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> story to carry you through to the finish.</p><p>AND—we have huge worlds for you to explore.</p><p>One of them is totally unique for a <em>DOOM</em> game, a space we’ve never been to but a world we’ve wanted to incorporate into the <em>DOOM</em> universe for a while: the Cosmic Realm. You will bear witness to the cyclopean architecture of this Lovecraftian dimension as you explore its darkest secrets and battle its most insane enemies.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>An unholy union between Hell and the Cosmic Realm has been formed. You’re going to have to experience the story to find out why—but this partnership has given birth to a new host of adversaries for the Slayer to confront.</p><p>Enemies like the Cosmic Baron. A twin-bladed brute, he attacks with relentless pressure, and at range he releases a flurry of psionic attacks that can block your projectiles and rip through your precious health. But fear not, because embedded in his attacks are parry windows that a skilled Doom Slayer should be able to exploit, should he or she be brave enough to stand and fight him.</p><p>All the strongest foes in <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> require this kind of aggression. You’ll weave your way through a maze of projectiles, just like in classic Doom, to then go toe-to-toe with the biggest demons we’ve ever created.</p><p>After you’ve dispatched the Cosmic Baron, be careful, because rising above the dark horizon you’ll find the powerful Cacodemon, a hybrid between the two dimensions and newly designed for this game. This floating mass of telepathic terror will immobilize you with his advanced shield attacks and cripple you with his tentacle strikes, should you allow him to get close.</p><p>But—you can counter these enemies’ assaults with a new weapon, an ancient tool from dimensions beyond our own: the Reaver Chainshot, a brutal ballistic iron mace of death.</p><p>Fire it quickly to unleash a light attack to a single foe, or hold down the trigger to charge its Chaos Sphere and unleash vicious long-range melee strikes, turning your enemies’ insides into demonic pulp. This weapon is unlike anything we’ve ever had in an id game; it brings the <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em>‘ fantastic melee combat to a whole new merciless level of bone-breaking destruction. The sound, the design, the visuals, this weapon is amazing and you’re gonna love using it in battle.</p><p>There are so many more secrets to reveal and legends to forge here in this new world we’ve crafted for you. I think you’ll find your time in the Cosmic Realm to be full of intrigue and bloody, bone-crunching mayhem. And it will look amazing on your PlayStation 5, featuring cutting-edge, ludicrous mode graphics powered by the all-new idTech 8.</p><p>The innovations in this latest version of idTech allow us to have more content visible on-screen than ever before—bigger spaces with longer views; more enemies to fight; more destruction; better feedback; a better overall gaming experience. We have fully dynamic lighting powered through raytracing, which has allowed us to iterate faster during development and empowered our team to make better art more efficiently. idTech 8 is a purpose-built engine with performance that’s buttery-smooth at 60 frames per second on <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,454 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>—this game will play every bit as good as it looks.</p><p>And there’s plenty more to talk about, but we wanted to give Sony fans something special as we head into launch. We cannot wait to share this experience with you. It is the biggest and most complete, epic game we have ever made at id and it plays fantastic on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro. There will be more to explore, weapons and abilities to unlock, and demons to crush in <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> when it releases.</p></div><p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/doom-the-dark-ages/9ph9x0760b0t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a> on May 15.

                <p dir="ltr">The TSA is well-known for its sometimes-questionable decision-making when it comes to what can and cannot fly. This week, one Call Of Duty fan found out the hard way that replica bombs are one of the many items that cannot be brought onto an aircraft… even if said replica looks more like a monkey than a bomb.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent post on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1202998281489873&amp;id=100053391368777&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=5WvynoW1waY8WxDT#">the official Transport Security Administration Facebook page</a>, the TSA revealed it had confiscated a replica <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_Bomb" rel="nofollow ">Monkey Bomb</a> from a passenger at Boston Logan International Airport. The item in question is, of course, not a real bomb, but a replica of the amusing monkey-based grenade featured in a number of Call Of Duty titles, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4482806-tsa.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482806" data-ratio="1.242209631728" data-width="706" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4482806-tsa.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482806"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4482806-tsa.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"On today's episode of #ProhibitedItemsWeek, we present Call of Duty: Baggage Ops," the TSA shared on Facebook. "Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag. This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p><p dir="ltr">The replica in question appears to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Guys-Activision-Controller-xbox-one/dp/B08751LKZT" rel="nofollow ">Cable Guys Call Of Duty Monkey Accessory Holder</a>, which is meant to hold phones, console controllers, and other electronic accessories. But with three sticks of (clearly fake) C4 strapped to its back, the item apparently still counts as a "replica explosive," and is thus banned from both carry-on luggage <em>and</em> checked baggage. Anyone who wants to travel with their monkey-based replica explosive (and all other replica weapons) will have to mail those items to their final destination.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, it's not yet clear who the confiscated Monkey Bomb replica belongs to, but they're likely to be disappointed (and more than a little confused) when they arrive at their destination only to find that their beloved exploding monkey replica is mysteriously absent from their checked bag. (Interestingly, one <em>can</em> <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/transporting-firearms-and-ammunition" rel="nofollow ">travel with a real gun in their carry-on bag</a>, as long as they prepare the required paperwork.)</p><p>Alas, this is far from the strangest thing the Transport Security Administration has confiscated from passenger luggage. According to the TSA, <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/peanut-butter" rel="nofollow ">peanut butter is technically a liquid</a>, and the agency frequently posts odd (and amusing) prohibited item finds on its <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tsa/" rel="nofollow ">Instagram page</a> as well as its Facebook page.</p>

      <div><p>Capcom has announced a new sales milestone for flagship survival horror games&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, as well as new figures for several other games in the series.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1915685807085805921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>has hit ten million sales, which means the game has managed to pick up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">between January and now</a>.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil Village</em>, meanwhile, has crossed the eleven million mark. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million line</a> in June last year, so it's taking a little longer to pass those milestones than&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, but that's still a pretty impressive performance nonetheless. Capcom also shared this cool artwork to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=gUj5eoPl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=a3LFXN3V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games have reached big new sales milestones.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these two figures, Capcom also announced new milestones for&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, although it's harder to tell whether these are sales figures or player counts, given that both games are available via Xbox Game Pass right now.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil 7&nbsp;</em>has also passed the 15 million mark according to Capcom, but again, since that game has historically been available as part of Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, it's hard to say whether the figure refers to sales or simply player count.</p>

<p>In any case, the figures show that Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>franchise is still going strong, so hopefully, it won't be too long until the next installment of the franchise is revealed.</p>

<p>Roughly five years passed between the release of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 6&nbsp;</em>and the semi-reboot&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>, and a further four years went by until&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>arrived, so by that logic, we should be getting fairly close to a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>reveal, at the very least.</p>

    <p><span>Run an amusement park in Fontaine.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Paralogism,” will launch on May 7, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [192 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-961236"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update features a new Archon Quest Interlude chapter, leading players to Mondstadt where an unexpected storm brews. Meanwhile, a new amusement park opens its doors in Fontaine, challenging players to manage its operations with both wisdom and courage. Two new characters will also join the adventure: Escoffier, the former chef of Hotel Debord who can whip up delicious dishes with ease, and Ifa, a seasoned sauro-vet who fights alongside his saurian companion, Cacucu.</p><p>In the latest Archon Quest Interlude, players’ joyous return to Mondstadt during the Windblume Festival takes a sharp turn for the worse as an unexpected trial places Albedo in the crosshairs of all. Travelers will find themselves thrown into an investigation and more alongside Venti, familiar faces from the Knights of Favonius, new allies like Dahlia, as well as the Hexenzirkel’s very own Lady Alice.</p><p>As danger looms beyond the courtroom, signs of a greater threat begin to emerge with monsters invading the city. In a key negotiation with Lady Alice, Travelers must undergo a magical trial to secure her support and defend Mondstadt from the encroaching darkness. The mage’s trial arrives as a new Weekly Boss Challenge, unfolding in a dramatic battle upon a mystical chessboard. Face the King and Queen, uncover the secrets of the board, and prevail against this onslaught of powerful foes!</p><p>A brand-new management gameplay event is coming to Fontaine: The Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland, starring Navia alongside familiar faces from Fontaine and Natlan as you work together to run an amusement park. Through managing three main attractions—Eclectic Escapades, Movie Masterpieces, and Mellow Manor—players can grow their park by upgrading facilities and improving Service Value by recruiting and training employees. Along the way, helpful “Friendly Encounters” and even a local chef may offer valuable management techniques or buffs. Clever use of Action Points during each business cycle is key to maximizing revenue and unlocking Performance Rewards, including the exclusive 4-star bow, Sequence of Solitude.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>But Fontaine is home to more surprises yet! Players will soon cross paths with Escoffier, a new 5-star Cryo polearm wielder and the former head chef of the famous Hotel Debord. Her combat style blends culinary flair with elemental power. Escoffier’s Elemental Skill allows her to summon the All-Spectrum Multi-Use <a title="Genres > Cooking [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">Cooking</a> Mek, which can either stay in place to absorb Elemental Attacks and prepare food items, or follow the active character to serve up continuous blasts of Cryo DMG. Beyond dishing out damage, Escoffier also brings reliable support to the table. Her Elemental Burst heals allies, and both her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst reduce enemies’ Hydro and Cryo RES, an effect that strengthens with more Hydro or Cryo teammates.</p><p>Another new playable character is a familiar face from Natlan: Ifa, a new 4-star Anemo catalyst user from the Flower-Feather Clan who soars into battle with his Qucusaurus companion, Cacucu. This skilled sauro-vet can rain Tonicshots on his foes while healing teammates, and summon a wind current that pulls in enemies to control the battlefield. While in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, Ifa boosts Swirl and Electro-Charged DMG based on the party’s Nightsoul Points. With his sharp medical instincts, Ifa can also automatically heal the active character when their HP falls below a certain threshold, ensuring his team stays healthy and strong in the heat of battle.</p><p>In Version 5.6’s Event Wishes, Escoffier, Navia, and Ifa will be part of the first phase, followed by Kinich and Raiden Shogun in the latter. Meanwhile, this version will bring back the Chronicled Wish, this time featuring various 5-star characters from Inazuma.</p><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> Version 5.6 will lead to another chapter of the main story, and let players run an amusement park starting from May 7. </p></blockquote><div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

                <p>Hideo Kojima has revealed a new piece of trivia about his PlayStation game Death Stranding. He said on a social media post that he offered Margaret Qualley a role in the video game after seeing her in a Kenzo perfume ad back in 2016.</p><p>The ad was directed by Oscar-winning director Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Her), and in it, Qualley dances in a variety of contorting positions. "The only note I got from my agent was that they wanted me to dance like a tree," <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/05/how-margaret-qualley-auditioned-for-spike-jonzes-kenzo-ad.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Qualley said of the ad</a>, which you can see below.</p><p>In Death Stranding, Qualley plays Mama and Lockne. It's unclear if Qualley is coming back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. </a></p><p>Qualley's stardom has grown since 2019's Death Stranding, as she played one of the leads in the Oscar-nominated movie The Substance in 2024. She's also known for her roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the TV series Maid. Among her numerous upcoming projects is Happy Gilmore 2.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 launches at the end of June on PS5, with Kojima directing. Lately, Kojima has been busy <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1915711243488285041" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing the game ahead of release</a>. Kojima Productions recently held a media event where members of the press got a chance to play it, and impressions will be posted online this May. </p>

The developer behind acclaimed indie role-player Tenderfoot Tactics has removed the game from sale on Xbox, and said the decision was made to support a growing Palestinian-lead boycott of Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
"We have removed Tenderfoot Tactics from sale on Xbox in solidarity with BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonofbadru.bsky.social/post/3lngim3mjzc2x">Tenderfoot Tactics developer Badru wrote on social media</a>. "We call on others in our community to do whatever they can to fight this historic injustice. Free Palestine."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, the Palestinian BDS National Committee added Microsoft to its list of companies flagged as having links to the Israeli military. In Microsoft's case, <a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox">the BDS Movement states</a> that the maker of Windows and Xbox has provided Azure cloud and AI services "central to accelerating Israel's genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip". Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment.
</p>
<p>
The BDS Movement has subsequently issued a call for a boycott of Microsoft products, including Xbox specifically, as a visible way to pressure the company. Its website suggests cancelling your Xbox Game Pass subscription, and avoiding key Microsoft-owned franchises such as Minecraft, Call of Duty and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>.
</p>
<p>
"By boycotting the Xbox brand, we're pressuring Microsoft to end its complicity in Israel's genocide, occupation and apartheid against Palestinians," the BDS Movement states. "Palestinians call on everyone to boycott Microsoft's Xbox and Microsoft gaming products since viable gaming alternatives exist. Genocide is not a game."
</p>
<p>
Other companies listed by the BDS to be boycotted include computer manufacturer HP, and Reebok, which sponsors the Israel Football Association.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-protest-employees-fired-israel-gaza-50th-anniversary-c5b3715fa1800450b8d0f639b492495e">AP reported earlier this month</a> that Microsoft had swiftly fired two employees who interrupted a presentation on AI held during the company's 50th anniversary celebration to protest links to Israel.

At the time, Nintendo shared pre-orders would be happening the following week, but it had to pause those plans in the face of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">Trump's ambiguous tariff plans</a>. After some time, however, Nintendo made public that pre-orders would begin today, April 24, and that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-demand-outpaces-nintendos-expectations-and-supply">demand was already exceeding supply</a>.</p>

<p>Which lead to last night, at 12 p.m. ET, when pre-orders at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy officially opened. Many of us here on staff were at the ready, credit cards in hands, to secure our consoles. Some of us were successful. Some of us were not, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lnknfbsobs2f">some of us fell asleep</a>.</p>

<p>But what about you? Were you able to pre-order a Switch 2? Did you not even bother trying? Are you perfectly happy with your Steam Deck and have no plans to get a Switch 2? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

Raiders of Blackveil is said to combine elements from MOBAs, RPGs, and PvE extraction titles to deliver a strategic action game that can be played solo or cooperatively with up to two friends.</p>

<p>In Raiders of Blackveil, you fight through a dystopian future in which a mega-corporation, Blackveil, oppresses the industrial-fantasy world's animals. Players join the animal rebellion working to take down the company and preserve a future free from enslavement and mindless consumerism.</p>

</article><p>The Copenhagen-based studio has been developing Raiders of Blackveil in secret for the past two years with developers who have worked on series like Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Just Cause, and Kane &amp; Lynch on the team.&nbsp;Flösser, who is CEO of Wombo Games, served as chief creative officer at Square Enix during development of games like Hitman's first season, Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days, Deux Ex: Human Revolution, and Thief. He also worked on Hitman: Absolution, Hitman: Blood Money, Freedom Fighters, and more in managerial roles.</p>

<p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finaly be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,"&nbsp;Flösser said in a press release. "Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in Early Access later this year."</p>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is scheduled to launch into Early Access this coming summer.</p>

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has stated its upcoming reboot won't have an offline mode.</p>
<p>This is because "the game and city [known as San Vansterdam] are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox", and both are "always online and always evolving".</p>

</figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">recent column by the developer</a>, Skate players will notice changes to San Vansterdam itself as time goes on, as well as "smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities". And, so the studio can deliver on its vision, Skate will "always require a live connection".</p>
<p>Full Circle says this may not be a surprise to anyone who has been part of Skate's playtest, but it may still be a surprise to those who haven't been partaking. After all, the original games were offline. Then again, the Skate revival will be a free-to-play title on its release, so perhaps some were already expecting an online connection as standard.</p>
<p>In addition to chatting about the lack of an offline mode, the Skate team also addressed the playtest's microtransactions. As reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">microtransactions were added during the game's closed alpha test</a>.</p>
<p>"We know that using real money during a playtest is a little unusual, but we think it’s the best way to properly assess and adjust the system before launch," Full Circle said today.</p>
<p>"If you see prices or other things changing over time, please understand that this is normal. And of course, you will receive the amount you spent during playtesting in San Van Bucks (SVB) when we reset for Early Access launch."</p>
<p>As to when we will all be able to get our hands on Skate, Full Circle remains committed to its 2025 early access release window, although it hasn't shared a more specific date as yet.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>.

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS support for the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to be a massive game-changer for the upcoming system, as the AI upscaler is already delivering impressive results upscaling low base resolutions to 1080p.</p>
<p>In a recent hands-on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> going over the system and both first and third-party games, the tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to try out the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Street Fighter 6, among other games. The game is the first taste of a game powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine on the system, and it seems like it delivers on all fronts, sporting stable 60 FPS gameplay in docked mode with some visual cutbacks in line with those featured in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox Series S versions over the others. More interesting, however, is that the game is not running at native 1080p resolution as early analysis of the available footage suggested, but at 1080p resolution upscaled from base 540p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS. Given how clean the image looks, this is extremely impressive.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter 6 Nintendo Switch 2 port is not the only impressive third-party port that will launch with the system in a little over two months. Much like the CAPCOM game, Cyberpunk 2077 has also been<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> confirmed</a> to use a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. The upscaler is reportedly used for all the game's display modes in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">exceptions</a>. You can learn more about the new system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">report.</a></p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 launches on April 29th, which is also when the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date" rel="nofollow">long-awaited Steam release</a> will happen. It's not clear whether the game will support crossplay between platforms, however.</p>

<p>Co-op supports two players, and you can "explore the entirety of Miraland, including the brand new Sea of Stars area" with a friend in tow. You can also teleport to your fellow Stylist, take photos, and "enjoy all-new interactions" as part of the co-op mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=cSr3pbrQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=s93mLdeC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 brings a new co-op mode and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Version 1.5 is also known as "Bubble Season", the update is also introducing new bubble-themed co-op challenges to take on.</p>

<p>These will involve teaming up to "use bubble props that generate bubbles in different colors to reveal hidden paths", as well as "protecting a fragile bubble as it travels along a winding path" and working with your co-op partner to keep it safe.</p>

<p>You'll also find lots of new stuff on Serenity Island, which has transformed into "a fantastical playground brimming with floating bubbles and celebration". There, you can ride a Bubble Gondola, use a new outfit to "create soaring water columns for traversal", and more.</p>

<p>Of course, this being an&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new outfits, including two new five-star sets and five free outfits, one of which is "legendary fan-favorite" Sea of Stars. The new dyeing system will also let you change outfits' individual colors and create custom color schemes.</p>

And he’s put it to good use in his 20-plus year career, playing everything from a flying ball of fire in <em>Fantastic Four</em> to a fireman-turned-revolutionary running through fire in <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, with a bunch more ass kicking in between. So, when he pulled off playing twin vampire and savior in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sinners-post-credit-scenes-1851777646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sinners-post-credit-scenes-1851777646"><em>Sinners</em></a></span>, it wasn’t surprising when the biceps came out, the bullets started flying, and undead punches were swinging. That’s just what Michael B Jordan does.</p><p>As we all collectively bask in Jordan’s Oscar-worthy performance in the year’s best film, it’s appropriate to look back at the most physically badass roles in his career.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-recommend-id="image://ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="422" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-recommend-id="image://ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="422" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s almost nothing redeemable about <em>Fantastic Four</em>—except for the fact that Michael B. Jordan somehow turned a flaming CGI mess into a showcase of raw, physical swagger. As Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch, Jordan isn’t just tossing fireballs or flying through collapsing debris; he’s <em>owning</em> every chaotic second with the kind of athletic command usually reserved for action heroes in better movies. Between landing with thunderous force after mid-air combustion and confidently walking out of infernos like it’s just another Tuesday, Jordan makes you believe that setting yourself on fire might actually be cool if you’ve got the abs for it. The movie might crash and burn, but MBJ rises from it like a fireproof phoenix—cocky, kinetic, and built for the heat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-recommend-id="image://049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-format="webp" data-width="803" data-height="436" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-recommend-id="image://049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-format="webp" data-width="803" data-height="436" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Running through fire, smashing through walls, and igniting more than just books, Michael B. Jordan’s turn as Guy Montag in <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> is a slow-burn kind of badass. You don’t expect a dystopian fireman-turned-revolutionary to be this physically commanding, but Jordan makes rebellion look like a contact sport. Whether he’s barreling through surveillance drones, sprinting across flaming streets, or wrestling with his own morality as violently as he does his enemies, his body moves like a weapon sharpened by rage and purpose. It’s not the kind of superheroic muscle-flexing you see in <em>Creed</em> or <em>Black Panther</em>, but it’s every bit as intense—just cloaked in ash, smoke, and the weight of dismantling a broken system.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-recommend-id="image://a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="630" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-recommend-id="image://a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="630" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You don’t usually think of a fighter pilot role as a physical showcase, but Michael B. Jordan made sure his turn as Maurice “Bumps” Wilson in <em>Red Tails</em> hit different. Right out the gate, he’s throwing hands in the barracks, turning a playful scuffle into a display of fast fists and sharp footwork that shows he’s got more than just pilot skills. Once he’s in the air, that energy doesn’t let up. He’s yanking the controls like he’s in a street brawl with gravity, barking into the radio while dodging enemy fire, and pulling G-forces like it’s personal. In one brutal dogfight, Bumps takes a hit and nearly blacks out—but Jordan grits through it, clutching the stick like it’s life or death, sweat pouring and muscles flexed. Even when he’s grounded, he’s all tension and twitchy readiness—pacing, punching the air, never still. Jordan was a fighter in every sense of the word.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-recommend-id="image://6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Televsion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-recommend-id="image://6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a moment in <em>Friday Night Lights</em> where Vince Howard takes off on a broken play, jukes two defenders out of their cleats, stiff-arms a third into the turf, and dives headfirst into the end zone like it’s life or death—and in Howard’s world, it kind of is. It’s in scenes like that where Michael B. Jordan’s physicality erupts. As one of his few true sports roles, Howard captures the raw athleticism Jordan brought to <em>Friday Night Lights.</em> It wasn’t just football; it was survival dressed in pads. And Jordan made sure you felt every yard he earned.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-recommend-id="image://9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-recommend-id="image://9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jordan’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-killmonger-card-battler-zoo-deck-pool-2-1849813798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-killmonger-card-battler-zoo-deck-pool-2-1849813798">Killmonger</a></span> yelling “Is this your king?” is forever embedded in the collective consciousness of everyone who’s seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-marvel-mcu-1851695772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-marvel-mcu-1851695772"><em>Black Panther</em></a></span>, because it’s a declaration of dominance he backs up with every ounce of muscle and menace in his performance. From the moment he enters Wakanda, he moves like a man who’s trained for war his entire life—because he has. Every strike is calculated, every fight brutal, whether he’s dismantling T’Challa in ritual combat or walking through Wakanda’s royal court with the swagger of someone who’s already won. Coogler expertly weaponizes Jordan’s physique, making every flex and clash of spears feel like a reckoning. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a9f3ef16ee64e2098c5a8285381e7ccf" data-recommend-id="image://a9f3ef16ee64e2098c5a8285381e7ccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1250" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adonis Creed staring " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adonis Creed staring " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Across three films, he doesn’t just play a boxer—he <em>is</em> one, chiseled out of grief, grit, and legacy. Whether he’s hammering tires in back-alley training montages or trading blows with human tanks in the ring, Jordan’s body looks war-ready. And under Ryan Coogler’s direction, every punch, flex, and sweat-drenched stare tells you this isn’t just about titles—it’s about identity, redemption, and proving he’s more than Apollo’s son. This is Jordan at his most locked-in, most lethal, and most legendary. Putting on a performance worthy of being attached to the <em>Rocky</em> legacy is one of the highest honors any badass actor can receive.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e342966a109a8121349fba8493e12fed" data-recommend-id="image://e342966a109a8121349fba8493e12fed" data-format="jpg" data-width="2707" data-height="1353" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan shooting down Klansmen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan shooting down Klansmen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

As twin brothers  Elijah “Smoke” Moore and Elias “Stack” Moore in Ryan Coogler’s magnum opus horror flick <em>Sinners, </em>Jordan wasn’t only body slamming, shooting and leaping over waves of blood thirsty vampires, he was also taking bullet shots, rumbling, and trying to sink his teeth into...himself. Coogler made sure you could see his bulging biceps as he unloaded rounds of ammo onto racist Klansmen to reinforce the notion that Jordan’s characters were built to do battle with the evils of the world, because survival is the only way they’ve known how to live. Whether you see <em>Sinners</em> in the panoramic brilliance of IMAX 70mm or on your phone, you’ll recognize that Michael B Jordan is a badass regardless of the era.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

It’s an impressive, high value package, and for many it makes Nintendo’s Switch 2 game pricing look even worse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare and contrast, as many are doing, Oblivion Remastered to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, which costs $70, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which costs an eye-watering $80. There’s a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of the OG Switch versions, and Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can upgrade for free. But Nintendo’s standalone pricing here has sparked a backlash online, especially when you consider the jump to $80 not only for Tears of the Kingdom, but for a number of other Switch 2 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it gets worse for Zelda. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">IGN has confirmed that Breath of the Wild's Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not come with the Expansion Pass</a>, which means you have to pay an additional $20 to play the DLC on the Switch 2 if you don't already own it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild comes with improved visuals and performance, achievements, as well as support for the new "Zelda Notes" service in the Nintendo Switch Online app. If you already own Breath of the Wild on the Switch, you won't get those features automatically; you need to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition to gain access.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t own the game, you can buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild for $70, $10 more than the game initially retailed at (so basically the price of the original game and the pack). But it won't include the DLC Expansion Pack, so if you want access to that, it's another $20 on top of that. That makes $90 total for the full Breath of the Wild Nintendo Switch 2 experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whopping $90 for the most current version of a game that came out in 2017 on the Wii U <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo"><u>feels painful</u></a>, especially in light of Mario Kart World retailing at an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy"><u>unheard-of $80</u></a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 itself costing $450</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here we have Oblivion Remastered, which some are saying is good enough to be called a remake, with all the DLC thrown in for $50. You can see why Nintendo is coming out poorly in the wake of comparisons.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Oblivion, a full-blown Unreal Engine 5 remake is $50 and its also on Game Pass Ultimate</p><p>Zelda Breath of the Wild Switch 2 edition is $70 with a few enhancements...</p><p>I dont know how anybody can defend Nintendo for its Switch 2 game prices <a href="https://t.co/7d6VGSlBgc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7d6VGSlBgc</a></p></div>— JayWood2010 (@JayWood2010) <a href="https://twitter.com/JayWood2010/status/1914707600731431055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo will look at them and say ‘those guys could have made $30 extra,' " <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6rvcp/nitendo_can_learn_from_bethesda/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joked redditor Cultural_Writing2999</a>.
