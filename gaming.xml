            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undanuted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're going to work backward from the latest game, and the only one so far set outside of the World War II setting, <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>.</p>

<p>Although we haven't covered <em>Undaunted</em> on the site before, we have covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>

<p>In <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to work out how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-5.jpg?itok=YKVtEzN8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-5.jpg?itok=t6V0aXNu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most troops in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto&nbsp;</em>have multiple cards, representing the various troops or operators in a unit. In the image above we can see the 5 members of the huge LFA Centurion mech.</figcaption></figure><p>Introduced in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, which wasn't in the previous games, are maps with different elevations. These are handled extremely well, with tiles that are higher than others, but also with tiles that have bridges across. If an elevated element is on the same tile, then the units on the two different elements can't engage. But if you are shooting at an adjacent tile from an elevated position, then you change from using the standard 10-sided dice (D10) to 12-sided dice (D12), and if you are shooting at an elevated position, you drop to an 8-sided dice (D8). This mechanic simulates the advantages and disadvantages of shooting from and at elevated positions well, without making things too complicated.</p>

<p>Most of the game box is taken up with 4 large double-sided game boards, of which each has 1 of the 8 scenarios printed on them. The scenarios are designed to be played through in order, increasing in map size, force size, and complexity as you move through. But you are able to play any scenario you wish. The game can also be played cooperatively 2 v 2, with each player taking one of the listed groups, or solo for which there is a separate rulebook, with 8 scenarios, with rules for playing against both of the included forces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-3.jpg?itok=FX5pzJ3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-3.jpg?itok=1lPZ6XDn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The highground is king in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto.&nbsp;</em>In the image above, the Stalker would roll a normal D10 to hit the Nailgunner, but would roll the better D12 against the Ripper who's on a lower elevation, and the Ripper in turn would only roll a D8 against the Stalker.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Undaunted 2200 Callisto Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> has 2 playable forces. The&nbsp;Inter-Jovian Mining Union (IMU), known as the Breakers, who are the combined workers and unions, united against the corporation, the&nbsp;Lunar Frontier Authority (LFA), and their hired security staff. They used to work together in harmony, but poor conditions and a focus on profits over the workers and making the mining colony a reasonable place to live has led to strikes and riots, which the LFA are looking to quell.</p>

<p>The 2 forces do have slightly different playstyles. The LFA has fewer token troops and has 5 mechs that use card standee figures rather than tokens. The Breakers have more troops, and 2 vehicles, the Drill and Hauler. These slightly different forces gives the impression of the Breakers swarming the LFA, with the slightly less limited LFA troops having to support each other, especially the mechs. Both sides do feel balanced, but I would recommend giving any new players you're playing with the Breakers (unless the really want to be the LFA) as they're slightly easier to pilot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-6.jpg?itok=EryP76Ur 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-6.jpg?itok=oLCoO4XZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both the LFA and Breakers have a unique thematic feel based on their avialable action cards in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Blend Of Deck Building And Wargaming Feel In Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p>The blending works extremely well. The way damage works with removing cards, and the limited card draws each turn means there are always tactical choices to be made. You need to use a scout action before you can move into a square, so there is a chance you might get an awkward draw and not be able to move forward because you don't have a scout card, which can really hamper your mobility, especially if you're opponent really hammers down on your scouts, but it's not common, so doesn't break the game.</p>

<p>I love the damage mechanic (using your hand and deck as health is my favorite mechanic in any gaming system), but there doesn't feel like much agency to it, and I wish there was a choice of where you lost the card from, with different repercussions depending on where you lose if from. It can feel oppressive when your opponent hammers down on a unit and negates your turn because of a poor draw. Again, it doesn't happen often, but it can happen simply because of the deck mechanic. You are of course, able to do this to your opponent too, and that's what made it enjoyable for me. It's not a matter of taking out your opponent's best unit, you need to pick your targets and stop them from scoring objectives, along with limiting their movement and options.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-2.jpg?itok=kFKWyIud 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-2.jpg?itok=BA4uk-8R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto </em>comes with a rulebook, scenario book, and a combined rule and scenario book for solo play, that also details the enemy actions for the cards they draw.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p><i>Undaunted 2200 Callisto </i>is a very interesting blend of board, card, and wargame, which offers some great moments and some surprising narrative depth in the 8 scenarios it includes. It's not super deep, but you can feel the difference between the Breakers and the LFA, and over the campaign, you can really get behind their motives. Solo works well, although somewhat predictably as each of the enemy units has a fixed flowchart of actions it takes, which makes it feel more like a puzzle than a strategy wargame. The 4 player coop is fun and actually has a nice way of streamlining the draws with the smaller decks, rather than feeling restrictive with smaller forces. I really hope that we see an expansion to <em>Undaunted 2200</em>, either through another faction or 2, or more troops for the IMU and LFA. Even though the maps are fixed, they do offer a lot of replayability if more forces were to be added.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> has some interesting new elements for veteran <em>Undaunted</em> players, along with all the mechanics that you know and love, in a new setting. New players will find this version approachable if they're not behind the WWII theme of previous games. Wargamers might not like the randomness and control of the deck system, as it can feel extremely restrictive if you're coming from a purely wargaming background, and takes some getting used to. If you're looking for a super technologically advanced sci-fi setting, then <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> does feel like WWII in space, even though both forces do feel thematically unique (and not like 2 countries fighting), the weapons and equipment still feel very modern, and combat feels very close.</p>

                <p>Capcom released an absolute gem of a game this year. No, I'm not talking about Dragon's Dogma 2, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, or Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection--all of which hit shelves in 2024. And you didn't miss a stealth release in the Resident Evil, Street Fighter, or Monster Hunter series. Alongside three major well-received releases, Capcom released an off-beat game filled with ghosts, Japanese tradition, and strategic job assignment: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. This game was released in 2024, but it feels like it was sent forward from 2004--in all the best ways.</p><p>No one is going to blame you for having missed it. To say it flew under the radar is an understatement, and Capcom said in a recent financial briefing that the game did not meet sales targets. But Kunitsu-Gami should be treated as almost a historical document, both in the way the game is designed and in its actual content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414274"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg"></figure><p>As the warrior Soh, you have to protect the divine maiden Yoshiro so that she can purify the defiled mountain, freeing villagers to help you in a sort of worker-management real-time-strategy game that takes you in a zig-zag path down the mountain and through all manner of monsters and ghosts plucked from Japanese folklore.</p><p>The rhythm of the game is simple: By day, you'll rescue villagers, restore tower defense-style obstacles, and try to get Yoshiro as close to the gate as possible without bringing her so close that she becomes endangered. You'll also assign the villagers roles like Woodsman, Archer, Ascetic, Sumo, or one of many other classes. At night, you'll defend Yoshiro with the help of those villagers, managing the villagers to make them effective and keep them safe. Once you've stopped the monsters, everybody does a dance to purify the gate.</p><h3>Classic Design</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414275"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg"></figure><p>Many games these days are designed to appeal to as many people as possible and provide dozens or even hundreds of hours of gameplay, often advertising piles of DLC and in-game currency that costs real-world money. Kunitsu-Gami feels silent by comparison. There's one piece of DLC, and it's free even for the Game Pass players--some simple Okami-themed cosmetics, such as a charm that causes grass to grow behind you when you walk, that both looks like something straight out of the 2006 Capcom classic and that feels of a piece with the look of Kunitsu-Gami. There's nothing extra to buy, unless you count the soundtrack, which is available on Steam.</p><p>The game itself is linear, giving you an increasingly difficult playlist of stages and a growing stable of character classes to assign. You can go back and replay levels for additional rewards, but they're optional. The game is challenging, but it never asks you to fiddle around with collecting knick-knacks, clearing towers, or whatever else. It's just a strategy game, and that alone makes it somewhat harder to approach. It isn't a variation on a well-trodden set of gameplay mechanics and themes. Kunitsu-Gami asks the player to learn a new set of systems as they manage their villagers and resources, and to do that in a world of folklore that will be entirely new to many Western players.</p><p>The whole game feels like it was somehow delayed by 20 years and only just came out now, but that's not a dig on it--the opposite, in fact. Publishers similar in size to Capcom just don't make games like this anymore.</p><h3>Traditional Art</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg"></figure><p>Beyond feeling like a welcome trip to the gaming of days past, Kunitsu-Gami aesthetic looks backward as well, but into Japanese folklore and tradition. Many games reflect the place in which it was made, but Kunitsu-Gami takes this to another level. Kunitsu-Gami is steeped in Japanese art.</p><p>The movements of Soh, Yoshiro, and the villagers are pulled from Kagura ritual dance, including Soh's sword combat moves. You can find woodblock prints telling you about the different monsters you fight. The designs of the monsters themselves mimic traditional art of yokai (ghosts) and bakemono (monsters) in Japanese woodblock art. Where games like Nioh and Ghost of Tsushima are interested in immersing you in their worlds and making you feel like you're the guy having the adventure (a totally valid approach!), Kunitsu-Gami presents a world that feels like a diorama of a fairytale. Photorealism is the last thing on its mind.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-atP9Csjhw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B-atP9Csjhw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The music, too, finds inspiration in traditional children's songs and rhymes, and uses a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and modern Western instruments to create a fusion of sounds that feels historical without being limiting. You can present Yoshiro with traditional Japanese confections made by real confectioners. The team behind the game took those confections and scanned them into the game in extreme detail to capture the look and feel of the food. Much of the architecture and clothing also comes from physically crafted objects, all created with an eye toward authenticity to the art itself. The game may be a digital creation, but the things that inspired it are historical and physical, and so the art in the game is, too.</p><p>Just making sense of Kunitsu-Gami from an artistic perspective is a tall order, and you could spend dozens of hours studying each element and still come back with questions. It's steeped in historical Japanese culture, with such attention to detail that it might as well qualify as a piece of Japanese historical preservation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414278"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg"></figure><p>Even the marketing for Kunitsu-Gami reaches back into Japanese history, as Capcom partnered with a Bunraku troupe for part of the game's advertising. Bunraku (puppet) theater is one of the oldest forms of performing art in Japan.</p><p>When I think about Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess as a physical game, I don't imagine a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X label on the box. In their place is a PlayStation 2 or 3 label, or maybe even a GameCube one, and I'm in my first apartment, playing it at midnight when I have class the next morning. Despite being a new game, Kunitsu-Gami is an artifact from another time in the best way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

<p>Alongside the countless story missions available—both in the single-player campaign and in Red Dead Online—the multiplayer mode features countless ways to earn decent money fast. You could, for instance, sift through treasure maps, take part in free roam events, earn money by completing daily challenges, take on the trader role, do delivery missions, and overall maximize efficiency to earn quick money to beat the vast majority of players economically.</p>



<h2 id="h-go-treasure-hunting"><strong>Go Treasure Hunting</strong></h2>



<p>If you’d rather not get your hands dirty as a lawless gunslinger in the Wild West or don’t feel like taking part in the often-lengthy story missions of Red Dead Online, then consider locating treasure maps and becoming a defacto treasure hunter instead!</p>



<p>You can earn treasure maps in several ways, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Leveling Up</strong> — Rockstar Games is kind enough to provide the occasional map when you level up. More specifically, every five levels. The maps are in the camp lockbox or at the local post office.</li>



<li><strong>Gang Hideout Challenges </strong>— If you finish off a gang hideout in Red Dead Online, you can earn a map by taking down the boss or via a lock box at the very end of the missions.</li>



<li><strong>Outlaw Passes </strong>— If you pay for one of the Outlaw Passes in Red Dead Online, you’ll occasionally receive maps via the Benefits page.</li>



<li><strong>Posted on Trees</strong> — While exploring the world in free roam, you may stumble upon treasure maps stuck to various trees. The tree in question will appear illuminated, and you can snag the map and find the treasure chests for yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Treasure Hunters</strong> — Scattered about the world of Red Dead Online, you’ll stumble upon other treasure hunters. These NPCs are out there earning money, sometimes very good money, and they’ll sell you a map for a few dollars. Or, you could take it at gunpoint! After all, the in-game economy works at the end of a barrel sometimes.</li>
</ul>



<p>While perhaps not the fastest way to earn money in Red Dead Online, becoming a treasure hunter can be fantastic fun, especially from a role-play perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-become-a-bounty-hunter"><strong>Become a Bounty Hunter</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most lucrative and enjoyable ways to make money in Red Dead Online is by tackling the bounty hunter role. You can earn decent money in Red Dead Online by taking on bounty-hunting missions posted throughout the massive game world. You’ll track down targets and can even earn weekly bonuses to earn the most money.</p>



<p>It’s simple! Alongside tracking down bounties, including legendary bounties, you can earn higher rewards by looting fallen enemies to make more money faster. Then, you can buy something powerful, like a bolt action rifle. With the said rifle, you can snipe your bounty and their bodyguards from afar before moving in to loot.</p>



<p>Speaking of legendary bounties, numerous story missions are associated with the bounty hunter role in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>But first, you’ll have to pick up the Bounty Hunter License in Rhodes. The usual cost for the role is 15 Gold Bars, though various promotions may discount the total price in Red Dead Online. Then, you can tackle bounty-hunting missions from various Bounty Posters scattered about the game world, all of which will earn you money, gold, and experience.</p>



<p>Then, if you want to acquire the Prestigious Bounty Hunter License to tackle new ranks and acquire high-level items, and new skills, you’ll have to pay 30 Gold Bars. This license will also unlock Infamous Bounty Targets, which prove more lucrative overall.</p>







<h2 id="h-loot-gang-hideouts"><strong>Loot Gang Hideouts</strong></h2>



<p>There are various rewards for completing gang hideout missions in Red Dead Redemption 2, especially if your goal is to earn huge amounts of cash. Most hideouts are completely manageable solo, meaning you can earn money through bounty hunting, then buy a few powerful weapons and clear hideouts with ease.</p>



<p>Once all is said and done, you can scoop up the cash from the fallen bodies and perhaps even complete a few daily challenges for taking down foes along the way.</p>



<p>What’s the best way to take down a hideout, you ask? Personally, I would recommend utilizing a strong weapon like the repeater. It offers an excellent range advantage along with a high rate of fire to take down numerous foes without putting yourself in harm’s way.</p>



<p>Furthermore, each time you complete a hideout, you’ll earn a treasure map from the camp’s leader. The treasure map will spawn either on the corpse of the fallen commander or via a nearby lockbox, which usually contains some cash, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-play-free-roam-events-and-missions"><strong>Play Free Roam Events and Missions</strong></h2>



<p>As a multiplayer open world, Red Dead Online features countless free-roam events, and the occasional story mission, to help players earn money fast. If making money is the end goal, then why not have fun along the way by taking part in, say, the Showdown Series or horse races event?</p>



<p>You can quick join free-roam events throughout the game to earn money fast in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player to Red Dead Online, then the Rockstar-hosted events can be quite lucrative. These often weekly events usually offer double money and gold for Free Roam Events, with rewards handed out for completing specific challenges.</p>



<p>If you play online in a party, then tackling missions and events together is the easiest way to earn money quickly in Red Dead Online. It’s also a lot more enjoyable than tracking and killing NPCs to sell their meager inventories to the traders.</p>



<h2 id="h-take-on-a-player-role"><strong>Take On a Player Role</strong></h2>



<p>Along with the Bounty Hunter role is the Specialist Role, Naturalist Role, and Moonshiner Role. These unique in-game roles in Red Dead Online can help you earn a gold bar now and then, pick up raw materials to sell, acquire a fishing rod to catch lucrative trout and other wildlife, and gain a reasonable amount of cash in the game.</p>



<p>Of the three previously mentioned roles, the Moonshiner Role proves most effective at earning cash in-game. It does take some start-up, however, as you’ll have to complete a story mission or two, along with opening the business and acquiring supplies.</p>



<p>To make the best moonshine, you’ll have to pay upfront. Once you do, that little shack will begin to earn cash fast in Red Dead Online. Along with crafting moonshine, you’ll also take part in Bootlegger Missions, which will reduce the cost of production overall. But in doing so, you will contend with other players. Someone could easily grief your efforts. Or, you could pay out of pocket, though doing so will eat away at your profits.</p>



<p>Furthermore, invest in the upgrades! More potent moonshine will earn you more money per sale.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-return-of-dragons-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizkids-return-of-the-dragons-review-great-for-a-new-collector.1070427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-return-of-dragons-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's anything that I enjoy more than Dungeons… It's Dragons, so I was incredibly happy to hear that Wizkids was releasing a set of miniatures to represent the initial <em>D&amp;D 5E</em> adventure, <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> (aka <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen </em>and <em>Rise of Tiamat</em>). <em>Wizkids Dungeons &amp; Dragons Icons of the Realms Return of the Dragons</em> features a variety of minis that will help you bring your <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> campaign to life.</p>

<p>Much like other releases this collection is made up of a number of blind boxes, featuring a variety of minis relevant to the campaign alongside some much larger stand alone minis representing the different dragons that you'd face along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wizkids sent us eight of the blind boxes to take a look and try our chances at getting some cool minis, and cool minis we did receive. Included in this set the minis obtained ranged from stand-ins for player characters, minis for key faction members, a healthy number of dragons, and even some impressive Giant characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-more-monsters.jpg?itok=NVRe4oJp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-more-monsters.jpg?itok=X09LwDyk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the stranger minis we obtained</figcaption></figure><p>Inside each Blind Box you'll find 3-4 miniatures, normally one is a medium-sized mini while the others are smaller tucked in around the plastic frame.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Character</h2>

<p>From the blind boxes I obtained, I ended up with seven different generic enough characters that could become player characters. These were:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Barbarian (13/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gnome Wizard (1/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Halfling Bard (2/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hobgoblin Fighter (12/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orc Fighter (10/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orog Fighter (14/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Svirfneblin Fighter (4/44)</li>
</ul><p>While there was an interesting lead towards Fighters I was really impressed with the variety of species that was present. Players might not be familiar with an Orog (offspring of an Orc and Ogre) or might not know that Deep Gnome's proper title is Svirfneblin but it prompts players to take a playable race and see what tweaks they can make to make them more unique to the experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-player-characters.jpg?itok=y192VcW3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-player-characters.jpg?itok=Ra98pOHa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A nice assortment of minis to be any new player's first PC</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the melee characters wields an axe or sword, the wizard with their staff, and the Bard poses playing their violin ready to support the party with all kinds of magics and inspiration. While there are set names for each of these I could imagine just as easily the characters like the Hobgoblin being a Paladin, Rogue, or even a Ranger allowing it, and each of the others to fit into any table.</p>

<p>Of all of these, my favorite is the Orog, standing two heads over the Orc (even if more hunched) the comparison really allows you to understand how the Ogre blood would alter this creature. The blueish hue of its skin against its dark armor and axe makes it a very imposing figure.</p>

<h2>There Be Monsters In Them Boxes</h2>

<p>The offering of opponents for a party to fight against was also incredibly healthy. I got standard enemies – like Kobold (5/44), Bugbears (21/44), Needleblight (11/44), and a Wraith (23/44) – alongside some key members of different factions that play a larger role in the story. A Sun Elf Guard (9/44), Dragonclaw (20/44), Human Zhentarim Bandit (18/44), and a Red Wizard (34/44).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-monsters.jpg?itok=62OG_aRY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-monsters.jpg?itok=jh7nhG5j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fun fodder to throw at your party</figcaption></figure><p>Going through the blind box approach for the standard bad guys is a bit of a rough go. You'll get one or two Red Wizards, but when an encounter calls for 3, 4, or even 10 of them you're not going to want to be going to these blind boxes for the answer.</p>

<p>On top of those already mentioned other monsters that I got were the Quickling (3/44), Doppelganger (8/44), Mind Flayer (35/44), Manes (7/44), Guard Drake (22/44), and even a Ballista (19/44).</p>

<h2>Large And Up</h2>

<p>From the medium and larger monsters I received I was incredible happy. The Oni (25/44) and Pegasus (28/44) were unexpected to receive, but what I did get was a healthy amount of dragons.</p>

<p>Inside my eight blind boxes I received four different Dragons (kinda). I got the Young Blue Dragon (41/44), Young Green Dragon (31/44), Young Copper Dragon (32/44), and a Wyvern (29/44). If I was purchasing this expansion dragons of a variety would be what I was after and in that sense this expansion completely delivered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-the-dragons.jpg?itok=SCfQKSO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-the-dragons.jpg?itok=x_JnhSzO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even more fun to cause a low level TPK</figcaption></figure><p>On top of the range of dragons included I was most impressed by the range on their poses. The seated Copper and Green Dragons flare their brilliant wings out or keep them close respectively, while the Blue Dragon is in mid-flap allowing it to powerfully ascend.</p>

<p>Bigger than the dragons are the Hill Giant and Frost Giant (that come in two easily assembled pieces). With strange body proportions and unique armor styles both of these are incredibly eyecatching. While not as unique as some of the giants that came with the Bigby Presents collection these are going to get far more versatile use on the table.</p>

<h2>A Classic Assortment Of <em>D&amp;D</em> Minis</h2>

<p>Something that I loved so much about Tyranny of Dragons when I ran it was that it was a quintessential <em>D&amp;D</em> adventure. You have all kinds of hallmark monster encounters, dark cults, strange wizards, and a battle to stop the world being taken over by evil dragons. That same vibe is alive through the array of miniatures available in this blind box.</p>

<p>For a new DM wanting to start out their collection of higher quality minis there's a lot here that will be useful like the player characters of different races, different fodder enemies for along the way, and a few great setpiece monsters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-giants-and-beasts.jpg?itok=jw3zALYK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-giants-and-beasts.jpg?itok=Qk7FchBn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For when you want to shock them</figcaption></figure><p>As I said above you'll never have the consistency for a multi-monster encounter, but if you can even show your players what one Red Wizard looks like, while filling the rest of the ranks with a Bugbear or Bandit then it creates a more visually enticing experience.</p>

<h2><em>Wizkids Return of the Dragons</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Return of the Dragons</em>, much like the campaign it's based on, is a quintessential collection of minis that are incredibly versatile and appealing for any game you're going to be running. With a good collection of characters for players to take on, interesting yet frequently faced monsters adding repeated use, and dragons for your <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> game there's a lot here.</p>

<p>The major complaint that I have, with any blind box, is that it puts everything up to chance. For a campaign where there is a 10 Red Wizard encounter, or even one where you need 3 then you're going to have issues fielding the team.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-nintendo-switch-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-nintendo-switch-game.1070424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-nintendo-switch-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This time next year, we’ll hopefully be talking up a storm about the delights of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, how Nintendo has handled their own cross-gen transition and the games that have straddled the generations. With that in mind, 2024 has felt like Nintendo playing for time, leaning heavily on remakes and remasters once again – trawling the GameCube and 3DS libraries for inspiration – though with a clutch of new entries in beloved series that absolutely had the capacity to delight and surprise. Notably, the princesses got to step out of the shadow of Nintendo’s leading men and have adventures of their very own.</p>

<p>One of the longest-running jokes in video games came to a head this year as Zelda finally got to star in her own adventure, with Link having to play second fiddle for once. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> could so easily have been a character transplant with Zelda picking up sword, shield and boomerang just as Link would – and Zelda has been a badass warrior, pirate, ninja and more in the past – but as is often the case, Nintendo and developer Grezzo sought to do something a little bit different.</p>
<p>Leant the ability to summon objects and creatures, and attach to them in multiple ways, everything from simply navigating the world to fighting enemies becomes a magic-infused puzzle, lending this game its own distinctive tone and style. Sure, it does fall back on classic Link combat in short bursts, but for the most part you summoning blocks of water to swim through, attaching to a spider that will then clamber up a wall or over a tree for you, setting field alight with an arsonist Zol, or simply stacking beds in gravity-defying fashion to create a set of stairs.</p>
<p>It’s thoroughly enjoyable and a wonderful surprise that has us keen to see Zelda step into the limelight much more often in future.</p>

<h2>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island –&nbsp;Runner-up</h2>
<p>So many roguelikes and dungeon crawlers place an emphasis on build-crafting, and how the emergent gameplay experience can be dished out through satisfying skill combinations or optimized weapon upgrades. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-review/">Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island</a> is a delight because your build, and your optimized run, and your upgraded gear are all affected by the environment you find yourself in and the way the elements of the game-world naturally bounce off of each other.</p>
<p>Like the chemical reactions in Breath of the Wild that cause burning grass to create flight-enhancing wind gusts, there are layered systems in this game that crash together in consistently unexpected and hilarious ways. It’s an excellent twist on the usual number-crunching ethos of the modern roguelike, and perfect for a quick commute play-session on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h2>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s approach to remasters and remakes has been fairly scattershot on Nintendo Switch (outside of quickly porting across all the major Wii U games in the first few years of its replacement’s arrival), but as part of that, they’ve also struck a rich vein of 20-year-old games from the GameCube era.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> transplants what is widely considered to be the very best Paper Mario game into a modern game engine, giving it a buff and polish to help it stand up alongside more modern titles on the system, and in doing so gives us a perfect reminder of why Mario RPGs are so beloved, with all the quirkiness and charm of the story and character alongside the original Paper Mario combat style.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24317154/nintendo-switch-best-games-2024-top-10-goty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>This holiday season is the swan song for the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo told us as much when it said a long-awaited Switch successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">would be announced by April 2025</a>. But Nintendo thankfully didn’t get a case of senioritis as it looks to graduate to a Switch sequel, as 2024 had a litany of excellent titles come to the nearly eight-year-old console. So we’re taking a little look back at some of our favorite games on the Switch for 2024. One of the great things about this year’s offering of Switch titles is that they all should work on the follow-up to the Switch — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">since Nintendo confirmed its next generation will be backward-compatible</a>. (And hopefully any performance issues of games on the current Switch will be resolved when playing them on the next model, if we’re so lucky.)</p><p>We all have to remain patient as we continue to wait for the Switch’s successor, but these games are without a doubt worthy of playing during your current Nintendo console’s final months in the limelight.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a></h3></p><p>I know there are a handful of us on staff for which <em>Balatro</em> was our personal Game of the Year, and I don’t think any of us are gamblers or big fans of poker. That’s the beauty of this indie roguelike; you don’t have to be a stan of card games or know a thing about poker to enjoy its unique dopamine rush. From the music and sound effects to the lo-fi visuals, <em>Balatro</em> hits all the right notes to sink in its hooks and lock you in. You’re likely to find yourself muttering “just one more run” many times over. Next thing you know, it’s 3AM and the baby will be up in just a few hours — or perhaps that last part is just me.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24258654/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-edit-dungeons-links-awakening"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a></h3></p><p>Princess Zelda finally got her own game, allowing you to play as her full time in a Legend of<em> </em>actual Zelda. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">may not be perfect in its execution</a>, but it’s a worthwhile adventure where Zelda solves puzzles and defeats baddies by summoning previously defeated enemies and everyday objects.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey"><em>Animal Well</em></a></h3></p><p>There’s an air of mystery about <em>Animal Well</em> that may <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">entice you</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode">straight-up confuse you</a>. If you’re the type that loves forgoing any guides and figuring everything out on your own, there’s a really good chance you’ll love this pixelated 2D platformer. It blends a bit of <em>Mario</em>-like jumping puzzles with a Metroidvania sense of open exploration and adventure — complete with some mysterioso vibes.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Fellow Traveller Games</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173629/12-new-indie-games-play-right-now#:~:text=Hit%20%26%20Run%3F-,1000xResist%3A,-Many%20critics%20have"><em>1000xResist</em></a></h3></p><p><em>1000xResist</em> takes place in a postapocalyptic world where humanity is driven underground by the arrival of an alien race. You play Watcher, one of many clones of a young girl who is somehow immune to the mass disease brought by the alien Occupants. And of course, all is not what it seems. It’s capital-S, capital-F sci-fi for sure.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a></h3></p><p>It’s been a big year-plus for <em>Mario</em> RPGs. But after the remake of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23960646/super-mario-rpg-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario RPG</em></a> and the remaster of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>shows us that our favorite plumbing duo can still keep things fresh in the roleplaying space. <em>Brothership </em>has a lighthearted and playful story, fun turn-based combat, and an adorable art style. You can sum up how charming this game is with a singular, two-worded game mechanic: Luigi Logic.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver"><em>Neva</em></a></h3></p><p>Be prepared to feel feelings. <em>Neva</em> is the most recent indie from the developer of<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em></a>, and in addition to being a lovely work of visual art, it tells a story about caring for a baby fox that’s sure to make some folks weep (especially if you’re a parent).</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/marvel-vs-capcom-fc/en-us/"><em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em></a></h3></p><p>“I wanna take you for a ride.” And what a ride this classic fighting game collection is, encapsulating the various Marvel and Capcom crossover 2D fighters and even including <em>The Punisher </em>beat-’em-up that kick-started the long-running collaboration. This best-of compilation is worth the price of admission just to finally get <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em> on modern consoles, complete with online play.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> was the earliest gem of 2024, coming out way back in January. Fast-forward to October, and Ubisoft sadly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277630/ubisoft-ends-future-development-on-its-best-game-in-years">disbanded its development team</a>. But <em>The Lost Crown</em> remains an amazing side-scrolling Metroidvania / Soulslike mash-up with some challenging (yet fun as hell) combat and platforming. And while the game world is quite large, with lots to explore, the game respects the player’s time by offering helpful in-game tools — like pinning screenshots to the map.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24131275/pepper-grinder-review-devolver-digital-pc"><em>Pepper Grinder</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Pepper Grinder </em>is a unique 2D platformer that has you traverse its colorful sprite-filled world with a drill, dolphin-diving into and up from the ground. The game’s key mechanic feels frenetic and extremely rewarding when you expertly traverse the world’s obstacles via the violent path of your drill and fallen enemies. It then ups the ante later by adding a grappling hook. Be still my beating heart. (No, really, the fast action gets my heart rate up at times — in a fun way, not in a concerning way.)</p><div><p><cite>Image: Annapurna Interactive</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’ve ever enjoyed an escape room, you’re likely to dig <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. Its slick black, white, and red art style and eerie setting fill the game with a sense of mystery, and its challenging puzzles are sure to tickle your brain. Just be prepared to take notes, so as not to feel overwhelmed when the game makes you think outside the box — or do basic math.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What were the highs and lows, the disappointments that left us bereft and the surprises that reignited our love for games? And, importantly, how did Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo navigate this awkward period in which all of their consoles are several years old but not quite ready to be replaced just yet? (Nintendo’s Switch successor is coming soon, the company has confirmed, but has yet to officially announce or show off the device.) Well, we’ve spent much of this past week considering these very questions. Now, for your reading pleasure, please enjoy our answers, as we all take a moment to catch our breath before we find out just what 2025 has in store.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Multiplayer games live and die by the experiences they offer — gameplay, features, and the community surrounding them. It takes something truly exceptional to shine in a crowded field. Enter Helldivers 2. Combining fun gameplay, diverse missions, and a thriving community, this game didn’t just check the boxes — it nailed them. That’s why it earned the title of Insider Gaming’s Best Multiplayer Game of 2024.</p>



<p>In a poll held on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, the results spoke volumes. Helldivers 2 dominated, capturing 47% of the votes while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 came in second with just 23%.</p>



<p>So, what makes Helldivers 2 the definitive multiplayer experience of the year?</p>



<h3 id="h-a-game-built-around-unity-and-chaos"><strong>A Game Built Around Unity and Chaos</strong></h3>



<p>At its core, Helldivers 2 thrives on its unparalleled sense of community. The premise is simple yet brilliantly executed: spreading democracy, one battle at a time, alongside thousands of other players working toward the same grand objectives. Whether you’re toppling robot regimes, escorting citizens to safety, or obliterating Bile Titans, teamwork is the name of the game. Success isn’t just rewarding, it’s downright euphoric.</p>



<p>And then there are the moments that keep players coming back for more. Maybe it’s the flawless execution of a mission, where everyone plays their part like a well-oiled machine. Or perhaps it’s the chaotic hilarity of failure like a teammate accidentally triggering a mine that you laid or an unexpected ambush leading to utter mayhem and friendly fire. Every session is a mix of camaraderie and comedy, making even defeat an unforgettable experience.</p>



<p>Unlike many multiplayer titles, Helldivers 2 offers a dynamic, player-driven story. There’s no predetermined ending here as your actions shape the game’s future. Each day’s decisions ripple through the universe, influencing what happens weeks or even months down the line. This evolving narrative keeps the stakes high and ensures there’s always a reason to return to the battlefield with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-why-helldivers-2-stands-above-the-rest"><strong>Why Helldivers 2 Stands Above the Rest</strong></h3>



<p>What truly sets Helldivers 2 apart is its emphasis on connection. Arrowhead Game Studios nailed the delicate balance of making players feel like a cog in a massive, universe-spanning machine, while still letting them revel in personal and team triumphs. It’s a rare feat that few multiplayer games achieve so seamlessly.</p>



<p>Whether you’re chasing victory or laughing through chaos, Helldivers 2 delivers on all fronts.</p>

<p>Sony’s neverending success is sure to carry on in 2025 with another stacked schedule already planned. Between PS5 exclusives and major third-party releases, it’s going to be a big year, so let me take you through the biggest PlayStation games set to launch in 2025. </p>



<p>As a PS5 owner, I’m always eager to know what’s next. I’ve invested serious time into big-time PS5 titles this year: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-releasing-for-pc-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rise-of-the-ronins-ps5-pro-update-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a>, and more. The nature of the games industry means there’s little time to dwell though, and I’m already looking ahead to what 2025 has in store.</p>



<p>2024 was somewhat tame compared to 2023, but if the stars align, I feel 2025’s biggest games could usurp them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-ps5-exclusives-coming-in-2025">Biggest PS5 Exclusives Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>As it stands, there are only two major PS5 exclusives with official release dates for 2025. This can change at a moment’s notice, but we’ll go with what we know for now.</p>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I can already tell it’s going to be breathtaking. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is set after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, and Sucker Punch Productions has lofty expectations to meet. The acclaimed studio has brought us Sly Cooper, Infamous, and its newest franchise is the most ambitious of the lot. Ghost of Yōtei is set to grant players more control over the narrative’s twists and turns, and the PS5 is sure to make Feudal Japan look as flawless as possible.</p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What bizarreness awaits this time? Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The only PS5 exclusive we know for sure destined for 2025 is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. The sequel is the brainchild of Hideo Kojima again, and the Japanese visionary only knows how to conjure the weird and wonderful. Trailers and gameplay features have revealed many returning characters and various malevolent forces. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-only-30-40-complete-says-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kojima has indicated a 2025 release</a> is likely, and it could end up being one of PlayStation’s biggest exclusive launches of the year.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-2025-ps5-games">Biggest 2025 PS5 Games</h2>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’m so excited. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a lifelong PlayStation main and DOOM lover, I was really scared for a while I’d seen the last of new DOOM software on PS5. However, due to the insistence of id Software, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> releases simultaneously on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. I don’t even need to say much about The Dark Ages itself. It’s DOOM, it’s the over-the-top FPS action we all know and love, and it has a gun that chews up skeleton heads and regurgitates them as destructive bullets. Book the day off for this one.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s go, Lucia. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas you need to book a week off for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft A</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/">uto 6</a>—if it meets its rumored 2025 launch window. GTA 5 broke countless records—and continues to do so—and has made Rockstar more money than it knows what to do with. GTA 6 is expected to be bigger in every conceivable way, and it can shatter all expectations and records. IF GTA 6 comes out in 2025, it would automatically make the year when one of the best ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A PS5 release is happening. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s future on PS5 was looking bleak. The Microsoft and Bethesda deal put the fate of many titles in doubt, but The Great Circle is getting a PS5 release. Given the title’s glorious reception and its testament to the Indiana Jones name, PS5 owners are in for a treat when it eventually comes to PlayStation 5.</p>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Action is going to be intense. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>2025 is one of the biggest years for Ubisoft in recent memory. Its 2024 was nothing short of disastrous and even catastrophic. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant is shutting down</a>, and Skull and Bones and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws bombed</a>—leading to layoffs. Meaning, the company needs a hit soon. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the first of Ubisoft’s ambitious plan to release at least two new Assassin’s Creed games a new year for the next 10 years. Here’s hoping the famed franchise can bounce back and deliver classic stealthy, sneaky, sleuth-like action!</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Give me bazillions of guns. Credit to Gearbox Software</figcaption></figure>



<p>The world is ready for a new Borderlands game. I’ve loyally played every single iteration—even the Tales spin-offs—and I’m not going to stop now. It’s true, the series’ staple of gun loot and gameplay is becoming stale, and I don’t think Borderlands 3 managed to replace Handsome Jack—or come close. However, one unfortunately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminally-ill-fan-played-borderlands-4-and-said-it-was-amazing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill fan has tried out the latest sequel</a>, and it bodes well for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>. If Gearbox can reinvent the wheel, Borderlands could be back, baby.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’m a Snake. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>The story of Naked Snake and his rise to the top begins with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. 2025 is expected to welcome the fully-fledged remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and you already know it’s going to be good. Featuring the original voice lines—including the ever-iconic David Hayter—and paying homage to the 2004 story, Delta: Snake Eater means we’re eating good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-controller-with-dualsense-like-haptics-is-reportedly-still-on-the-way-for-next-gen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In September 2023, the existence of a new Xbox controller was <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-controller-to-feature-haptics-and-speakers-like-ps5s-dualsense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> due to the inadvertent sharing of an internal Microsoft document as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft legal fight. The controller, codenamed Sebile, would feature improved wireless, direct-to-cloud connection, Bluetooth 5.2, new modular thumbsticks, replaceable and rechargeable batteries, and other minor improvements. The big addition, though, was the DualSense-like haptics feature.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-by-microsofts-head-of-gaming-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his appreciation</a> for the PlayStation 5 controller when it launched alongside Sony's console in late 2020. A few months later, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-phil-spencer-xbox-controller-updates-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> the concept while also teasing that Xbox would have to catch up in this area. The document leak proved he was very serious about that. However, since there haven't been any official updates on the topic, there was no way to know whether the project bore fruit. After all, it could have easily been canceled.</p>
<p>Fans needn't worry too much about that. Tech4Gamers <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> a newly published <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US444401677&amp;_cid=P22-M4Z00G-73974-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patent</a> clearly linked to the Sebile Xbox controller. The patent was originally filed in late August 2023, just before the aforementioned FTC leak. Here's the patent's abstract:</p>
<p><em>A device configured to generate haptic feedback is disclosed. The device includes a housing, a connector, and a haptic motor. The connector includes a mount end coupled to the housing and a distal end spaced away from the mount end. The haptic motor is coupled to the distal end of the connector. Activation of the haptic motor causes the haptic motor to move relative to the housing to generate the haptic feedback.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-sebile-controller-breaks-cover-in-this-new-patent-and-we-now-know-what-that-the-weird-grippy-trousers-are-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed up</a> by adding that the new Xbox controller is definitely still on the way. However, it is now planned to launch alongside the next Xbox console. Microsoft chose not to invest in a mid-generation refresh like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro</a>; they are instead all-in on the forthcoming generation, which Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> would bring the biggest technical leap ever seen in a console.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild rumors</a> that Microsoft could launch the new hardware earlier than Sony, perhaps as soon as 2026, to get an advantage over its competitor (the PlayStation 6 is currently believed to be targeting a 2028 debut). If that's the case, then the Sebile Xbox controller might not be that far off, either.</p>

<p>One of the defining traits of the ARPG genre is the abundance of loot you’ll acquire by clearing zones. Some of it proves helpful, and most of it’s junk, but a game like Path of Exile 2 also features many extras. You’ll find copious amounts of currency, cards, waystones, essences, and more. It’s too much. Sooner rather than later, you’ll need to buy the best stash tabs in Path of Exile 2 to sort your inventory!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-stash-tabs-to-buy-in-poe2">The Best Stash Tabs to Buy in PoE2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>You don’t have to spend much money to enjoy Path of Exile 2. The occasional cosmetic to help the studio with ongoing development costs certainly helps, and I’m more than guilty of buying cosmetics in PoE. Still, you’ll get your money’s worth more so from the stash tabs. A few to invest in include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Premium Stash Upgrades</strong>: You can upgrade your current stash tabs from standard to premium for relatively cheap, allowing you to customize the tab with various colors, affinities, and names to help you better sort through your copious amounts of gear.</li>



<li><strong>Currency Tabs</strong>: Path of Exile 2 features an insane amount of currencies to sift through, and having a dedicated tab allowing you to sort the general and exotic game currencies will help with crafting and upgrades in the future.</li>



<li><strong>Map Tabs</strong>: The more you play PoE2, the more areas you’ll unlock as part of the extensive end game. To ensure you can sort through all of the zones and maps, a map tab allows you to hold maps and waystones more efficiently.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-where-to-buy-stash-tabs">Where to Buy Stash Tabs</h2>



<p>The best way to buy stash tabs in Path of Exile 2 is from the in-game menu. Pause the game and open the menu, then select Microtransaction Shop. It will bring you to the store tabs, where you can find Stash Tabs as one of the top choices. Enter the category, and here you’ll find the various stashes available to you, all of which will cost money via points.</p>



<p>Before you start spending, however, keep in mind that developer Grinding Gear Games often holds sales, allowing you to buy stash tabs and other microtransactions for significantly cheaper than their going price.</p>

This option is available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers and lets them play a large library of games across multiple devices, including tablets, phones, and TVs. However, as of 4:30 p.m. ET today, Xbox doesn’t seem to have a timetable for when streaming will be back up and running for everyone.</p><p>On December 26, about an hour after the outage started, Xbox support tweeted out that the company was “aware” that “users may be experiencing issues launching Cloud Gaming titles.” The account told people to check on the official Xbox status page for updates. Since then, things haven’t improved much. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1872673740628140318&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1872673740628140318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 27 at 10 a.m. ET</a></span>, the company posted a follow-up claiming that users might see a long wait time displayed when launching a game on the cloud, but that this wait time wasn’t accurate. However, checking the comments on the post and elsewhere, it still seems like people can’t even connect and play games on their phones or other devices. As of 3:30 p.m. ET, the Xbox support page states: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“We’re close to resolving the issue.”</a></span></p><p>I expect the issue will be resolved, likely a few hours after this post goes live (or sooner).

You didn’t need an Xbox if you were a Game Pass subscriber with phone or a smart TV. You could just stream all those games instantly. And as a result, I imagine that this Christmas season saw a lot of kids and teens get Game Pass subs so they can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-owned-games-50-list-pc-1851704063?_gl=1*1le1ck1*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTMzMDI5NS4xODMuMS4xNzM1MzM0MjYyLjU1LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-owned-games-50-list-pc-1851704063?_gl=1*1le1ck1*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTMzMDI5NS4xODMuMS4xNzM1MzM0MjYyLjU1LjAuMA..">stream games without their parents having to buy a pricey Xbox</a></span>. </p><p>A lot of people are probably experiencing cloud streaming for the first time this holiday season and, well, this outage is a very blunt reminder that while you can stream games on your phone, it ain’t an Xbox. An Xbox can work without an internet connection, and it can play your games offline. A phone can’t. Maybe Xbox should make that more clear in all those cute ads promoting every device as an Xbox? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> did huge numbers when it was released in June 2023, with positive reviews, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-passes-666-million-in-sales-sets-new-blizzard-record/1100-6515145/">impressive sales numbers</a>, and over 12 million players. But for those who finished the game's campaign and dove into its endgame content, the real meat of an ARPG like Diablo, it was clear something was amiss.</p><p dir="ltr">Item progression was frustrating and often felt like a chore. There were few endgame activities and little reason to do them. Seasonal updates added new mechanics and smaller fixes but didn't solve the underlying structural issues players had with the latest entry in Blizzard's legendary loot-chasing franchise. It carried echoes of Diablo 3's 2012 launch, when players quickly became frustrated by its endgame loop (and its real-money auction house). Was Blizzard repeating the same mistake twice?</p><p dir="ltr">What a difference a year makes. Whereas it took around two years for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-3-went-from-disastrous-launch-to-a-hell-of-a-good-time/1100-6503426/">Diablo 3 to become great</a> with the addition of its Reaper of Souls expansion, Diablo 4 today is vastly improved to the one of last year or even just seven months ago. Whereas I quickly fell off Diablo 4's endgame loot grind at launch, I'm now hooked thanks to free updates that overhauled itemization and revamped its difficulty. Diablo 4's endgame loop is now extremely satisfying, and I'm continuing to chase those smaller upgrades and highly coveted Mythic Unique items that could take my character ever slightly further--something that felt like a fool's errand a year ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the biggest changes came alongside Diablo 4's appropriately named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/">Loot Reborn update</a> in May. Items gained fewer affixes but ones that were more useful, making it easier to parse at a glance whether an item may be useful or not. Legendary Aspects, once a chore to find and replace, became an almost automated process, with salvaged Legendary items automatically having their Aspects added to the in-game codex for easy imprinting on future items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410659" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410659"></a><figcaption>Masterworking gives players a reason to grind out endgame activities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The addition of two new itemization systems, Masterworking and Tempering, is what truly took Diablo 4's items and its endgame into overdrive. Tempering allowed players to add certain affixes to items in order to hand-craft the perfect weapon or piece of armor. Masterworking, meanwhile, pushed players to upgrade a Tempered item into the ultimate version of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Loot Reborn proved to be a game-changer, not only because of the agency it gave players when it came to gearing up, but also for giving reasons to continue deep into Diablo 4's endgame. The addition of The Pit, a new timed endgame dungeon where materials needed to Masterwork items could be found, additionally gave players more goals to chase.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as these systems overhauled Diablo 4's items and endgame, the game's 2.0 update, released alongside its first expansion in October, pushed things even further. Blizzard dropped the game's confusing World Tier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/">difficulty system and instead replaced it with one more akin to Diablo 3</a>. It reorganized the endgame to form a more satisfying endgame progression loop, with Masterworking materials shifting to be found in Nightmare dungeons, and Glyph XP moving to The Pit. A new roguelite endgame activity introduced in Diablo 4 Season 5, Infernal Hordes, became a permanent fixture in update 2.0, giving players more options when it came to choosing how to spend their endgame time.</p><p dir="ltr">All of those changes are without even mentioning the additions that came as part of the paid Vessel of Hatred expansion. It added a new region to explore, continued the game's story, introduced an additional endgame activity in the Kurast Undercity, brought recruitable Mercenaries into the fray, tossed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/">Runewords into the build-customizing equation</a>, and added a brand-new (and very overpowered) class: the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/">Spiritborn</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410660" data-ratio="0.56256983240223" data-width="1790" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410660"></a><figcaption>Infernal Hordes adds some roguelite flair to Diablo 4's endgame loop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, when it comes to the endgame, players have choices. Do I need to Masterwork my gear more? I can run Nightmare dungeons or Infernal Hordes. Maybe I need to upgrade my Glyphs, so I'll hit up The Pit for a bit. If I'm looking for runes, a particular type of item, or materials, I can do an Undercity Tribute run with that specific goal in mind. Or if I'm looking for a certain Unique or Mythic Unique item, I can target-farm one of the endgame bosses for a higher chance of finding what I'm looking for. Diablo 4's endgame now lets me easily work towards whatever goals I have for my character and gives me options when doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these endgame activities feed into each other. Running The Pit will give me tributes to use for the Undercity. Doing Undercity can give me boss-summoning materials. Defeating those bosses will give me Infernal Horde keys, which I can then use to gain Masterworking materials. It all feeds into itself in a satisfying endgame loop that keeps me playing, slaying, and upgrading, something that was definitely not the case when Diablo 4 launched.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say there's no room for improvement. Though there is now much more to do in Diablo 4's endgame, there are few real challenges or reasons to keep pushing after a certain point. Most dedicated players will be able to easily clear higher-levels of The Pit or defeat the game's Torment bosses on the game's highest difficulty, after which gear upgrades simply allow players to clear those activities slightly faster. Doing things faster can be fun (and makes for efficient farming) but can lose its luster after a while without additional goals to pursue. Bugs also continue to be an ongoing issue, and Blizzard could benefit from putting a bit more polish on updates before releasing them out into the wild (something the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-ever-public-test-realm-is-live-now/1100-6522348/">public test realm, also introduced this year</a>, does help with).</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's road of refinement likely won't be coming to an end anytime soon, but I am impressed at how far it has come in a relatively short amount of time. Even though Vessel of Hatred proved to be an excellent addition, it was this year's free Loot Reborn and 2.0 updates, more than the paid expansion, that transformed Diablo 4 from just "okay" into a great ARPG worthy of the Diablo name. It's fitting that Diablo 4 found its footing just ahead of Grinding Gear Games releasing the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/">Path of Exile 2 into early access</a>. Suddenly, the battle to be the top ARPG in the genre Blizzard invented is heating up. If Diablo 4's 2025 is anything like its 2024, next year will be a banner year for the genre, and I can't wait to see what's in store.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6.1070205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's rumored that Call of Duty will be receiving an additional premium pass for the Squid Game event that is coming soon to <a href="https://wccftech.com/eight-of-octobers-best-selling-games-were-new-releases-black-ops-6-on-top/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Call of Duty: Warzone. The event was officially teased yesterday, where it's said that those who participate in the event will be able to get skins of operatives themed around the hit TV show, as well as blueprints of weapons and other content that fits the Squid Game theme. The crossover event is set to begin on January 3, but more details haven't been released.</p>
<p>This is already causing quite a stir from both Squid Game fans and Call of Duty fans, with some saying that they're completely missing the point of the TV show. The TV show is all about living in a dystopian, capitalist world where people are willing to fight to the death for money. The show just recently got a second season, which was released yesterday on Netflix.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty x Squid Game 2 Trailer | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lzXgt2aR_IM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The rumor of the premium pass comes from a user called <a href="https://x.com/xFleXy_/status/1872710285649428579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xFleXy_ on X</a>, where they posted a screenshot of a message that pops up when you load the game. The message reads as the following:</p>
<p><em>Squid Game arrives in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. Explore an exhilarating Event Pass, where the Premium Track route allows for more incredible rewards, including the Front Man Operator. Plus, a myriad of LTM's will feature signature sinister takes on Red Light/Green Light mechanics.</em></p>
<p>A lot of people also have issues with the game having premium battle passes due to the fact that a significant amount of people who purchased the game would have paid at least $70 for it rather than playing it via Xbox Game Pass for the long haul. Seeing a paid game with a ton of microtransactions is never a great feeling, and it makes more sense for the event pass to be in Call of Duty: Warzone, as that is the free-to-play Battle Royale set in the CoD universe.</p>
<p>It hasn't been specified how much this pass will cost as of yet, but as the event looms closer, there will most likely be new details given about the event and the rewards that you will be able to obtain by participating.</p>
<p>Will you be getting the battle pass for the Squid Game event?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/three-pokemon-tcg-collections-coming-in-2025-complete-with-unique-items<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> collections are coming next year. Fans of The Pokemon Company's enduring card game should watch for these collections. They will contain unique cards and special physical products for hardcore Pokemon fans.</p>

<h2>The Pokemon TCG Collections Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a post <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/12/three-tcg-collections-releasing-in-2025-with-new-unique-items-including-lenticular-card" rel="nofollow">on Pokebeach</a>, three new <em>Pokemon TCG</em> collections will be available in North America in 2025.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-postcard-image.jpg?itok=Dm707iHS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-postcard-image.jpg?itok=Kp3t_xPA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these is an "ex-Collection Box" that will be released alongside the <em>Journey Together</em> set on March 28. This set is notable since it will bring back Owners' Pokemon cards. The Collection Box will contain three promo cards, one jumbo card, four booster packs, a code card, and a Polaroid-style postcard.</p>

<p>The last time a Polaroid was included in one of these boxes was part of the 2001 <em>Southern Islands</em> set.</p>

<p>The second of these Pokemon TCG collections is a new Premium Collection box coming April 11. The box will contain six boosters, two promo cards, a photo sticker, a backdrop card, and an acrylic standee sheet.</p>

<p>The post mentions how these products will work isn't entirely clear. However, acrylic stands have been released at Japan's Pokemon Centers before featuring different characters. There's a chance they may operate similarly, letting fans have little dioramas of beloved characters on display.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-pokemon-trainer-pack.jpg?itok=6NzGO2bD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-pokemon-trainer-pack.jpg?itok=VLUjwljl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lastly, April 11 will also see the release of a new Special Collection. This will contain five boosters, a code card, three promo cards, and a jumbo lenticular card. This is major since the last time a lenticular card was released, it was in promotion of the 2004 <em>Pokemon Destiny Deoxys</em> movie.</p>

<p>This is different from the lenticular posters contained in certain <em>Pokemon TCG</em> marketing kits. While nice bits of promotion, these promo items aren't real cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Pokemon TCG</em> is one of the most popular trading card games in the world. Its popularity has only grown thanks to the massive success of the mobile game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em></a><em>.</em></p>

While trying to escape capture on top of a moving train, Jun-Fan is moments away from being thrown off the train until Uatu intervenes by knocking the bad guys to the ground after insinuating that a tragic end for the young boy happens in other timelines.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-could-be-bringing-new-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers.1070187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft could be brining updated technology to future Xbox controllers in the form of haptic motors. First found by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a recently <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US444401677&amp;_cid=P22-M4Z00G-73974-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed patent</a> suggests Xbox controllers will get new haptic feedback features sometime soon.</p>



<p>According to the patent’s abstract, the new motor features a housing, connector, and haptic motor. Upon activation, the haptic motor will “move relative to the housing to generate the haptic feedback”.</p>



<p>In the patent description, it’s claimed that the haptic motor can be “dynamically” tuned for device optimization. What’s more is that it’s said that the motor can create two types of vibration in order to increase the depth and feel of the feedback. Based on the full contents of the document, it’s suggested that players would get a more personalized experience with the new motors.</p>

<p>“The concepts described herein enhance a haptic response of a device by incorporating haptic subcomponents into a moving or flexible mechanical architecture of the device that allows for the haptic motor to move relative to a housing of the device,” the patent reads. “This allows for a lower cost, weight, size, and energy consuming haptic component to perform similar to a larger haptic component, or to enhance the haptic response of the larger haptic component.”</p>



<p>With these new moveable and adjustable haptic motors, it seems to be Microsoft’s answer to the popular DualSense controller introduced this console generation from Sony. Microsoft has been developing its new Sebile controller for a while now, and this could be the start of finding out some of its features.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-sebile-controller-breaks-cover-in-this-new-patent-and-we-now-know-what-that-the-weird-grippy-trousers-are-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden of Windows Central</a>, this new controller isn’t likely to launch before the next generation of Xbox hardware.</p>

<p>Following the positively stellar month of February, a relatively quiet month in March, and now looking forward to the upcoming summer, one would expect April to be relatively tame. Well, that’s correct. The biggest video game releases in April 2025 don’t overly impress, with a few remasters and plenty of niche titles, but don’t expect much in the way of AAA.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-april-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of April 2025</h2>



<p>It appears April is the month of visual novels and niche role-playing games, with a heavy dose of action-adventure tossed in for good measure from the indie and AA scene. For those of you who have spent time awaiting The Last of Us Part II on PC, that’s the big release for the month, and it’s not even a new one!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</strong> (PC) – April 3, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Koira </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5) – April 17, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</strong> (PC/Nintendo Switch) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tempest Rising</strong> (PC) – April 24, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with this small handful of titles, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time launches on Nintendo Switch sometime in April 2025, though we don’t have an official release date yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-may-2025">Looking Forward to May 2025</h2>



<p>As of publishing this piece, May is a relatively quiet month with only a handful of titles, most of which are TBA currently, but we suspect more will come as we delve into the year further.</p>



<ul>
<li>Sonic Wings Reunion</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Plenty</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-pc-game-of-2024-best-new-pc-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PC gaming in 2024 was nothing short of extraordinary. This year, developers pushed boundaries, delivering games that dazzled with immersive visuals, innovative mechanics, and stories that kept players glued to their screens. From blockbuster titles redefining beloved genres to indie gems that captured hearts with their creativity, the lineup was packed with unforgettable experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we look back on the year, these are the standout PC games that left their mark and reminded us why gaming on PC is truly unmatched. Let’s dive into the best PC games of 2024 – the ones that raised the bar and set new standards for the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we get into it, it’s worth mentioning that these are games that are either exclusive to PC or released first on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-pc-game-of-2024-winner-hades-2">Best PC Game Of 2024 Winner — Hades 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game may have released in “early access” in May, but Hades 2 feels like anything but an early access title. The game takes so much of what made the first game great, and adds to it in ways that make it nearly perfect.</p>



<p>Set after the events of the original game, Hades 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">puts players in the role of Melinoë</a>, the Princess of the Underworld and sister of Zagreus, the first game’s protagonist. Guided by her mentor, Hecate, Melinoë’s mission is to stop Chronos, the Titan of Time, who has risen to challenge the gods and mortals who once opposed him.</p>



<p>While the game has a lot of similarities to the orginal, the addition mechanics and features put it over the top. Hades 2 adds a new  Magick Bar that players use for various moves that you recharge as you play. There’s even a new sprint ability that opens up a new world of movement and agility while you play. Hades 2 also introduces multiple pathes to the surface: from&nbsp;Erebus&nbsp;to Tartarus or&nbsp;Ephyra&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mount Olympus.</p>



<p>What makes the game even better, is that it can be completed in under 20 hours if that’s your cup of tea. However, if you are a completionist who needs to do everything in a game, then Hades 2 can teak you nearly 60 hours to do everything. It’s really up to how you want to play.</p>



<h2>Best PC Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>While Hades 2 stood out as the best PC game of 2024, that doesn’t mean there weren’t other great options for players. From action to city-building, there was something for every type of game this year. Here are some of the other top PC games to release over the last 12 months.</p>



<h3>I Am Your Beast</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Released in September, I Am Your Beast is another excellent game from Strange Scaffold. You play as former government agent Alphonse Harding who is asked to do “one last job”. After turning it down, you find yourself against the same group that tried to recruit you in the first place.</p>



<p>The game features fast-paced action that has made it popular for speed running. It also has some of the most violent yet enticing gameplay you’ll find from any game, let alone an indie title. I Am Your Beast features 25 levels that make you feel like you are playing a modern version of classic Doom and Duke Nukem 3D just in shorter bursts. Those short bursts — the levels take only a couple minutes to get through — helps with that feeling of wanting to keep coming back for more.  It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a great hook</a> that gives you that “just one more level” feeling every time. It’s a game that becomes hard to put down once you get started.</p>



<h3>UFO 50</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dozens of games within a single game make for a great game. Yeah, you read that right. UFO 50 features 50 different games from various genres. The game acts as a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“showcase” of the games</a> developed by UFO Soft for the LX-I, LX-II, and LX-III consoles during the 1980s. While the fictional showcase is a cool concept, it’s the games you can play that make it just so good. </p>



<p>Bushido Ball takes a simple concept like Pong and adds samurai swords, ninjas, and shot abilities. Then there’s the RPG Grimstone that feels like the old Final Fantasy games. My favorite, however, is the Metroidvania Mini &amp; Max. It takes a number of great concepts from the genre, and makes t hem easy and accessible. It’s one of those games that even as a standalone game would be considered a good indie game.</p>



<p>No matter what you’re into, there’s bound to be a game in UFO 50 to feed your appetite. Of course, there’s also the hidden 51st game that’s just as much fun as the first 50.</p>



<h3>Frostpunk 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A highly-anticipated city-builder, Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released in September</a> to mass acclaim from most players and critics. The game is set 30 years after the “Great Storm” of the first title, and sees players take on the role of the “Steward” following the death of the original Captain. As you play, you have to handle population issues, resource scarcity, and the transition into a new era. Building upon the first game, Frostpunk 2 also lets you build a bigger city with districts that serve specific purposes.</p>



<p>As you expand and create districts, you also have to manage factions with different ideologies, leading to potential conflict among citizens. Lastly, there’s a council that represents the different factions that you present your laws and regulations to. You function more like an actual government in Frostpunk 2 than any city-builder I’ve played before it, and it sets a stage for what I believe future games in the genre should strive for.</p>



<p>This PC game was so well received that it even won the Best Gameplay award at the Gamescom Awards 2024. It’s so much more than your typical city-builder that Frostpunk 2 is a game that you can easily get lost in for hours at a time. </p>
