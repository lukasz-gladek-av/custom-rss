<p id="7e50o5">Neither of these mushroom Pokémon see any use in raids, gyms, or PvP content. Their shinies are great, since they go from a spring coloring to a nice autumn red-yellow-brown.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Morelull in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Morelull is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck maintains <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

            <p>

High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has been ousted from Midnight Society, the game development studio he co-founded in 2021, after new allegations relating to his much-publicised Twitch ban surfaced late last week.
</p>
<p>
Beahm was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">permanently banned from Twitch</a> in the summer of 2020 - a year into a two-year exclusivity contract with the company - but neither party has ever revealed why. The closest Twitch came to an explanation was a statement shared at the time of the ban, saying it takes "appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service... regardless of status or prominence in the community." In August 2021, Beahm announced he was suing Twitch over the ban - but the legal dispute was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-settles-legal-dispute-with-twitch-over-2020-permanent-ban">later settled</a>, with neither party admitting to any wrongdoing.
</p>
<p>
And that appeared to be the end of the matter, until last week. On Friday, Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, made a <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">post on social media</a> alleging an unnamed person "got banned because [he] got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang."

<figcaption>Midnight Society is currently working on extraction shooter Deadrop.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io0ptzjAQOs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
While Conners did not name Beahm directly, the connection was quickly made - and his claims were corroborated by two former Twitch employees in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">subsequent report by The Verge</a>, this time explicitly linking the allegations to Beahm.
</p>
<p>
And it's in the wake of these allegations that game developer Midnight Society - which is currently working on free-to-play first-person extraction shooter Deadrop - has now officially parted ways with Beahm, who co-founded the studio with former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021.
</p>
<p>
"On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founders Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect", the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">statement shared on social media</a>. "We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act."
</p>
<p>
"For this reason," the statement continued, "we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."
</p>
<p>
While Beahm hasn't yet formally commented on his split with Midnight Society, the streamer did share a statement on social media after the new allegations began circulating last week. "Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the fucking internet," he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">wrote</a>. "I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."
</p>
<p>
During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E73nGJocgAA">a stream</a> almost immediately prior to Midnight Society's announcement, Beahm told viewers he "definitely [needed] to take a break from everything" and take a "step back", adding, "I mean I'm gonna have to relay this to the Midnight Society, but, you know, maybe I step away from there too. Just completely remove myself from the scene. It's what I need to do."

Amazon currently has a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Oy5Yn" target="_blank">TEAMGROUP GO 1TB Micro SDXC card</a> for only $63.99. For most people, this will be enough space for the entire lifespan of your Switch and at a great price. There's only one Micro SD card slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford.</p><h2>1TB Micro SDXC Card (Switch Compatible) for $63.99</h2><div id="195360"><p><h3>TEAMGROUP Go 1TB U3 A1 Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The Nintendo Switch is an outstanding console, but it doesn't give you much space to install many games out of the box, especially if you purchase digital games off eShop. The Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, with some of it reserved for the OS. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. Fortunately, the Switch features a single memory card expansion slot. It supports up to 2TB Micro SDXC cards, but since 2TB Micro SDXC cards don't exist in the mainsteam market, a 1TB or 1.5TB card is the maximum you can get.</p><p>The 1TB TEAMGROUP Micro SDXC card is compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, any recently released smartphone that supports expandable memory, GoPros, cameras and much more. Despite its low price, the TEAMGROUP is faster than your average Micro SDXC card. It has a U3 A1 rating and boasts transfer speeds of up to 100MB/s read and 50MB/s write. Although TEAMGROUP isn't as well known of a brand as SanDisk or Samsung, this brand has been around for a while and is a legitimate manufacturer of flash-based storage. This particular model has plenty of good reviews on Amazon.</p><h2>Need a faster speed? Choose this one instead.</h2><div id="195361"><p><h3>TEAMGROUP Pro Plus 1TB U3 A2 Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The TEAMGROUP PRO PLUS 1TB Micro SDXC card is U3 A2 rated with transfer speeds up to 160MB/s read and 110MB/s write. This extra speed can't be exploited in a Nintendo Switch, but this is a better Micro SDXC card for mobile electronics that often handle bitrate heavy files like GoPros, smartphones with 4K video recording, DSLR cameras, and PCs with an available Micro SD or SD card slot (an adapter is included).</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 24, 2024 11:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If you're looking for an affordable PC controller, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D73398R9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2C</a> needs to be on your radar. Arriving on July 15, the wireless controller costs just $30 yet offers one of the key perks of pricier 8BitDo models and pro-style controllers from other companies: anti-drift analog sticks. Preorders are now open for the Ultimate 2C at Amazon, with four different colorful styles up for grabs: green, mint, peach, and purple.</p><h3>8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller for PC -- $30</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D739FJLG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D736BCNM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mint</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D73398R9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peach</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D72TNXSC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Purple</a></li></ul><p>Built with Hall Effect sensors, the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C is far less likely to experience the dreaded stick drift that effectively breaks controllers--unless you're comfortable with opening it up and trying numerous possible solutions to fix it.</p><p>In addition to anti-drift sticks, the Ultimate 2C has another feature you'd normally find on pricier controllers: a pair of remappable buttons. Unlike other controllers in the Ultimate series that have rear buttons, the 2C's remappable buttons (R4/L4) are shoulder buttons nestled next to the triggers and regular R/L shoulder buttons. These buttons can be remapped on the fly on the controller itself.</p><p>Other notable features include a turbo function, rumble, clicky buttons and D-pad, and a tactile grip that appears to match the texture of 8BitDo's higher-end Ultimate controllers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png" data-ref-id="1300-4324290" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png" data-ref-id="1300-4324290"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4324291,1300-4324292,1300-4324293,1300-4324294,1300-4324295,1300-4324296,1300-4324297" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg"></figure><hr><p>The Ultimate 2C supports 2.4GHz wireless with Windows 10/11, Android 9.0 and above (with a USB-A adapter), Steam Deck (with a dock), and other handheld PCs with a USB-C hub or dock, including the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028544647762629%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F8bitdos-new-30-wireless-pc-controller-has-anti-drift-sticks-and-remappable-buttons%2F1100-6524462%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM74YFSP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo Legion Go</a>. Though it's not confirmed, we'd expect it to work with the Analogue Pocket, just as the other Ultimate controllers do. It has an impressive 1,000Hz polling rate, so input lag shouldn't be an issue. However, you can also establish a wired connection with the detachable USB-C cable.</p><p>While the Ultimate 2C retains the same form factor as the other Ultimate controllers, its low cost means some notable features aren't present. Most importantly, you can't use 8BitDo's Ultimate software to create profiles, adjust trigger and rumble sensitivity, set up analog stick dead zones, and more.</p><p>If you'd like to have those features in your PC controller, you should opt for the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX5BCWHS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2.4GHz model</a>, which boasts all of the customization features and comes with a matching charging dock.</p><p>Alternatively, if you have a Nintendo Switch or simply like the flexibility of Bluetooth, you should pick up the priciest model, which is arguably still a "budget" controller considering the features. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluetooth model</a> has the Nintendo Switch button labels, while the 2.4GHz mirrors <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Arctic-Camo%2F2186264517%3Fathbdg%3DL1102%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F8bitdos-new-30-wireless-pc-controller-has-anti-drift-sticks-and-remappable-buttons%2F1100-6524462%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's Xbox controller</a>. 8BitDo also recently released a 3-mode model for Xbox, PC, and Android, though it only works wirelessly with PC and mobile, whereas the Xbox connection is wired.</p><p>Beyond the Ultimate lineup, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Switch-Raspberry-Nintendo/dp/B0D4D2TT95?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Pro 2 Bluetooth Controller</a> gets you a great retro design and works with iOS, Switch, PC, and Android.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185172/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-termination<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Midnight Society, the game studio co-founded by Dr Disrespect, has terminated its relationship with the streamer.  In a post on X, <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">the studio wrote</a>, “On Friday evening, we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder’s Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect.” </p><p>That is the day and time that former Twitch employee Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">posted a tweet about</a> the alleged reason for Beahm’s permanent ban, saying it was for “sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product.” Robert Bowling, a former Infinity Ward developer and fellow Midnight Society co-founder, posted shortly after, <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1804390727541305548">saying</a>, “I’m now aware and I’m dealing with it... I landed from Stockholm, reconnected, saw the tweet and immediately began an investigation to learn everything I need to know so I can ensure a full follow through.” </p><div><p>On Sunday, <em>The Verge</em> reported a second Twitch employee who worked on the platform’s trust and safety team at the time of the incident <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">had come forward to corroborate Conner’s post</a>.</p></div><p>“We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act,” reads the post from Midnight Society. “For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately.”</p><p>The announcement came barely an hour after Beahm <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2FE73nGJocgAA%3Fsi%3DWPtWVjG5lcitonh5%26t%3D11574">ended his first stream</a> since the allegations surfaced. In the stream, Beahm said that he was “fatigued” and was considering “removing himself from the scene.” He suggested that he could leave Midnight Society as part of that process. “Maybe I step away from there, too,” he said.</p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">Beahm was banned from Twitch</a> at the height of his popularity and shortly after signing a two-year exclusivity contract with the platform. Neither Twitch nor Beahm would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326873/dr-disrespect-interviews-twitch-disappearance-stream">state the reason why</a>, leading to four years of mystery and speculation. On Friday, </p><p>Beahm <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">denied the allegations in posts to X</a>. “I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid,” he wrote on Saturday.</p><div><p>In 2021, Beahm <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/robert-bowling-dr-disrespect-and-others-create-midnight-society-studio/">co-founded Midnight Society</a> with Bowling and Quinn DelHoyo, who worked on the <em>Halo</em> and <em>Gears of War </em>series. In 2022, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/08/02/dr-disrespect-reveals-deadrop-his-fps-along-with-the-first-real-gameplay-footage/">Midnight Society announced <em>Deadrop</em></a>,<em> </em>an extraction shooter that, at one time, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/05/31/dr-disrespects-midnight-society-is-going-hard-on-nfts-with-polygon-partnership/?sh=3d6658d6552e">sold NFTs as a part of its monetization strategy</a>.</p></div><p>In its post announcing its termination of Beahm, Midnight Society wrote, “While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, June 24th:</strong> Added post from Robert Bowling and clarified Midnight Society’s post.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-studio-cut-ties-allegations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following this weekend’s controversy that saw allegations levelled against Dr Disrespect, the super-sized streamer announced on stream that he’s taking an indefinite break from creating content. This announcement came around the same time that Midnight Society, Dr Disrespect’s game studio working on his extraction shooter, DEADROP, revealed that it would be cutting ties with the creator.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-don-t-know-how-long">‘I Don’t Know How Long’</h2>



<p>This weekend, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">allegations rose against Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm</a>, with an accusation being made that in 2020, he was banned from Twitch permanently for soliciting a minor via the platform’s whisper feature and attempting to meet up with them at TwitchCon. The original allegation came from a former Twitch employee, and while many labelled the claim a grab for attention, other information has come to light that doesn’t look good – such as Midnight Society cutting connections with the creator.</p>



<p>Here’s what Midnight Society said:</p>



<p><em>‘On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founders Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect. </em></p>



<p><em>We assumed his innocence and began speaking with the parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act. </em></p>



<p><em>For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. </em></p>



<p><em>While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.’</em></p>



<p>Around the same time, Dr Disrespect was live on stream, and before he wrapped up, he started talking about how he was tired ‘of all this’ and referenced hating being on social media. He then started rambling slightly, talking about an upcoming vacation and suggesting he’d extend that indefinitely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did have a planned vacation coming up. I think I might just extend that starting today, starting now. One of these… Let’s take a step back. I mean, it is what it is, people get fatigued, right champs? To be honest, I don’t know how long my vacation is, but you know, maybe I extend that. We’ll see. We’ll see.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He requested that his ‘Champions Club’ keep an eye on the socials for signs of his inevitable return, but we’ll have to see how the current situation plays out before that comes around. In his last stream, Doc referenced being tired of being on the camera and stressed that the industry has ‘changed so much’ since he started streaming in 2009, but this claim of being fatigued is believed to just be a front for the potentially devastating circumstances he’s found himself in. </p>



<p>Coincidentally, he suggested he’d ‘step away’ from Midnight Society too in an effort to remove himself from the scene, so he either knew this separation was coming or he was trying to save face. </p>

<p id="sYf2Qt">While any of these bundles are a great value, if we had to choose just three titles to drop in our cart, we’d pick up the Dishonored Complete Collection, <em>Prey</em>, and <em>Fallout 76</em>. The <em>Dishonored Complete Collection</em> brings together both titles in the Dishonored franchise in addition to all of their DLC and the <em>Death of the Outsider</em> expansion. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24151555/prey-arkane-studios-austin-games-microsoft-xbox"><em>Prey</em></a> is a scary, sci-fi immersive sim that pays tribute to games like <em>Deus Ex</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23739112/system-shock-remake-review-release-date"><em>System Shock</em></a><em>. </em>Finally, for fans of Bethesda’s post-nuclear roleplaying game, we can finally recommend trying out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177745/fallout-76-skyline-valley-development-update-journey"><em>Fallout 76</em></a>. </p>
<p id="Vu5tbu">If you’d like to pick up one of the larger bundles, some other titles we can recommend include the turn-based fantasy strategy game, <em>Symphony of War</em>, which will resonate with <em>Fire Emblem</em> fans. Or, you could check out the lo-fi roguelike <em>Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24183247/zelda-echoes-wisdom-theories-trailer-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="kETPO1">For some fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24182328/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-design-change">The Legend of Zelda</a>, there’s just as much fun in theorizing and analyzing the world as there is in playing the games. So, when Nintendo released the first trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a><em>, </em>YouTubers and other fans didn’t waste time getting to work analyzing the trailer and dissecting its every detail. </p>
<p id="ampQ4h">There’s a lot to dive into this time around. Princess Zelda will be the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">playable hero of the story</a> for the first time and wields an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">entirely new weapon</a>, the Tri Rod — and the fact that <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could have connections to previous versions of Hyrule and the series at large has already introduced ample opportunities for people to theorize. There are loads of posts on Reddit with observations, and YouTube is filled with videos analyzing the trailer. It can all be a lot, so Polygon rounded up some of the best theories we’ve seen about <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<h2 id="AJWIAT"><strong>It takes place in the same world as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past </strong></h2>

<p id="yHEBvC">A Reddit post that sparked a conversation on a Zelda subreddit made a convincing argument that the world in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could be connected to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23915877/link-to-the-past-legend-of-zelda-loz-tears-kingdom-totk"><em>A Link to the Past</em></a>. The post includes a screenshot from the trailer, which shows a panoramic vista of Hyrule in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. In it, you can see environments like a forest in the northwestern corner of the map, mountains in the north, and Hyrule Castle in the center. The user argues these locations and the arrangement look similar to those in <em>A Link to the Past</em>, so it could mean it takes place in the same or a similar version of Hyrule. </p>
<h2 id="m2j141"><strong>The Sheikah will be back in the game </strong></h2>
<div id="9hzAmM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bBffi3zP9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="PVheg3">Zeltik, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bBffi3zP9g">a popular theory crafter within the Zelda community</a>, highlighted a moment where the Sheikah appear to return in <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>in two separate instances. The first shows a clip where a character resembling Impa, Zelda’s Sheikah nursemaid in other games, like <em>Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>Oracle of Seasons</em>, attacks soldiers in Hyrule Castle. The appearance of Impa wouldn’t be all that remarkable given she’s in so many games, but then there’s another fun treat: The trailer shows a house that appears to be a workshop or place for research. The room contains glowing orange signs that could be Sheikah symbols, and the character <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23717547/breath-of-the-wild-impa-purah-robbie-paya-master-kohga">looks a lot like Robbie</a> from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. </p>
<h2 id="Wc9wIr"><strong>There will be two kinds of Zora in the game </strong></h2>

<p id="ot8Wdb">This is a small detail, but a fun one: There have always been different designs for the Zora in various Zelda games. The Zora in the original <em>A Link to the Past</em> had a colorful, almost dragonlike look, whereas the Zora we see in more recent games like <em>Ocarina of Time</em> have a sleeker and silvery fishlike look. In another section from Zeltik’s trailer analysis, he shows a clip from the trailer where we can see Zelda standing between both kinds of Zora. He hypothesized that there could be a conflict between the two and that the princess might play a role in mediating tensions between the two groups. </p>
<p id="CJpZgQ">Those are some of the fun theories we’ve found so far, but we will update the article as we get more information about the game. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> will be released on Nintendo Switch on Sept. 26. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Walmart has revealed the dates for its big, new summer sale event, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals%3FathAsset%3DeyJhdGhjcGlkIjoiNTRhNTExMWYtMGEzZi00ODUzLTk3MDMtMDA1NjRhYzg5YWJjIn0%3D%26athena%3Dtrue%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart Deals</a>. It's not the most creative name for a sale, but at least it'll be easy to remember. This year's Walmart Deals event will take place from Monday, July 8, through Thursday, July 11. Though Amazon hasn't revealed this year's dates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>, we know it'll take place in July. Walmart is the first major retailer to announce a Prime Day 2024 competing sale, but it certainly won't be the last.</p><p dir="ltr">While the sale will be accessible to all customers, Walmart+ members can access the discounts starting at 9 am PT/Noon ET. All non-members will gain access to the deals five hours later at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. Normally, Walmart+ costs $13/month or $98/year, but new members can <strong><a href="https://plus.walmart.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a 30-day free trial of Walmart+</a></strong> and get early access to the Walmart Deals event without having to pay for a subscription.

This likely alludes to the sheer number of planned deals, which is in the thousands, but the bold phrasing also suggests the retailer is making a big push to seriously compete with Amazon Prime Day, which has become the best-known sales event in the US outside of Black Friday.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list of limited-time discounts won't be unveiled until Walmart Deals officially starts, but the retailer has already announced a few deals that will be available from July 8 through July 11. The list includes everything from apparel and home appliances to video games, electronics, toys, and more. We picked out a few preview deals from Walmart's list that we think are worth keeping in mind. Note that the prices listed don't go into effect until the sale starts on July 8.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-Party-Red-Blue-Joy-Con-Bundle%2F5216937998%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Party + Joy-Con Bundle</a> -- $69 (<del>$100</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Star-Wars-Hoth-AT-ST-75322-Building-Kit-Construction-Toy-Kids-Aged-9-Up-Buildable-Battle-Walker-4-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back-Characters-586-Pi%2F677686565%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Battle of Hoth AT-ST Kit</a> -- $35 ($<del>50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-Victus-15-6-inch-FHD-144Hz-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-5-8645HS-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-4050-8GB-DDR4-512GB-SSD-Mica-Silver-2024%2F5395277312%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HP Victus 15.6 inch Gaming Laptop</a> -- $599 ($<del>979</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-65-Class-Q-Class-4K-QLED-HDR-Smart-TV-with-Google-TV-65Q650G%2F3733507013%3FadsRedirect%3Dtrue%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TCL 65-inch 4K QLED HDR Smart TV</a> -- $398 ($<del>498</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Watch4-Classic-46mm-Smart-Watch-w-Bluetooth-Stainless-Steel-Black%2F503218134%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Watch6 Classic 46mm (Bluetooth model)</a> -- $99 ($<del>179</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check out more of the upcoming deals at the retailer's dedicated <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals%3FathAsset%3DeyJhdGhjcGlkIjoiNTRhNTExMWYtMGEzZi00ODUzLTk3MDMtMDA1NjRhYzg5YWJjIn0%3D%26athena%3Dtrue%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart Deals store page</a>.

The original Deck offers the same performance and resolution (1280 x 800) as the OLED model, albeit at a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz, and it easily plays most compatible games on Steam save for the most graphically demanding titles.</p><p>The OG Deck can even play some big open-world games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> and its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> expansion. However, FromSoftware’s excellently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">punishing</a> RPG is currently in need of a hotfix to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182545/elden-ring-has-an-issue-on-steam-deck-right-now">resolve an ongoing issue</a> when the game is left inactive on the Steam Deck for five minutes. Also, if you’re opting for the 64GB model, be sure to have a microSD card to expand it. That base storage may be fine when downloading tiny indies, but it fills up fast with bigger games. (Don’t even dream of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23944733/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-storage"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>.)

She, like most job-givers in <em>Starfield</em>, wants you to play freelance cop and go hunt down people with bounties on their heads. After chatting with her, you’ll fast-travel-menu-maze yourself to Akila City where you’ll chat with some other bounty hunters, including the either clever or cringe-worthy “No. 1,” who sometimes calls themself “no one.” </p><p>Yes. That is the character’s name. It makes me imagine a backstory in which they come up with that name while listening to some godforsaken emo music as they paint their nails black, softly whispering to themselves that <em>no one understands them</em> before dramatically sighing. Hey, it’s a Bethesda game, headcanoning stuff is almost required (and at least that’s free…<em>for now</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-recommend-id="image://82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-recommend-id="image://82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even if you choose not to shell out seven bucks for the new quest, called “The Vulture,” the Trackers’ Alliance grants you two things: A somewhat interesting, free quest that goes unresolved, and the ability to hunt down random NPCs who have bounties on their heads (where you can either take ‘em in or just murder them). </p><p>That free quest, titled “The Starjacker,” sends you out into the stars to hunt down a wanted man named Hanibal. The premise ain’t bad, and while it does boil down to just shooting your way through some random place in space, this bounty hunting concept is a decent way to make use of <em>Starfield</em>’s enormous galaxy.</p><p>Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot of mystery to this. You’ll interrogate a dude and then be given a quest marker to follow before blasting your way through a zero-grav space station. Then you’ll find out Hanibal ain’t on this space station. Your bounty is somewhere out there in the seeming endlessness of space and you’ve got no leads. </p><p>While what you do in this quest isn’t anything special (shoot, shoot, shoot, Starborn power!, shoot, shoot, shoot), the way it leaves you with this unresolved task and no leads to go on in this massive space simulation is kind of neat, and it interrupts the flow of <em>Starfield</em>’s check-list style questing. It makes <em>Starfield</em>’s galaxy <em>feel</em> large as you’re left to imagine where in this 1,000-plus-planet sector of space this guy might be hiding. </p><p>But, then, that’s it. Well, until you fork over seven bucks and buy “The Vulture.” And much like “The Starjacker,” there are some neat ideas here. Hints of promise of how this massive galaxy could be used for interesting quests. Unfortunately, spending seven bucks just gives you more of that hollow potential. </p><h2 id="h749"><a id=""></a>A lifeless quest fit for a vulture’s feast</h2><p>The quest has you hunting down a colony war vet, the titular Vulture, who has turned his back on the Freestar Collective. This errand will send you to two locations: a planet in the Narion system and the Paradiso resort. (If you used that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-mod-quest-paradiso-kill-npc-essential-1851540229&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-mod-quest-paradiso-kill-npc-essential-1851540229">super cool mod I told you about</a></span> recently and made everyone at Paradiso mad at you, this quest is probably broken now.

But at least it tries to inject some personality into its very brief runtime.</p><p>After arriving in the Narion system to find the Vulture, you’ll have a chat with a very scared dude who warns you that your quest to track down the assassin has put you “in hot water.” As if to prove the point, this poor sap’s warning is cut off mid-sentence as he’s offed by a shot from the Vulture’s sniper rifle. You’ll then attempt to chase the killer down, which, wouldn’t you know it, involves taking out a bunch of randos in your path.</p><p>Your pursuit will then take you to the resort of Paradiso. There, I accidentally agreed to handle the lost-and-found for the concierge before realizing I needed to go to an upper floor to check out the Vulture’s suite. There’s a neat moment in which, after searching his room, the Vulture, perched somewhere off in the distance, shoots out a window to try and get to you. As you dash out in pursuit, you’ll have to engage in a hallway firefight. </p><p>For a split second, there’s a level of urgency and activity in a place that’s otherwise a static, virtual diorama of a resort. That sort of action is something that <em>Starfield</em> could use more of. Exchanging fire in a place not meant for violence gave me some <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> vibes, and made Paradiso feel like a real place connected to this grander galaxy with competing interests that boil over into violence. All that’s to say, yes, give me a cool shootout in this bougie hellscape. </p><p>But once I got down to the ground floor, that immersion ended. I walked through the lobby of NPCs just standing around, saying random bullshit, undisturbed by the fact that loud-ass gunfire was happening two floors above them just a moment ago. I was once again reminded of how rigid and lifeless <em>Starfield</em>’s environments were. </p><figure id="" data-id="cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-recommend-id="image://cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-recommend-id="image://cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And when I spotted the Vulture up in his sniper’s nest, people around me seemed to care less that I, a fully armed lunatic of a woman, was firing her gun at some random point in the distance. No one went running. No security guards urged me to drop my weapon. Nobody batted an eye as a gunfight raged on in this resort. </p><p><em>Starfield</em> has always sort of been on rails. But “The Vulture” explodes the sheer level of lifelessness coded into this game. I get it, it’s no immersive sim. Still, how am I supposed to roleplay as a star-hopping bounty hunter, pursuing her targets in the middle of public environments and getting into high-stakes gunfights, when the world barely reacts to these events? </p><p>And as far as the actual challenge? I love a good sniper battle. But the game literally gave me Starborn powers that let me suspend enemies in mid-air, go invisible, and slow down time. I’m virtually a god in this allegedly grounded, realistic science-fiction world, and not in a cool way. </p><p>But “the Vulture” doesn’t just suck as a quest. And it doesn’t just suck as an absurdly priced DLC. It, and the Trackers’ Alliance, expose the deep flaws inherent in <em>Starfield</em> that a mere faction quest isn’t going to heal. <em>Starfield</em> needs more than simple content injected into its massive canvas. It needs to consider how its canvas helps or hurts otherwise relatively decent premises like hunting down a renegade war vet hiding in a populated area. </p><figure id="" data-id="074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-recommend-id="image://074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Note: clip has been sped up for brevity.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-recommend-id="image://074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h750"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield</em> remains a rigid, clunky experience</h2><p>Let’s rewind to the “Starjacker” quest for a second. In this quest, you’re asked to go hunt down this Hanibal guy, and a member of the Trackers’ Alliance tags along, keeping an eye on you and making sure you’re up to snuff for this kind of work. </p><p>You’re given a random ship to go on this job which, as soon as you sit down in the cockpit chair, becomes your “home” ship, thus warping in all of your crew and followers. Here I was trying to immerse myself in the premise of this bounty hunter faction quest, yet the second I sit down, Sarah pipes up with “I have something for you,” and as I get up, I’m once again stuck inside the cockpit because I can’t move past Sam’s damn daughter as she turns to talk to me again about the same damn books she’s reading. </p><p>All of this, combined with the absolutely lifeless reactions of the NPCs in “The Vulture,” make the experience of <em>Starfield</em> itself feel like a kitbashed collection of mods. There’s no <em>authorship</em>, no expression of a vision, no material worth investing your time in. It’s just rigid nonsense with clunkily intersecting systems.</p><p>If <em>Starfield</em> is to grow into something beyond an impressively sized canvas just waiting for you to roll your own space game by way of mods, it needs to have these foundational issues addressed. </p><p>It’s not even a question of whether or not “The Vulture” is worth seven dollars. <em>Starfield</em> itself is not worth investing seven dollars in right now, and based on the review bombing the game has recently suffered on Steam, it’s obvious that a lot of folks feel this way. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A remake of the original Jet Set Radio is in development at SEGA, and screenshots from the game have been leaked online. </p>



<p>The four screenshots come from an early in-development version of the game. They give players a look at the game’s map, environment, art style, and more. Obviously, with it being so early in the development, things are likely — and expected — to change. </p>



<p>According to the poster, the images come from around 2021, and aren’t related to the free-to-play live service game that’s also in development. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A remake of the original Jet Set Radio is in the works at SEGA, it is a full remake of the Dreamcast game and it is not related to the F2P reboot.</p><p>Source: Midori <a href="https://t.co/D7Cd8yDLly">pic.twitter.com/D7Cd8yDLly</a></p></div>— Senhorita Kazzy (@MSKAZZY69) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSKAZZY69/status/1805073421916569982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to SEGA about the legitimacy of the screenshots. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Jet Set Radio first released in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast. Since then, it has been released on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PS Vita, iOS, and Android. It’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-outlines-segas-plans-for-new-slate-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of a handful of games</a> receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remakes and reboots at SEGA</a>, including&nbsp;Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. </p>

There are some excellent PC games on offer at a very affordable price, starting with two games for $7, three games for $10, or five games or more for $3 each. There are 16 games in all, so you could buy the whole package for only $48. But since most fans probably have some of these games, making a bundle of five games for $15 will probably make more sense.</p><p>The best part? Each game code you buy can be redeemed on GOG, meaning that these are DRM-free titles that you can play without needing to first connect online to authenticate your purchase. Simply download, install, and you're good to go, making this a very tempting deal for anyone using a gaming laptop or a mobile PC gaming system like a ROG Ally. You can also play these games on Steam Deck. You simply need to install GOG or a handy launcher suite such as <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heroic</a>.</p><h2>Fanatical Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</h2><ul><li>Wolfenstein: The New Order</li><li>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood</li><li>Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</li><li>Dishonored: Definitive Edition</li><li>Dishonored: Death of the Outsider</li><li>Dishonored 2</li><li>The Evil Within</li><li>The Evil Within 2</li><li>Doom 3</li><li>Prey</li><li>The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind of the Year Edition</li><li>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition</li><li>Quake</li><li>Quake 2</li><li>Quake 3: Arena</li><li>Quake 4</li></ul><p>For the games, you're getting some excellent fantasy, war, and sci-fi-themed adventures. Wolfenstein fans can grab the action-packed New Order, The Old Blood, and The New Colossus games, good-looking masterpieces of exhilarating gameplay. For something more subtle than blasting away an army of Nazis there are the Dishonored games, a potent combination of swords and sorcery where you're encouraged to think outside of the box.</p><p>Prey is also a very cerebral experience, full of cool retro-futuristic gadgets and coffee mugs that'll make you paranoid. Then there's Doom 3, a rock-solid mix of action and horror, Game of the Year editions of The Elder Scrolls titles Morrowind and Oblivion, and a whole lot of Quake. If you're looking to relive the LAN days of yesteryear, you can't go wrong with Quake 3 Arena and its lightning-fast gameplay.

True to his word, the days following Shadow of the Erdtree’s June 21 launch have seen many players take to social media to lament that the new content is simply too hard, while others complained of performance issues, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance?_gl=1*5kif15*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTE0MDgxMzMwLjE3MTkyNDEzNjQ.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTI0MTM2NC4xLjAuMTcxOTI0MTM2NC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_BBZCZLHBF6*MTcxOTI0MTM3OS4xLjAuMTcxOTI0MTM3OS4wLjAuMA..">leading to a ‘mixed’ review on Steam</a>.</p><p>However, its fearsome difficulty hasn’t stopped Karyal from attempting to take on the DLC using a very unconventional method of controlling her tarnished, which also proves that 90 percent of a FromSoftware boss fight plays out between the ears. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/1805008470166450460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Karyal made headlines last year after beating Elden Ring’s base game content while using an electroencephalography (EEG) brain monitoring headset to control specific in-game actions such as attacking, and rolling. EEG technology is ordinarily used by physicians as a diagnostic tool. However, after encountering the brain-scanning headwear while studying for a masters degree in psychology she became curious as to whether the technology could be adapted to control video games as part of a virtual controller.</p><p>To that end Karyal was able to use some fancy coding to train the software that came with her commercial EEG headset to recognize patterns in her brain’s electrical activity that were brought about when she imagined a particular object, action, or emotion. Each pattern was then assigned to an input on a virtual controller, which allowed Karyal to execute actions with her mind by imagining things during gameplay. For example, by imagining herself pushing a cube forward she could execute a roll, or alternatively she could imagine a plate spinning to make her tarnished perform an attack, or simply make herself angry to heal.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WE DID IT</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, first boss, COMPLETED with mind control, and ZERO HANDS</p><p>I can't believe it. This was the hardest thing ever. We've come SO FAR!

Absolutely INSANE</p><p>Let's gooooooooooo</p><p>If you have any questions, look at the full VOD below - I do set-up, training, and troubleshooting all LIVE <a href="https://t.co/H0UpxUj8hz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/H0UpxUj8hz</a></p></div>— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/1804922119416860997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>During the 2023 Elden Ring runthrough Karyal had still been beholden to a physical Xbox controller to dictate the movement of her tarnished warrier. However, for Shadow of the Erdtree, the streamer opted to attempt a completely hands-free run, by using eye-tracking software to track the movement of her head to control her character's movement, and voice prompts to trigger more nuanced actions, including saying “I choose you” to summon a spirit ash. Navigating to bosses also required a completely different command setup to the one used during the climactic fights themselves, adding another layer of mental gymnastics to the process.</p><p>Impressively, Karyal  has already managed to use her mind-control approach to take down two challenging early DLC bosses in the Divine Beast Dancing Lion, and Rellana, the Twin Moon Knight. Of course this isn’t the first time that FromSoftware fans have employed a non-traditional controller to shame Elden Ring bosses. Just last year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-streamer-missmikkaa-simultaneously-defeated-two-malenias-with-a-dance-pad-and-a-controller">Twitch streamer MissMikkaa managed to beat two Malenias simultaneously in two separate instances of the game while using a Dance Pad and a PS5 DualSense</a>. Another FromSoftware challenge runner by the name <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-no-hit-run-electric-saxophone-controller-playthrough">Dr. Decomposing was also able to complete a no-damage run while using a modified electric saxophone</a> as a controller.</p><p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC?_gl=1*hhybk0*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTcxODI5MzYyNi4xNzE5MjQ3MzAz*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTI0NzMwMi4xLjAuMTcxOTI0NzMwMi4wLjAuMA..">IGN’s interactive map and comprehensive guide</a> for all the tips, tricks, and walkthroughs that you need to get the most out of your time in the Land of Shadow, or read up on how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-have-begun-and-yes-most-make-it-easier">modders are already finding ways to make the game easier on PC</a>.</p><p><em>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A standout puzzler with an enticing story, clever riddles, and a perfectly eerie vibe.</h2></div><div><section><p>A lot of tears have been shed and drinks poured out over the “death” of the classic point-and-click adventure game. While some stalwarts like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-monkey-island-review"><u>Return to Monkey Island</u></a> have valiantly kept the torch burning, the days of walking around 2D environments shoving seemingly unrelated items into your pockets and then pushing them up against equally random objects in cryptic combinations have largely passed. With that in mind, it seems especially fitting that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, the latest from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/17/sayonara-wild-hearts-review">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> developer Simogo, is a puzzle game very much about gazing back through the tangle of time (in more ways than one). The striking style of this exceptionally clever adventure may not look familiar on the surface, but at its heart, it’s the closest thing I’ve played to a modernization of what a point-and-click adventure could be. Its story is enticingly fresh, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You take on the role of Lorelei, whose story begins in the dark woods outside of a looming manor with little direction beyond a strange invitation to an exhibit there that promises to transcend art itself – one that she might also be a part of? Lorelei and the Laser Eyes prides itself on its obfuscation, rarely giving you a straight answer to any of the questions it raises or telling you what the heck is actually going on – and that’s notable, because it starts at “curiously unexplained” and only gets wilder from there. But that enigmatic attitude never drove me toward frustration over the 13 hours it took me to beat it, always enticing me to uncover the answers for myself in a way that feels natural rather than laborious or obligatory.</p><p>Doing so generally has you directing Lorelei from fixed camera angles as she walks the black and white halls of this manor, bumping up against a cavalcade of locked doors that you’ll slowly but surely figure out how to open. Avoiding spoilers as much as possible, that could involve decoding the meaning behind a nearby poster to decipher the correct combination for a padlock, or it could require circling back much later once you’ve found a key somewhere else. The entire manor is one big puzzle box (with many literal puzzle boxes tucked inside it as well), and figuring out how to move more easily through its halls, which doors to open next, and the right position for each piece to click into place is a consistent thrill. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The entire manor is one big, masterfully assembled puzzle box.&nbsp;</p></div><p>This estate is also a masterfully assembled contraption because it seamlessly weaves in an immense amount of freedom alongside more curated encounters. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is the kind of game that’s a delight to talk about with friends as you compare the physical notes you’ve taken and revel in having solved a particularly tricky challenge – but it’s also a difficult one to discuss, because its relatively open layout means you could be tackling some of its puzzles in very different orders. It strikes an ideal balance between letting you just figure things out and driving you toward key story moments or conversations with its scant cast of characters, all of which are wittily written and tantalizingly obtuse in equal measure. </p><p>The types of puzzles you’ll solve also have an impressive variety to them. Some take the form of literal puzzle books, having you work out straightforward but entertaining number problems to get a solution to an obstacle blocking your path. Others are spatial puzzles that ask you to walk around a room and look at things from a very specific perspective to reveal the answer. Then there are those that will have you deciphering (relatively simple) secret messages in letters or documents, filling your inventory with items and objects that will inevitably be used elsewhere, dialing numbers on a telephone at the manor’s front desk to get outside help, or lots more – many of them asking you to dive into the history of Lorelei herself and the events playing out around her in a way that satisfyingly links all your actions to the compelling story at hand. There are even a few sections that drop you into the spooky, Resident Evil-inspired halls of an in-universe video game, complete with PlayStation-era graphics and hilariously clunky tank control movement.</p><p>However, that joke about the bad controls of olde would be funnier if Simogo hadn’t been so committed to the idea that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes should be a single-button game, a limitation that <em>can </em>be interesting but more often works against it. Apart from moving around with a thumbstick or WASD (and opening the settings), every single button does the same thing: It pulls up your menu when you aren’t near anything, interacts with stuff when you are, selects items in your inventory, cycles through the numbers on combination locks, and attempts to unlock them when you think you have the right answer. There isn’t even a dedicated back button in the menus. While this comparison will come across harsher than I mean it to be, the last game I reviewed to try something like this was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balan-wonderworld-review"><u>Balan Wonderworld</u></a>, and I hate it just as much here as I did there. </p><p>This utterly pointless self-restriction adds unnecessary friction to moving around and solving puzzles. The only way to stop looking at a lock is to intentionally try an incorrect code. If you want to examine an item, book, or note in your inventory while trying to find the right combination, you have to physically step away from the lock before you can access the menu (and if you are in a tight space with other interactable objects, you might walk into their range and select them instead). If you forget where you are going and need to quickly glance at the map, you have to go <em>three </em>menu lists deep before you can then select the map for only a specific floor… and then have to scroll to “exit” buttons on those lists to get back out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Simogo co-founder Simon Flessler said in <a href="https://screenrant.com/lorelei-laser-eyes-interview-challenge-puzzle-simon-flesser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a> that part of the justification for this control scheme was to make Lorelei and the Laser Eyes as broadly accessible as possible – but while that’s a goal I admire, it’s not one that would be compromised in any way I can see by also including the option to use dedicated buttons that quickly exit an interface or pull up the map. The absence of those basic features by no means ruins the experience of playing this otherwise extremely smartly designed game, and if they are the price I have to pay then so be it, but it is an obnoxious blemish on a moody world I was otherwise completely enthralled by. </p><p>That world is at least captivating enough to smooth over most rough edges. This isn’t a horror game, but it does wear the clothes of one occasionally, putting you on edge and teasing at the terrors that bind its puzzles together. There are only a couple of actual “scares,” and the small handful of outright fail states are very explicitly telegraphed, so you’ll never feel like you got something you didn’t sign up for if you’re mostly interested in carefully considered problem solving. But Lorelei and the Laser Eyes does do a fantastic job of <em>unsettling</em> you as you go, using its beautiful black-and-white visual style with pops of neon to create haunting, abstract imagery that can sometimes be as anxiety-inducing as any monster.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Tom's Favorite Puzzlers</h3><p>A non-comprehensive list of some of my absolute favorite puzzle games.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Exploring Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ forlorn manor feels both familiar and novel. Shoving playing cards and letters and other objects into my pockets in the hopes that they’ll help me decode a lock or solve some mystery down the line would fit right at home with the best of the classic point-and-click adventure game genre, but the lovely, low-fi presentation, eerie story, and creative puzzles wrapped around that are all impressively fresh. An unwavering dedication to being a one-button game adds some unnecessary annoyances, but it doesn’t stop it from being a captivating journey just the same. Like all the best puzzle games, it had me frantically scribbling symbols, numbers, and names on physical pieces of paper just to make sure I left no otherworldly stone unturned.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><p>amazing</p><p>Lorelei and the Lasers Eyes' puzzles are clever, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible.</p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/TomRMarks" title="Tom Marks"><span></span><figcaption><p>Tom Marks</p></figcaption></a></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
