            <p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson has discussed the impact of the SAG-AFTRA actors strike, stating the company doesn't anticipate "any significant short-term impact".
</p>
<p>
Wilson's comments were during a Q&amp;A after its latest earnings call, where an investor questioned the impact of the strike.
</p>
<p>
The CEO replied the company is "working diligently to negotiate at the table" but doesn't expect "near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development" or current live-service games.

<p>
His full quote is as follows (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-video-game-actor-strikes-wont-have-short-term-impact-on-the-company">IGN</a>):
</p>
<p>
"We deeply value our talented actors who are an important part of the work we do to deliver the incredible entertainment experiences that our players enjoy around the world. We're working very closely; this is not an EA-specific situation, this is an industry-specific situation, and we're working diligently to negotiate at the table. The way it works now in terms of our product specifically is that the strike is limited to games commencing production after September 2023, including live service games. So we don't expect any near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we're currently running. That being said, we're committed to continuing to bargain in good faith and are hopeful that the parties can expediently resolve our issues at the bargaining table. But we're not anticipating any significant short-term impact at EA."
</p>
<p>
Members of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted last week to go on strike</a> due to concerns over the use of AI in video games as part of the Interactive Media Agreement.

</p>
<p>
The union has been in negotiations for over a year and a half with a number of major game companies, including EA, but has so far failed to reach a deal.
</p>
<p>
"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."
</p>
<p>
A collective statement from video game producers responded: "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-suggests-gta-6-and-other-games-not-technically-hit-by-strike-could-still-be-impacted">terms of the strike from SAG-AFTRA states</a> all "members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work". As such, "while [non-struck games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>] may not be subject to a strike in the technical sense, their production is also subject to being disrupted by members who don't want to work without the protection of AI terms and who don't want to undermine solidarity with the union," said SAG-AFTRA's chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez.

</p>
<p>
However, it seems Wilson is confident EA's games won't be disrupted in this way.
</p>
<p>
The UK equivalent to SAG-AFTRA, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity, has stated it stands "in solidarity" with the US union</a>, but won't authorise its own strike.

            <p>In case you skipped the headline, I’ll repeat myself. Among the wonderful sights contained in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a>-poking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-great-fluctus">The Great Fluctus</a> are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.</p>

<p>“A very relaxing game to zone out for an hour, all while exploring cozy alien worlds, trading with mutants, rebuilding society and saving the world,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085280/The_Great_Fluctus/">Steam page</a>. “You're on a mission to explore strange new worlds, trade with quirky mutants, and rebuild society.” Said society has fallen to the evils of too much phone, apparently, which I’d say was a bit trite and unimaginative if the trailer hadn’t already convinced me that imagination was in no short supply here.</p>
<p>As you explore, you’ll “form bonds with quirky characters and guide entire civilizations, influencing their future through your choices and quests.” There’s a part in the trailer where you lead a small band of gribblies towards what is maybe a battle? Less interesting to me is the entire story laid out on Steam, which is decidedly a case of “please, say less," but your mileage may vary. Still, I’m a very large sucker for very large frogs, so this one’s a wishlist for me. No release date as of yet, but it looks as if The Great Fluctus is the work of just one developer. Let them cook their space beans, say I.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Once upon a time, my favourite place to write was on trains. Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days spend lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The video game in question is On Track (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836290/On_Track/">Steam link</a>), which isn't a game at all but a productivity booster that consists of a blissful carriage view of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/proteus">Proteus</a>-esque hillsides, lakes and forests. I'm not convinced by "productivity-boosting software" - I think the whole thing is a massive con, frankly. But I'll happily choo choo choose this one.</p>
<p>The productivity element of On Track consists of a to-do list, perched below the window, and a timer. There's optional lo-fi music (no thanks) and Sir Or Madam's Choice of ambient audio - you can make the train louder and even turn up the hubbub from other, unseen passengers. The geography evolves a little as you complete tasks. Expect "surprises", though probably nothing that'll jolt you out of your seat, such as a nudist in a passing locomotive, or finding yourself unexpectedly in the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>.</p>
<p>You can slow down or stop the train at any time to investigate these surprises - ideal for simulating the classic LNER experience of having your journey delayed by 45 minutes, because a solitary potato crisp fell out the rear window of the next train along. Many great novels have been written during such lulls, though so far not by me.</p>
<p>On Track launches today, and will be free to play. Phoenix, Arizona-based developers GigaTank3000 are also the creators of the relatively unchill <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1975380/Kaiju_Catastrophe/">Kaiju Catastrophe</a>, in which you run around procedurally generated SimCities as Godzilla. There's a demo for that - perhaps it'll help you reach inbox zero, if you take Godzilla for a rampage in carefully controlled, endorphin-boosting five minute bursts?

		<p>Grinding Gear Games has posted a small update about the Path of Exile PS5 native client, that the studio confirmed it was developing a few weeks ago. The short version is that the native client is being treated as a new title by Sony, so it has to go through the certification process once again before being approved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile: Settlers of Kalguur Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOX7KZng_OI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its statement, Grinding Gear Games said,<em> “During our GGG Live broadcast a couple of weeks ago, we mentioned working on a native Path of Exile client for PlayStation 5. In this news post we’d like to give you a small update regarding this and when to expect the client to go live. The PlayStation 5 native client is treated as a new title submission on PlayStation 5. It gets all new PlayStation 5 services integrations like party and trophies. This means that we needed to rework some of those systems compared to the PlayStation 4 client and certify them.</em></p>
<p><em>At this moment, the game client itself is finished, but we still need to make some adjustments to satisfy the certification requirements. However, these are minor and should not take long.This also means that the PlayStation 5 client gets a new set of trophies (which are identical to PlayStation 4 trophies) and those will be unlocked automatically when you login to the game.We expect to finish certification within the next few weeks. Thanks for your patience!”</em></p>

            <p>Few acts in games feel quite as gleefully gratifying as removing a knight’s shiny dome with a halberd swing in medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> melee <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chivalry-2">Chivalry 2</a>. In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-room-in-hell-2">No More Room In Hell 2</a> well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”</p>

<p>A live service game gracefully bowing out, in this economy? My liege! “With Chivalry 2, we set out to make the ultimate medieval battlefield game: an unparalleled multiplayer experience that realized our dream of being a warrior on the fields of battle, inspired by classic medieval movie scenes and old tales of glory from history,” wrote Torn Banner in a <a href="https://chivalry2.com/2024/07/30/chivalry-2-the-path-ahead-for-chivalry/">blog post</a> yesterday. “With this final content update delivered to players, we’re excited to focus our efforts and resources on compelling new multiplayer projects, both in the Chivalry universe as well as within terrifying new co-op territory.”</p>
<p>That terrifying new co-op territory is No More Room In Hell 2, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/8-player-co-op-zombie-smasher-no-more-room-in-hell-2-releases-in-early-access-this-october">we last saw</a> at SGF earlier this year. It’s currently slated for release this October, but this won’t mean the end for Chivalry. “We’ve been building our team in number and skillset to take on these following challenges, with a focused effort to ensure that when the next Chivalry title is released, it will utterly blow players away.” Neither has support for Chivalry 2 completely ended, as there'll still be hotfixes and the like.</p>
<p>It’s certainly been a busy few years for Chivalry 2. There’s a <a href="https://trello.com/b/7HnXYjSb/chivalry-2-roadmap-preview">Trello board</a> where you can view the entire history of the game’s roadmap, which totals 11 major content drops, ending with the story conclusion of the Regicide update. Rick Lane <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-peasants-to-kings-the-making-of-chivalry-2">had a chat</a> with Torn Banner around the time of the game’s release, and it seems like the team have basically checked off every wishlist item they had for Chivalry’s 2’s future. Whether they did indeed succeed in making the “best horses ever,” though, I’ll let you decide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She says leaping from Hitman to Project 007 felt natural because they're both essentially "secret agent" titles—which is a genre baked into the DNA of the studio.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Independence for IOI means developing projects without compromise">Independence for IOI means developing projects without compromise</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multi-project studios like IOI require a lot of talent, and Lallier says that once you've welcomed people into the fold, it's vital you leverage them in the right way. "Making games is very hard. I'm not going to lie. So, I think the recipe of success is to be focused on your passion," she explains. On a practical level, that means allowing the teams within IOI to iterate rapidly and without fear. Playing every day. Testing every day. Sharing ideas with colleagues across disciplines and locations. Challenging each other to "find the fun." It's a highly collaborative approach that works because IOI put the foundations in place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, although IOI has studios in multiple locations, Lallier says they're all in timezones that overlap. "You can based in Copenhagen, Malmo, Barcelona, Brighton, or Istanbul and working across the same project," she says. "That's how we are divided, but if you look at the geography, we make sure we're all in the same ballpark of timezones. So we don't have people on the West Coast of America and we don't have people in Japan."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She adds that managing your finances as an independent studio is also "critical," and says "lean" spending during the earliest phases of development can help provide a runway for success. Lallier feels those decisions, which might sound mundane on paper, have ultimately given IOI the edge. Notably, she suggests the company was only able to put that plan in place because it's not beholden to the whims of shareholders or a parent company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think studios can suffer when they're on the stock market and so on—when there are big changes happening. All of a sudden you can lose millions and billions, but we don't have this problem," she says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have different challenges as an independent studio, because you might not have the power of a big publisher, but I think the advantage is that the constraints we have are the constraints we can control to some extent. Then we can forecast—we can see how much money we have. How much time we have based on that burn rate. Then we can find ways to still create the thing that makes sense without compromising so much because you have less external influences that you need to handle."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/game-pass-august-2024-lineup-just-got-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following earlier rumors, leaker extas1s has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCN_it98zkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a partial Game Pass lineup for the month of August. Most of the games were previously leaked, but now we have dates. Deck13's Action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-reportedly-coming-to-game-pass-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlas Fallen</a>, for instance, will land on Microsoft's subscription service on August 13, exactly one week after the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reign of Sand update</a>, which is aiming to vastly improve the game in various areas thanks to brand new voice acting, new areas, new enemies, new Essence Stones, a New Game Plus mode, and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard's Crash N.Sane Trilogy was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to join Game Pass. According to extas1s, the remastered collection of the beloved platform franchise will be released on the subscription service on Thursday, August 8.</p>
<p>Just five days later, Game Pass subscribers will get Mafia Definitive Edition, the remake of the classic open world game that marked the beginning of the franchise. 2K has since <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1818376797773500774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-definitive-edition-rumored-to-be-headed-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor</a>, so this addition is actually official now.</p>
<p>These are the biggest new games coming in the month of the August, but there's more on the way. The wave begins on August 6 with SOPA - Tale of the Stolen Potato, an indie adventure game set in South America. The following day, Game Pass users will get to play Creatures of Ava, a so-called creature saver game where players traverse an alien planet, solving environmental challenges and rescuing the native creatures from an infection called 'withering'.</p>
<p>On August 15, the leaked schedule says the subscription service will be updated with Wargroove 2, Chucklefish's acclaimed turn-based tactics sequel released in October 2023. Last but not least, Pugstorm's Core Keeper will be added on Tuesday, August 27. Core Keeper is a 'mining sandbox adventure' game released in March 2022 via early access. It is set in a procedurally generated underground world, borrowing mechanics from the likes of Stardew Valley, Terraria, and Minecraft.</p>
<p>This appears to be the full August Game Pass slate, although extas1s previously said Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 are also coming soon to the subscription service. Moreover, Grand Theft Auto V might <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-reportedly-coming-soon-to-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join</a> PC Game Pass in the near future. Of course, the biggest recent addition was the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p>
<p>Does this lineup convince you to subscribe, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent price increase</a>?</p>

		<p>SEGA has dropped a music video for Sonic X Shadow Generations, giving us a remix of Kingdom Valley Act 1. The music has been remixed by Audissi Studios.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-gaming-ecosystem-has-500-million-monthly-active-users.940956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent financial update, Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, went on file explaining that the company’s gaming arm has ‘over 500 million monthly active users’ (MAU) across all platforms and devices under that umbrella. He also mentioned that the gaming ‘content pipeline’ has “never been stronger”.</p>



<p>This news comes as Microsoft revealed a decline year-on-year of more than 40% in hardware sales, but an uptick in software sales.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-staggering-numbers">Staggering Numbers</h2>



<p>In the financial update <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Microsoft</a>, it was detailed that the firm had seen a growth in revenue in Q4 FY24, and that ‘Xbox Content and Services’ revenue was a huge driver for this, with the sector increasing a whopping 61%.</p>



<p>While speaking about the update, Satya Nadella pointed out that Fallout was the second most-watched series on Amazon Prime <strong>ever</strong>, and that the success of the television series increased “hours played on Game Pass” for the franchise fivefold quarter-over-quarter.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s CFO, Amy Hood, explained that hardware revenue ‘will decline again’, but that loss is being offset by positive results pulled in by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which continues to pay off for Microsoft. </p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A section of the financial call, only one query was aimed at gaming, which Nadella fielded, making key comments about the diversification of Microsoft’s portfolio:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console, and then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had. We feel that now, we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we’re also excited about the new sockets. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are strong expectations for Microsoft’s performance in the coming months.</p>

<p>In the latest wave of claims to hit the content creator space, it was alleged that Kai Cenat’s ‘cameraman’ known as ChrisV had been knowingly messaging a minor in 2021. Per the claims, Chris was inappropriately messaging this individual despite having been told she was only 17 years old.</p>



<p>In an emotional stream segment, Kai recently confirmed that the claims are true to the best of his knowledge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, we’ve seen Dr Disrespect taken down by similar allegations, and MrBeast’s Ava Kris Tyson was cut from his company after several claims surfaced of nefarious acts and behaviour occurring over several years. </p>



<p>Now, Kai Cenat’s team has been hit, with the prolific streamer’s cameraman being targeted by allegations that the creator has confirmed are true. It was reported that ChrisV has been working with Kai Cenat for several years. During a recent stream, Kai Cenat said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This s*** is so f***ing dumb. My cameraman, Chris… In 2021, he got caught talking to a minor who was 17 years old. She lied about her age. She said she was 19, she ended up saying her age, said she was 17. Right at that moment, you’re supposed to stop texting. You can’t have an excuse for this.</p>



<p>I reached out to the person. She showed me every single thing. It’s confirmed. I’m sick and tired of having to do s*** like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While confirming the revelation, Kai Cenat became noticeably emotional and frustrated, slamming his desk and becoming visibly distressed. He questioned why these topics are popping up every few days and announced his complete split from ChrisV, cutting all ties and pushing him as far away as possible. </p>

<p>Twitch is arguably the number-one streaming platform in the world, boasting millions of users and a reported annual revenue of $2 billion – but it’s <strong>still not profitable </strong>for Amazon. In 2014, Amazon acquired the streaming platform for around $1 billion, but more than ten years after that sweeping purchase, it has been revealed that the tech titan <strong>still </strong>isn’t making money from the streaming site.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-always-losing">Always Losing</h2>



<p>This news came from a WSJ report that discussed Amazon’s failure to make money through Twitch after more than ten years of owning and supporting the platform. The cost of running the site through Amazon’s infrastructure means that the firm has failed to ever profit from the streaming platform, despite it pulling in a reported $2 billion a year.</p>



<p>In the report <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published in WSJ</a>, it was claimed that fewer users are signing up to Twitch and the ‘biggest spenders’ are neglecting to pump the site with money. In recent months, Twitch has suffered from widespread layoffs as Amazon has attempted to pivot to adjust to new financial woes that have struck much of the wider industry, and per <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-insiders-fear-mass-layoffs-as-amazon-loses-billions-on-zombie-brand-2844252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, insiders are concerned that another wave is on the horizon.</p>



<p>It was also claimed by those close to Twitch that several projects have been cancelled or postponed internally because there isn’t any hunger or <strong>budget </strong>to float them. </p>



<p>With rising competition in the form of YouTube and Kick and constant complaints from the community about changes to Twitch, the top-tier streaming site could be about to pass a point of no return.</p>

<p>Well, I didn’t have this on my 2024 bingo card.</p>



<p>Today, Wild Assault enters a beta phase on Steam, with players worldwide being invited to soak up all the entertainment offered by this ‘Furry Tactical Shooter’. </p>



<p>That’s right – it’s a third-person shooter aimed at those with <em>special interests</em> in <span><strong>anthropomorphi</strong></span><strong>sed </strong>animals. On the surface, it looks and plays like Fortnite, but it’s a hero shooter, with several animals fulfilling roles that would apply to them if they were suddenly given the ability to wield powerful weapons.</p>



<p>Or something.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-fox-has-breasts">The Fox Has Breasts</h2>



<p>In a new trailer, Wild Assault looked kind of like a run-of-the-mill third-person hero shooter. The animalistic characters that are aimed at ‘furries’ are a little too creepy for me, but it took a hard turn when the ‘fox’ character burst onto the screen with a full-fledged pair of breasts. </p>



<p>The entire host of playable hero characters are humanised creatures of varying types, but <strong>the fox </strong>looks to be the only sexualised character per the trailer.</p>



<p>Here you go:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Wild Assault, which is the debut title from Combat Cat Studio, enters a beta test phase today, which means you can go over to Steam and give it a try for yourself. It’s almost definitely going to fall flat from the moment it hits the market, but for now, we can marvel at how bizarre it is.</p>



<p>Which character are you going to pick? There’s a hulking bear that wields heavy weapons, or perhaps you’ll lean more towards the agile and lithe rabbit with SMG-based gear. How about a skunk with the power to control chemical weapons? The possibilities are (unfortunately) endless.</p>



<p>R34 artists are frothing at the bit.</p>

<p>Elden Ring was made to be one of the most challenging games ever – that much is glaringly obvious. It fits into that niche remarkably well and is arguably the most important game in the category, overpowering the likes of Dark Souls, Sekiro, and perhaps even Bloodborne. However, that fact doesn’t sit well with everyone, and one player in particular has taken that notion farther than anyone else, announcing that they’re seeking legal action against FromSoftware, Elden Ring’s developer.</p>



<p>Why are they suing the legendary game creator? Because Elden Ring is <strong>too hard</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-to-it">More To It</h2>



<p>It goes a little deeper than that, admittedly. At this point, it might also be satire, but the Elden Ring player seems resolute in their desire to sue FromSoftware. The posts online, which were recovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/elden-ring-player-to-sue-fromsoftware-over-high-game-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, talk of content being hidden behind a wall of difficulty that even the most skilled players won’t ever reach, thus making the game either half unplayable or inherently unfair.</p>



<p>It’s a bit wild, admittedly.</p>



<p>Per the posts, the user claims they’re taking FromSoftware (and Bandai Namco) to court on September 25, based on the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My ‘Elden Ring’ lawsuit (that) claims we have only played HALF of FROM SOFTWARE’s games and a whole new game is hidden inside, and that it’s too hard to access for even its most dedicated fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is where it starts to fall apart, with the player stressing that they’ve been turned ‘insane’ because of Hidetaka Miyazaki’s mission to have players ‘break the shackles of humanity’. They then start talking about a parallel universe theory and reference this as having been an issue with other games, like Sekiro. </p>



<p>Do you think there’s a case here, or is this going to be thrown out immediately by the courts?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Xbox isn't the only company seeing a dip in hardware sales, though.</h2></div><section><p>Xbox hardware sales are way down again in Microsoft's Q4, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to the company's acquisition of Activision-Blizzard last year.</p><p>The company posted its earnings today, which included a report of hardware revenue down 42% year-over-year. Hardware sales saw a significant dip of 31% year-over-year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-segment-gets-another-shot-in-the-arm-from-activision-blizzard-in-q3">last quarter as well</a>, though sales were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-earnings-report-activision-blizzard-acquisition">up slightly (3%) in Q2</a> thanks to a series of holiday discounts and promotions. But hardware was also down 7% prior to that in Q1, and yes, <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/SlidesFY23Q4.pptx?version=6e2b873e-6d6a-10c5-ac0b-62f8950909be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropping steadily</a> for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-and-sonys-recent-hardware-sales-reports-tell-very-different-stories">several quarters prior to that</a> too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/07/12/xbox-2-blogroll-1689179393588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox hardware sales are down once again.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For what it's worth, Xbox is far from the only console maker seeing dips in hardware sales. Everyone's impacted, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-drops-the-hardest-as-all-consoles-decline-by-double-digits-compared-to-2023">Circana's most recent report</a>. Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo all say "double-digit percentage declines" in May of 2024, and the Switch saw the most significant drop. This is likely reflective of the fact that all three consoles are on the back halves of their life cycles, and is reflective of fairly normal, cyclical industry trends. Xbox has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update">already confirmed that a "next-gen" console is in the works</a>, and has expressed plans to share more information about hardware of some sort around the holiday season.</p><p>Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records. This is largely due to the boost offered by the acquisition of Activision Blizzard - it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up. Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, this indicates that Xbox's not-Activision-Blizzard-related business isn't doing quiiiiite as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue faired better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year. Microsoft will hold its Q4 earnings call and field questions from investors and analysts shortly.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news was first reported a<a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1817690782460952651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> few days ago</a> by YouTuber eXtas1s, who previously reported <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1817704919475929442" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that Crash Bandicoot N.

Developed by Hangar 13, it is a remake of the 2002 game Mafia. The premise focuses on Tommy Angelo, a former cab driver turned gangster for a crime family in 1930s Illinois. The definitive edition was made from the ground up and features a new game engine, new cutscenes, and tweaks to the gameplay that are similar to Mafia 3. </p><p>In addition to rebuilding the first Mafia game from the ground up, Hangar 13 has taken a point in working on the Mafia series. This includes remastering Mafia 2, which was also released in 2020, and developing Mafia 3 in 2016. In 2022, the studio confirmed it was working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-new-mafia-game-confirmed-to-be-in-development">a new Mafia game</a>, though details on the project have remained scarce since the initial announcement back in 2022. </p><p>"Oozing with 1930s atmosphere, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a successful rejuvenation of the best story in the series," my colleague Luke Reilly penned in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-definitive-edition-review">his review</a> of Mafia: Definitive Edition. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“DaFuq has been in touch, all resolved."</h2></div><section><p>A few days ago, a frankly bizarre internet mystery took root: Garry’s Mod creator Garry Newman revealed that the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But since then, an account purporting to be Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov (DaFuq!?Boom) has said he wasn’t behind the claim, and Newman has told IGN that the manner has been “resolved,” so… all’s well that ends well?</p><p>It all began on Sunday, when Newman posted in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/833983068468936704/833983416390385685/1267223128371630282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>S&amp;Box Discord</u></a> server, “you know what's worse than the nintendo dmca?” He then shared the news about the Skibidi Toilet DMCA, including pasting a screenshot of the letter that he was sent. Interestingly, the copyright holder that the letter is attributed to is <a href="https://inviz.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/image-90-1722369935169.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The letter that Newman was sent on behalf of Skibidi Toilet creator DaFuq!?Boom. (Image credit: Garry Newman/Discord)</figcaption></figure></output><p>The letter that Newman posted specifically cites Skibidi Toilet characters like Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they are "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives has indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p>The letter adds that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared in Discord, “can you believe the cheek?” Skidibi Toilet, of course, is largely made with assets from Half-Life 2, and was originally created in – you guessed it – Garry’s Mod.</p><p>Gerasimov, however, was quick to attempt to set the record straight. An account claiming to be the YouTube creator <a href="https://discord.com/channels/833983068468936704/833983416390385685/1267632589246697553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote in the S&amp;Box Discord</u></a>, “Is there a way to contact Garry? I did NOT strike Garry's Mod and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/boom-1722370090490.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Luckily, according to Newman, Gerasimov did indeed find a way to contact him. When reached by IGN via email, Newman confirmed that they were sent the DMCA late last year. “DaFuq has been in touch, all resolved,” he added.</p><p>So, what did happen here? Was it simply a misguided DMCA sent from an overzealous Hollywood production company? It’s unclear as of now, but DMCA claims sent in error certainly aren’t uncommon.</p><p>IGN has reached out to Gerasimov, Valve (which publishes Garry’s Mod), and Invisible Narratives for more clarification. But for now, it looks like this week’s weirdest internet mystery has been resolved. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Minecraft - Tetris DLC Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the trailer, one of the game modes appears to be standard Tetris, but it has a twist. Instead of placing blocks, players are trapped in the area and are forced to mine their way to the top before getting stuck. As for the dungeon crawling mode, it appears that players will eventually be forced to fight a new mob that's made entirely of Tetris blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">The Tetris DLC is out now and costs 1,510 Minecraft Coins (Minecraft's premium currency), which equates to $9.99. Those who purchase it will also get access to new clothes they can equip on their character.</p><p dir="ltr">If you need additional help in Minecraft, check out our<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-beacon-in-minecraft/1100-6525031/"> guides on how to make a Beacon</a> and an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-an-anvil-in-minecraft/1100-6524993/"> Anvil</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-official-olympics-game-ditched-mario-sonic-in-favour-of-mobile-pc-but-its-also-pushing-nfts.940812/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-official-olympics-game-ditched-mario-sonic-in-favour-of-mobile-pc-but-its-also-pushing-nfts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>For the past couple of decades, the official Olympics video games have starred Mario and Sonic and been exclusive to Nintendo devices. Not so, this year. Olympics Go! Paris 2024 is free-to-play and available for PC via the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>Hear the curl of the monkey's paw? Yeah, it's a mobile game port with the touchscreen prompts seemingly still intact, and its publisher is also pushing a "commemorative Paris 2024 NFT Digital Pin collection".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"They wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," Lee Cocker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">told Eurogamer</a>, regarding the decision to move the series away from Mario and Sonic. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."
</p>
<p>Cocker was involved with several entries in the series while working at ISM Ltd, a firm responsible for managing the Olympic Games video game license.
</p>
<p>Olympics Go! Paris 2024 is consequently now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/olympics-go-paris-2024-5d5f77">available from the Epic Games Store</a>. It includes 12 mini-games, including sports such as archery, 100m sprint, golf and rowing, and the ability to expand Olympic venues with shops, cafés and upgraded statdiums using unlockables earned via competing in events.
</p>
<p>The game is published by nWay, who also own the license for the official Olympics NFT Digital Pin. "You can claim a legendary or epic pin showcasing the Paris 2024 mascot holding a flag and waving. You can add these digital gems to your collection through Magic Eden's friendly NFT marketplace as part of Coinbase's Onchain Summer event. Be sure to have an ETH L2 Base-supported wallet to secure yours today," says the <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/">Olympics Go! website</a>.
</p>
<p>I have a real fondness for Mario &amp; Sonic At The Olympic Games 2020. Its story mode was dismal, but the many, many sports it featured were mostly fun, and I've played dozens of hours of it with family, up to as recently as a few weeks ago. I'd have probably thrown down £50 to buy a 2024 iteration. It's a shame that I now can't, but also that I can't celebrate an official Olympics game arriving on PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-receives-atlus-exclusive-character-showcase.940809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-receives-atlus-exclusive-character-showcase/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date/">newest game developed</a> by Studio Zero and published by ATLUS. Studio Zero is a division of ATLUS that has developed games such as Catherine: Full Body and now the new exciting addition, Metaphor: ReFantazio, its first game since 2016. ATLUS is the mastermind behind franchises such as Shin Megami Tensei and Persona.</p>
<p>In a brand-new character showcase, players are introduced to some of the rivals and allies they can expect to meet in this new universe. The showcase uploaded to YouTube via Official ATLUS West is 18 minutes long and has a disclaimer that the footage shown is a mixture of in-game footage and footage developed for the sake of a trailer.</p>
<p>The video focuses on the protagonist, a character who is participating in the Royal Tournament but also finds himself at the bottom of the social ladder. The Royal Tournament is an event where all participants vie for kingly power. The protagonist is unlikely to be king simply based on his personality and social status.</p>
<p>In this video, the director Katsura Hashino of Metaphor: ReFantazio introduces some of the characters and explains ways in which the protagonist can increase his favor and popularity with the people. Hashino describes the way that social bonds with specific characters can affect the abilities and archetypes your protagonist will have, which can allow the protagonist to become stronger over time depending on what relationships you choose to build on.</p>
<p>The King is introduced very early into the game, before the protagonist attends his funeral. Once that happens, the King's face appears in the sky, and sets the challenge of winning the most favor in order to become king, in an event called "Tournament for the Throne." To try and gain favor, the candidates have to travel to each major city within the Kingdom to try and win favor from the citizens, and try to prove why they are worthy of being king.</p>
<p>To win favor, they have to compete in challenges. One of these challenges is called the "Exhibition of the Brave" where candidates have to try and bring in the biggest monster head they can. For those who fail, they will be eliminated from the competition, which can include the protagonist if they fail the challenges given to them.</p>
<p>While they haven't given specific dates, there will be more live streams on the ATLUS West YouTube channel where they do further deep dives into the game's development and what players can expect going forward. For now, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3MUxQ5QT5RQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character showcase</a> on their YouTube channel to learn more about the beginnings of the story, and what you can expect from some of the characters in the game.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.
</p>
<p>Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a> machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Newman shared a screenshot of the alleged DMCA notice on his <a href="https://discord.com/channels/833983068468936704/833983416390385685/1267223543100346369">S&amp;box Discord channel</a>.
</p>
<p>"Significant revenue is being generated by unathorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere. There is absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, Garry's Mod content related to Skibidi Toilet." The notice goes on to cite characters such as "Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, Titan TV Man, and Skibidi Toilet" as property of the copyright holder Invisible Narratives. "Can you believe the cheek," as Newman noted on Discord.
</p>
<p>If you don't have children or very young teenagers in your life, you might not be familiar with Skibidi Toilet, a series of 3D animations best known for early episodes in which a singing head which emerges from a toilet. If you have seen them, and you're a tired millenial like me, you probably spotted that the head sure looks like a City 17 resident, and the toilet like something you would have fired at a Combine soldier from the tip of your Gravity Gun.</p>
<p>YouTuber Alexey "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsSsgPaZ2GSmO6il8Cb5iGA">DaFuq!?Boom!</a>" Gerasimov, who currently has 43 million subscribers, makes no secret of these inspirations, often crediting Garry's Mod community assets in the video descriptions. Gerasimov also appeared on the S&amp;box Discord after the DMCA began to circulate in the hope of getting in touch with Newman. "I did NOT strike Garry's Mod and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!", he wrote.
</p>
<p>It wouldn't be surprising if lawyers, on behalf of the production company Invisible Narratives, acted without Gerasimov's knowledge. It also wouldn't be a surprise if the entire thing was fake - the DMCA system is ripe for abuse and it wouldn't be the first time Garry's Mod has received takedown notices pretending to be from a company that wasn't at all involved. The typo in "unathorized" doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
</p>
<p>I will make sure to keep on top of the situation and update this story should there be any breaking Skibidi news.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Wildermyth, the acclaimed procedural storytelling RPG from developer Worldwalker Games, is - after three years revelling in its many accolades garnered while exclusive to PC - coming to Switch, PlayStaton, and Xbox on 22nd October this year.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, Wildermyth is pretty familiar stuff, taking players on a fantasy flavoured adventure of party based levelling and tactical turn-based combat. Those bits are all perfectly good, but the real cleverness starts with its procedurally generated story, where campaigns are cunningly, convincingly assembled from beautifully illustrated, wonderfully written narrative fragments and choose-your-own-adventure-style scraps.
</p>
<p>
And <em>that</em> all builds out from your highly customisable party of characters, who each get distinctly defined traits, personalities, histories, and abilities. And each of <em>them</em> can forge alliances, develop rivalries, fall out, fall in love, die and be reborn is a constantly swirling maelstrom of variables that keep things fresh. And that's without factoring in some of other clever stuff, like the way your journey - passing in days, months, and years - unfolds across a dynamic world map that evolves, not always positively, depending on your actions.

It's a real treat - but if you're looking for a more formal recommendation of Wildermyth's brilliance, Christian Donlan called it a "dazzling game of tactics and narrative, choices, and memories" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wildermyth-review-a-proper-rpg-marvel">slapped an Essential badge on it</a> back in 2021.
</p>
<p>
"I love the way Wildermyth embraces huge stretches of time," Christian wrote, "not just the time it takes to build a bridge - tricky if you have to complete a chapter before the summer's gone - but in the way that between chapters of the adventure you earn years of peace, and then you get to see what happens to your players during that peace. By the end of a yarn, you have been through things with these characters, and crucially they have changed. They're older. They've known love and loss. Granted, some of them are now wolves. Some of them even have pets!"
</p>
<p>
Wildermyth for consoles features everything seen on PC - including co-operative multiplayer for up to five friends - alongside a reworked UI designed with gamepad in mind. It'll be available digitally when it comes to Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd October this year, and a physical edition is also in the works for PlayStation and Switch.

It seemed to make all the right moves, using <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> to jump start online multiplayer into the soon-to-be dominant form of gaming, while investing it all back into indie curation, big exclusives, and marketing deal that made the console feel like the place everyone had to be. </p><p>In some ways it felt like the best of all worlds, and by the end of the generation you could pick up an Xbox 360 for just $100 and play dozens of the best games ever made. The culture was far from healthy, and some of the places making everything were a mess to work for. But it was also a fun time, and a weird one. Here’s what we’ll miss about it and why the Xbox 360 still feels so special to us. </p><hr><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-remember-some-xbox-360-games-1826905842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-remember-some-xbox-360-games-1826905842">Let’s remember some Xbox 360s</a></span>! What’s your Xbox 360 origin story Carolyn?</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> The first E3 I ever attended was in 2005, with the Xbox 360's launch still some months out and I have to say, the games I saw on the show floor looked amazing. It’s hilarious to me now considering I haven’t even thought about this game in probably 15 years, but at that time, the game that blew me away the most was probably <em>GRAW</em>. Interestingly, though, despite my initial excitement about the console being rooted in its graphical power and my lust for next-gen spectacle, now, when I think back on what made the console so special to me, it’s not really about that aspect of it at all. What about you Alyssa?</p><p><strong>Alyssa Mercante:</strong> I’ve told mine on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://kotaku.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://kotaku.com/" target="_blank">Kotaku.com</a></span> more than once, but I had borrowed my high school sweetheart’s original Xbox to play <em>Halo 2</em> when he went away to college, but not long after that <em>Halo 3</em> came out, which wasn’t backwards compat. So I went out during my free period in high school (we had an open campus for seniors, you could take your car and leave if you didn’t have class), and drove to a Target where I spent my summer job savings on a 360, <em>Halo 3</em>, and Xbox Live. </p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I have zero recollection of the Xbox 360's launch. What was I even doing at the time? 2005. Hmm. I was going into my senior year in high school, barely playing anything except for the occasional late-stage PS2 game—<em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</em>, followed eventually by <em>Okami </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>. My only real memory of the beginning of that console cycle is my brother getting a PS3 and me having almost no interest in it. It wasn’t until my girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend in college got me hooked on <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> that I finally picked up a super cheap used Xbox 360 arcade edition for like $150. That four years after the console launched but still somehow only the mid-way point.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a1b48d9830f2ccb258bd262ca1b47c8" data-recommend-id="image://0a1b48d9830f2ccb258bd262ca1b47c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1437" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepherd interrogates a suspect.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Yeah, I don’t remember exactly when I finally got one myself—I certainly couldn’t afford one at launch, and my memories of the time around release have a lot to do with playing Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie (lol) at GameStop kiosks.<br></p><p><strong>Moises Taveras: </strong>The first time I ever played an Xbox 360 also had to do with <em>Call of Duty: MW2</em>. It was all the rage with the kids in my middle school, but I was largely looking from the outside in as a) a PlayStation kid since my youth and b) someone who came from a family too poor to afford more than one console. But eventually, I made friends who had 360s and I remember us all cramming onto a couch in the smallest bedroom imaginable at our friend Howard’s house and playing local multiplayer matches till we lost our voices from shouting. I learned really quickly then that the 360 was synonymous with multiplayer and socializing with folks and it made me want one so bad. Little did I know I wouldn’t get a 360 till the very end of the console generation!</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I think part of the Xbox 360's dominance in that era can be attributed to the fact that it offered the best online experience for folks wanting to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, but it also did something incredible that totally won over people like me. I’m not saying I didn’t have an amazing time playing Gears of War co-op, I absolutely did, and huge credit to Microsoft for putting out a steady stream of banger exclusives that really made Xbox Live feel essential. But for me, when I think about the Xbox 360, what still gets me excited most is Xbox Live Arcade, and particularly amazing games like <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em>. Games like this took the arcade leaderboard competition of my childhood and absolutely exploded it. Suddenly I was staying up nights pouring everything I had into beating my friends’ high scores on online leaderboards for all the world to see. Man, it was incredible. </p><p><strong>Moises:</strong> Supergiant Games’ Bastion absolutely blew my mind as far as what I thought games could be. It being a console exclusive to the 360 through XBLA broke my heart and kept me from the portfolio of what’d become my favorite studio, and then Xbox just kept pumping out indie titles like it. Honestly, my working definition of an indie game was largely informed by this era of XBLA games.<br></p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> The Xbox 360 was the first console launch I was really tuned into the industry for. I was full-blown sicko mode for that thing as a kid, and was counting down the days. I was a huge Rare fan at the time and Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero were a huge deal to me. But broadly, I think I fell off video games for a bit because the system just didn’t speak to my tendencies. As Moises said, the 360 became the multiplayer system and I preferred gaming in solitude, and eventually pivoted to the PS3 in the final years of that generation. But I played the <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy on the 360, so I ended up keeping an old 360 in my home longer than any other system. I had to replace the household 360 more times than probably any other system my family owned. </p><p>We got a launch window system that died by the time <em>Halo 3 </em>came out, so we had to replace it swiftly. Then I got my own 360 for Christmas 2009, just before the launch of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. That sucker lasted over a decade. It gathered dust for large swaths of the time, but since I didn’t own an Xbox One, it was the only way for me to go back to my old <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy saves until the Legendary Edition came out in 2021. So while I had mostly abandoned the system by the end of the generation, the 360 is still a defining system in my life because it gave me one of the most important video game experiences of my life. I’ll always be grateful for it, even if I think the Microsoft was a trailblazer for some of the industry’s worst modern tendencies with it.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>That was the other thing that I think tipped me in the direction of the Xbox 360 besides the price and walled multiplayer gardens. As someone coming from the PS1 and PS2, it just had more of the RPGs I was craving earlier or in better condition. I came to the original Mass Effect late but it blew my mind. I got to catch up on Star Wars: The Old Republic. It was synonymous with retro and couch-coop indie games for me like Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy. It really did just nail a lot of the same things that the PS4 did a generation later and which ultimately helped Sony to reverse the tide.</p><p><strong>Moises: </strong>it’s so weird to think about now given Xbox’s current situation and catalog, but the 360 was where all the games were!</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Another thing that was a big factor for me, I have to admit, is that I was totally cheevo-pilled. The Xbox 360 brought about the advent of achievements and I got extremely excited about pulling off absurd things like beating Call of Duty campaigns on Veteran to get all the achievements. I no longer put much stock in achievements or trophies, but to this day I greatly prefer the at-a-glance number that reflects your achievements compared to all the trophies of PlayStation’s system. And on top of that, the whole interface on Xbox just felt so much more inviting to me than that on Sony. I think avatars were really smart of them to introduce in that era. I loved signing on and seeing little cartoon versions of all my good friends online, playing games of their own. In comparison to that, the whole interface of the PS3 just felt cold and impersonal to me, and that console would end up gathering dust in my entertainment center. </p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>The Xbox 360 home screen definitely felt a lot more inviting and hit that sweet spot of clutter to chill. The controller was also very solid. Have any of you gone back and tried to hold a PS3 DualShock? It feels like you’re being pranked. I take it none of you ever had an issue with red-ringing or other hardware failures?</p><figure id="" data-id="053b350687da112b96f901d6156a7a08" data-recommend-id="image://053b350687da112b96f901d6156a7a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1995" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="People attend a midnight release for Halo 3.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Moises:</strong> Nope! Correct me if I’m wrong but those issues got ironed out with later iterations of the console, so by the time one of my best friends let me indefinitely borrow his 360, it was smooth sailing for me.<br></p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I did have to send mine back for repairs once, and for a while there at least, it felt like everyone I knew who owned one was hitting the red ring. There was a period there, at least in my circle of friends, where there was real disbelief and anger that Microsoft had sold us all a product that was so prone to failure. I think it speaks to just how fond people were overall of the console—its library, its interface, its online features—that today, when you bring it up, you’re far more likely to get fond recollections than bitter complaints. It was so good that even the considerable irritations so many of us experienced with it are now just a footnote in our memories.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>My console ended up red-ringing in like, 2012? But then I read that you can just put it in the oven and bake it at a low temperature to loosen up the glue. Has worked like a charm ever since.</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Wow, I never knew that!</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I think one of the reasons people look back so fondly on the Xbox 360 is that, in retrospect, it felt like the last time you could contain the entirety of what was going on, coming out, and being talked about in your head at any given time. It was still very intimate and physical, with midnight launches and stacks of controllers in the split-screen coop session. There was spectacle with E3 but also the feeling you alone were discovering these incredible hidden treasures on Xbox Live Arcade, which was like a return to finding the internet for the first time again.</p><p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> I agree. And they just had so many games that became sensations for a time, from <em>Braid</em> to <em>Geometry Wars</em>. The curation was exceptional, and it was an era in which it still felt like the whole culture, or much of it at least, could still come together for a few weeks around some exciting new downloadable game.</p><p><strong>Moises: </strong>Yeah. By comparison, when the PS4 really started to pivot to those smaller more intimate games early in its lifetime, it wasn’t that those games were lesser, but it did feel like they were being more haphazardly thrown on the platform to fill gaps between big exclusives. Meanwhile XBLA had these clearly thought out rollouts and events that made a big deal of Arcade titles. Also everything was less shitty. Xbox Live Gold was the original multiplayer subscription, and the only one for quite some time, but it at least seemed to provide value with great deals and a platform that produced rock solid multiplayer hits. It also wasn’t as expensive as anything is nowadays.</p><p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Before we wrap things up here, I think we can’t talk about what an amazing console the 360 was without saying a little more about its games. Are there any games y’all want to shout out as particular favorites that really helped make that library great or were emblematic of what the console was doing? When I think about the 360, I think about how the grittiness of <em>Gears of War</em> coexisted harmoniously alongside the whimsy of <em>Viva Pinata</em>, and I’ll never forget the dozens of hours my friends and I spent driving around doing challenges together in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>. It really did feel, more than a lot of other consoles, like it offered something for everyone, and like the people behind it thought deeply about how to bring people together to share in the experiences it offered.</p><p> And even though some of its games were also on PlayStation, at least everyone in my friend group, won over by the cheevos and online features of Xbox, always bought multiplatform games there, which perpetuated the console’s dominance in that generation. It’s a little wild to think how this generation it feels somewhat the opposite for me, like most people I know play most multiplatform games on PlayStation. Wild how the tables have turned. But yeah, any other 360 shoutouts? </p><p><strong>Moises: </strong>I cannot separate the 360 from the stunning role it did in promoting so many smaller studios to the mainstream. I already invoked Bastion from Supergiant Games, but I can’t not shoutout Limbo and Playdead, which has now delivered two absolutely singular game experiences in a row. Oh and Shadow Complex does still own.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong><em>Limbo </em>was incredible. While the indie darling backlash was fair and warranted, it was really an incredible run of curation there for several years. <em>The Dishwasher</em> games were great, and really spoke to that sense of Newgrounds 2.0 animating the grungy vibe of XBLA. It’s also wild how much Microsoft tried to court Japanese RPG fans with<em> Blue Dragon</em> and<em> Lost Odyssey</em>. For me personally, <em>Dungeon Defenders</em> is still an all-time great. One of the last times I was able to rope friends into playing something for hours with me on a couch.</p><p>I was trying to think of my top five favorite 360 games, exclusive or no, and couldn’t stop listing stuff. The end of that console generation was so strong, on both 360 and PS3, maybe there’s hope that the Series X/S and PS5 pick up in their final years. But with massive budgets, long development times, and so much risk-averse consolidation, I’m not hopeful.</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Whether it picks up to some degree or not, I think it’s safe to say that there will never be an era quite like that exemplified by the 360 again. The console was just perfectly poised to take advantage of a given moment in gaming culture and technology, employing exciting new ideas like achievements to build a sense of both community and friendly competition around games in ways that its library and online service leveraged brilliantly. Also, Sneak King was great.</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Any parting thoughts since you vanished, Alyssa?</p><p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> LMAO. The time my 360 red ringed right before I went up for senior year of college. The day before. And I went out and bought another because not having one wasn’t an option. That or the time my mother heard me cursing out misogynists in Italian?</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Was it on the $3 phone bank operator Xbox 360 headset?</p><p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Beninteso!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 has surpassed expectations with over 5 million unique players during its first week of availability.</p>



<p>EA <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made the announcement</a> as part of its earnings call for Q1 of fiscal year 2025 on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“After the quarter ended, EA Sports College Football 25 welcomed 5 million unique players<br>into the game through its first week, with over 500,000 more playing via the EA Play trial,” EA said via release. </p>



<p>Because the closing of the quarter came after the game’s release, revenue generated from College Football 25 won’t be reported until Q2 FY2025 results come in a few months. As far as what to expect, however, it’s quite astounding.</p>



<p>As previously reported by Insider Gaming, EA was internally hoping to hit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-sees-over-2-million-players-before-full-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-$100 million in revenue</a> for College Football 25 to be considered a success. The expectation has been far surpassed with estimates based off information I’ve gathered from sources putting revenue at over $500 million. It’s worth noting that the estimates don’t include an exact breakdown of Deluxe Editions at $99.99 vs Standard Editions at $69.99. It also doesn’t include any specific information from College Ultimate Team.</p>



<p>I had texted a source about the state of sales after the first week. On July 26, the response was pretty straight forward.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Texted a source about College Football 25 sales a week after full release.</p><p>Immediate response: "Holy shit.

</div></figure>



<p>“Holy ****. The franchise is set up for the future,” the source said.</p>



<p>Based on those first-week player numbers, it’s safe to say they’re right.</p>

<p>EA has released its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2025, and the publisher is continuing to pull in money. </p>



<p>EA announced that for the first quarter alone, the company had net bookings of $1.262 billion. That amount surpassed the anticipated amount of $1.25 billion.</p>



<p>“EA delivered a strong start to FY25, beating net bookings guidance as we continue to execute across our business,” said Andrew Wilson, CEO of EA, via press release. </p>



<p>As far as the catalysts for the high earnings, EA says it was “stronger performance across Madden NFL 24, FC Online and FC Mobile.”</p>







<p>Regarding net revenue, EA hit $1.66 billion for the first quarter. Looking forward to the second quarter of FY2025, EA expects net revenue to be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. For the rest of the year, EA says net revenue should fall between $7.1 and $7.5 billion. </p>



<p>For FY2025, EA still has numerous major releases including Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Madden NFL 25, EA Sports FC 25, and NHL 25.</p>
