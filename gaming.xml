			<p>The Witcher creator Andrzej Sapkowski never really hid his utter disdain for gaming in general. This was perhaps only exacerbated by the famous dispute with Polish developer CD Projekt RED: originally, the author sold the videogaming rights for a relative pittance, thinking they would never really be that successful. </p>



<p>Following The Witcher III: Wild Hunt's immense success, however, Sapkowski <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded $16 million in royalty payments</a> despite the fact that the deal they had previously struck did not mention any royalty fees at all. Eventually, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a new agreement with the creator of The Witcher</a> that purportedly satisfied both parties.</p>



<p>Now, though, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh Reddit AMA on the Fantasy subreddit</a>, Sapkowski returned to criticize CD Projekt's games, specifically on their 'completely unnecessary' expansion of the concept of Witcher schools. Here's the relevant quote:  </p>



<p><em>The issue of "witcher schools" requires—I apologise—a longer explanation. A single sentence about some "school of the Wolf" mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these "witcher schools." Completely unnecessary.</em></p>



<p><em>I'm still uncertain about what to do with this situation. Perhaps, taking the path of least resistance, I'll erase the sentence about the "school" from future editions of The Last Wish. Or maybe I'll want to expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books? Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit.</em></p>



<p>It is quite obvious that Sapkowski never played CD Projekt's The Witcher games, as their schools are really nothing like Harry Potter's Houses. Anyway, the writer later replied to a question about adaptations in general, once again claiming the inherent superiority of the written word to images, 'animated or otherwise':</p>



<p><em>Regardless of the quality of these adaptations, there are no dependencies or points of convergence between the literary original and its adaptation. The original stands alone, and every adaptation stands alone; you can't translate words into images without losing something, and there can't be any connections here. Moreover, adaptations are mostly visualisations, which means transforming written words into images, and there is no need to prove the superiority of the written word over images, it is obvious. The written word always and decidedly triumphs over images, and no picture - animated or otherwise - can match the power of the written word.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Sapkowski is entitled to his opinion, though it clearly appears to stem from a strong bias. For its part, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still plans to incorporate some concepts from the author's latest book</a>, Crossroads of Ravens, in the upcoming game The Witcher IV (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't be released before 2027</a>).</p>

<figure data-uuid="bd12a019bd879"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd12a019bd879/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is out this week, and in case you missed it, it comes with all sorts of enhancements. Apart from the resolution boost on the Switch 2, the game also supports the system's Joy-Con 2 mouse mode feature, which is a welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Before you jump in and try this out, there's one thing you might want to know. This mode can only be accessed in the 'Co-Star Mode' with a second player. Here's the full rundown about this from our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Co-Star Mode’ makes a welcome return for those who wish to bring a friend on board to help gather Star Bits or defeat enemies. Player Two waggles their Joy-Con about to move the onscreen cursor, but if you’re on Switch 2, you can also use the console’s mouse functionality, and it works wonderfully. Chances are you’ll play both games solo, but it’s a nice little extra regardless."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890ophsqi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you were hoping to experience mouse mode on a single-player run, it seems you're out of luck. You'll need to call on a friend, family member, or someone else if you want to properly test it out. Once again, this control mode in these new versions is only accessible to Switch 2 users.</p>
<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be made available on 2nd October, with fans also able to purchase each game separately from the Switch eShop.</p>

The standard TV Soundbar, meanwhile, doesn’t include a subwoofer but is a nice step up from most built-in TV speakers.</p><p><strong>Amazon Fire TV Streaming Devices</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a> -- $18 (<del>$35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Cube</a> -- $100 (<del>$140</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Soundbar-speaker-Virtual/dp/B0C4BZ28PG?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Soundbar</a> -- $90 (<del>$120</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Soundbar-channel-design/dp/B0CXZTT4MT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Soundbar Plus</a> -- $150 (<del>$250</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-alexa-voice-remote-pro/dp/B09RX4HKTD?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote</a> -- $25 (<del>$35</del>)</li></ul><p>And if you want some movies to watch on your new 4K TV, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-4k-blu-ray-best-deals/1100-6535093/" data-ref-id="1100-6535093">Amazon has a bunch of 4K Blu-rays for $15 or less</a> as part of its early Prime Big Deal Days sale.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-4k-blu-ray-best-deals/1100-6535093/">Get Popular Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For $15 Or Less At Amazon This Week</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Drops To All-Time Best Price For Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shinings-new-4k-steelbook-edition-is-back-in-stock-at-walmart-releases-next-week/1100-6534223/">The Shining's New 4K Steelbook Edition Is Back In Stock At Walmart, Releases Next Week</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-mario-kart-deals-available-at-amazon/1100-6534885/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle In Stock At Amazon With Same-Day Delivery</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-amazon-exclusive-edition-is-in-stock-on-launch-day/1100-6532225/">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Amazon-Exclusive Edition Is In Stock On Launch Day</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> this week, Nintendo has released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> on the Switch.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo's official support page, Version 1.2.2 addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience. It doesn't go into any details beyond this, but if we find out what is going on behind the scenes here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Compatibility with existing versions is also noted, so be mindful of that. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Ver. 1.2.2 (Released September 30, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Note: Does have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.2.1-1.1.0. Does not have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.0.0. Please be careful of the update version on each player’s system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major update for this same title in June</a>, which optimised the game's visuals and frame rate for the Switch 2. It also added HDR support in Bowser's Fury and a GameShare option.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the original release on Switch in our review here on Nintendo Life. Bowser's Fury is also well worth a look, if you haven't already given it a go.</p>

<p>Expect improved FPS, load times and more</p>

<figure data-uuid="d04ea720d106d"><a title="Warframe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d04ea720d106d/warframe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Extremes (via Steam)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, the team at Digital Extremes provided a development update on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a> - confirming a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the free-to-play title was officially in the works.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent developer livestream, the team has shared the first gameplay footage from this particular build of the game, now that they've finally got their hands on some dev kits. It highlights faster load times, higher shading quality, improved frame rate, and more.</p>

<p>You can see a little <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2575538613">more gameplay footage</a> in the official stream around the 28-minute mark. Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair reiterates how the load times are much shorter than the Switch counterpart, and also notes how this new version of the title will apparently target 60fps in docked mode.</p>
<p>There's no information just yet about when exactly the Switch 2 version of Warframe will be released, but when we hear more, we'll be sure to let you know. Warframe was made available for the original Switch in 2018. The port specialists at Panic Button helped out with this version of the game at the time, and we labelled it a "remarkable technical feat" for Nintendo's hybrid system.</p>

You two very specific groups of people need to know that I spent the entire weekend playing<em> Town To City </em>and did little else, because I couldn't stop playing <em>Town To City</em>.</p><p>It's a game that shows the people of its world, much like our own, tired of the brutalities of modern industrial life and yearning for greener pastures. So it puts you in charge of those pastures, a town where a steady stream of treechangers arrive at a train station seeking a new life, and it's your job to first build them a house, and then put them to work.</p><p>Zooming out to survey everything you're able and asked to do in this game, <em>Town To City </em>looks like a city-builder. People's homes and jobs create numbers which then impact other stuff, there is happiness to worry about, warehouses to distribute resources to and from and shopfronts which draw on a complicated supply network of farms and granaries that you're given full control over. If your idea of city-building is to get lost in the numbers, managing a settlement's nerve centre and making sure its connections and creations all intertwine and sing in harmony, <em>Town To City </em>absolutely lets you play like that.</p><p>Zoom in, though, and there are huge sections of <em>Town To City</em> where you're not really city-building at all, and everything feels closer to<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a> or <em>Townscaper</em> than <em>SimCity</em>. Through a combination of the game's flexible voxel graphics and a creation suite more interested in painting than laying along grids, <em>Town To City </em>lets you spend countless hours just...being creative. I lost track of the amount of time I spent making little bendy roads up hillsides, planting little hedge parks in between houses, putting flowerpots on people's balconies and planting flags where needed, not because it was important (though it can be, because your inhabitants’ happiness is linked to the aesthetics of their neighbourhood), but just because I thought it looked nice.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Town to City | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMXIUgRoqTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>What makes the game so good is the way both these halves politely respect each other's contributions and boundaries. If four families arrive in town at once and need somewhere to live, you obviously need to build them a house, but if you want to spend an hour designing the perfect cul de sac for them all first, planting every decorative shrub in their yards and agonising over the placement of every single lamp adorning their walls, you can do that. They won't complain, or get cold, or <em>starve</em>, or leave; they'll just patiently wait for you to be done, <em>then </em>you can move them in.</p><p>Unpopular shops won't lead to crime, unhappy people don't riot, empty houses don't rot or catch fire. You're basically never hassled. This isn't the real world, these aren't real people, the game knows these are dolls with some needs. You're here to build a dollhouse, and if it takes you three hours to get a family out of the cold and into a farmhouse then they're not only cool with it, they'll appreciate your effort once you do.</p><p>For me, this is everything that's good about city-builders (a sandbox, a plaything, a set of numbers to mess around with) and nothing I hate about them (the stress of having bad things happen to you or the things you make). It creates a frictionless experience; you're always building but never having to rework (unless you want to!), always expanding but never circling back because you made a logistical mistake.</p><figure><figcaption>I made everyone a nice little park, not because I had to, just because it's nice</figcaption></figure><p>The game's dual focus--the grander designs of your town at one end of the zoom lens, the <em>Sims</em>-like attention to each individual household at the other--made me prouder of my towns than I think I've ever been of any town or city, in any game, ever. I had made all of it. From the widest boulevard outside a towering cathedral to the placement of each park bench and individual flowerpot.</p><p>For a game with such a chill vibe, I felt strangely all-powerful, more godlike than I'd felt playing games where I'd been a literal god. Though not in a cackling, vengeful god way; just a warm, glowing, benevolent way, like I was putting in six days of work before I could rest on the seventh and watch everyone go buy some eggs and play hopscotch.</p><p>Does all this cosiness and coddling rob the game of any sense of peril? Of course it does. If you're into games like <a href="https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Frostpunk</em></a><em> </em>because you like the feeling of playing a video game with a gun to your head, you might hate <em>Town To City</em>. It's more polite than Canadians lining up at a line shop, and I suppose there's an argument that at some level a city-builder requires some element of threat, otherwise it just becomes a game about building stuff.</p><p>But that's exactly what I love about <em>Town To City</em>. It gives me the systems of a city-builder but the elegance of a town-painter, the challenge of juggling morale but letting you cheese your way to improving it by drowning your residents in dogs and fancy clothing stores. It's given me everything I love from this genre and tossed out everything I don't, then played some wonderfully soothing accordion music over the top, just for good measure.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Town To City</em> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115220/Town_to_City/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out in Early Access on Steam</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoSEA/status/1973055352355922041">on social media this week</a>, the company revealed sales of the title would end on 1st November 2025.

<p>When this paid "online-only" experience was released on the eShop, we gave it five out of ten stars and raised concerns at the time about how long it would remain active. It followed the original release of <strong>Pac-Man: Mega Tunnel Battle</strong> on Google Stadia in 2020.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review-2025.1313077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a life-long lover of sci-fi battle scenes, it is always a joy to order a fleet of dozens of starships of all shapes and sizes to hyper-jump to a neighboring planet, then zoom in and watch as they burst into existence on the other side, bearing down on the entrenched enemy as they scramble fighters and bring their guns to bear. It’s something we’ve seen play out many times in Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and more, though few games let you control warfare between interstellar powers on the scale of Sins of a Solar Empire 2. It often takes hours of slow and steady management across layers of intimidatingly complex grand strategy systems to build up to those major confrontations, but the payoff is spectacular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The important thing to know going in is that while this is a bewilderingly complicated real-time strategy/4X hybrid that lets you zoom from a view of an entire solar system down to an individual spaceship in a fleet of hundreds, you do not need to know everything about it to have a good time with it, or even win. I should know – after a few dozen hours playing largely against Unfair (the setting above hard) AI opponents, mostly in four-way free-for-alls, I’ve won more than I’ve lost even though I still have a lot to learn about the many, many differences both large and subtle between the six playable factions and how their fleets, structures, and upgrades interact. Unless you’re in this to mostly play at a high level against human opponents who’ve optimized their build orders and mastered the mechanics, once you get your head around the basics of building your economy, research, and fleet management, I’ve found that you can lean into the aspects that you enjoy most and all but ignore things you aren’t interested in, and still enjoy building your empire and crushing enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sins of a Solar Empire 2 Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fundamentally, all six of Sins 2’s playable factions operate in a fairly similar way in that they all colonize planets, extract resources, build orbital structures for research and production, and have similar lineups of corvettes, frigates, cruisers, and capital ships, but beyond that their differences are significant and complex as hell. The two human TEC factions both generate money in part by setting up networks of trading outposts, but they come with different upgrades and bonuses that makes Enclave better suited for a defensive playstyle and Primacy more aggressive – among them, the Novalith Cannon superweapon that can bombard planets from across the solar system and the ability to earn money by sending in raiders. The Vasari Alliance, meanwhile, have no use for the TEC’s money at all and are focused on diplomacy with minor factions that let them periodically call in favors like reinforcements or upgrades, while their Exodus counterparts are the only faction that can completely destroy planets as they strip them for resources. The Advent Reborn and Wrath are big on resurrecting destroyed ships and mind-controlling enemies, respectively. All of that is a gross oversimplification, of course, but in the interest of avoiding turning this review into a mirror of the <a href="https://wiki.sinsofasolarempire2.com/space/SSEFW/1684832258/Guides" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>massive guides to each faction</u></a> on the official site, rest assured that they’re pretty distinct. The list of unique technologies and items they all have access to means there’s a lot of replayability here just from trying out each one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It really does look spectacular when major battles are joined and the lasers and missiles start flying.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you played the classic 2008 Sins of a Solar Empire (or its half-step sequel Rebellion) Sins 2 may seem a bit unambitious when you first begin – at least, after you’ve stopped gawking at how much better and shinier all the ships look in an updated game engine that can handle cool things like all the rotating, target-tracking turrets you could ask for. It really does look spectacular when major battles are joined and the lasers and missiles start flying, but it takes a while to get to that point. The early hours of Sins 2 play very similarly to its 17-year-old predecessor: the routine of starting from a single world, exploring the map around you with automated scouts, and racing to colonize every planet and asteroid you can clear of local defenses with your chosen starting flagship and small fleet (as you research the technologies required to inhabit each planet type) is for the most part indistinguishable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main new wrinkle is presented by an exotic materials system that limits how quickly you can ramp up high-powered military assets like capital ships and starbases, but later on this becomes kind of irrelevant. At first they’re hard to come by, and you have to either unearth random ones from planets and asteroids you colonize or destroy enemy capital ships and salvage them – and because most major ships and starbases require a specific material, you may have to improvise with what’s available rather than go with your favorite ships out of the gate, which adds some variety from game to game. Eventually, though, you can research the ability to build refineries that slowly produce exotics out of the standard resources of metal and crystal you’ve extracted, and then you can build whatever you like – it’ll even auto-research the technologies and then produce the materials if you have the resources available, so all exotics really do after that point is add to build times. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In the midgame, Sins 2 really starts showing off what makes it different from the original.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When you reach the midgame, Sins 2 really starts showing off what makes it different from the original by layering on so many different systems that I had to play multiple, hours-long games before I came close to engaging with them all. Even having gone through an in-depth series of tutorials (there’s no traditional RTS story campaign in which to learn the ropes) and after over more than 40 hours of practice, it’s an overwhelming amount of things to keep track of: two parallel research trees with multiple paths, numerous planetary upgrades, buildable items you can equip on your individual capital ships and worlds, simple diplomacy with both player-controlled factions and independent worlds, culture expansion, resource management, pirate raids, other faction-specific mechanics like trade routes and castable powers, and unique Titan superships, among others. With the default settings, planets will even slowly orbit the sun in the center of the map at different rates, which sounds interesting but can be annoying if you forget to check the movement preview for a while and suddenly one of your worlds has drifted to the middle of enemy territory and is cut off from reinforcements. (It is, however, very funny when this happens to someone else.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For that matter, everything in Sins 2 appears to be moving slowly when you’re watching a fleet glide across a planet’s gravity well before jumping to the next or a progress bar for research or construction fill up, but it’s deceptive in that there’s virtually always something you can be doing to improve your empire. Once you figure out which menus to peruse to manage equipment on individual planets, capital ships, and starbases, view and expand available build slots on your planets, search for which of the dozens of technologies to research next, keep tabs on your economy growth, and more, it can feel like things are moving too quickly to do all of that and build fleets to send on lengthy journeys to where they’re needed to defend or attack. It’s workable because the tools for organizing fleets are simple and mostly intuitive, with improvements such as letting you build reinforcements directly from a fleet’s menu instead of seeking out a shipyard, but I’m still glad that I’m allowed to pause time (in single-player) to figure things out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a good thing that you don’t really have to micromanage your ships in combat if you don’t want to. You’ll certainly get more out of your battleships if you’re zooming in to manually do things like send out swarms of nanites to do damage over time, restore allies’ shields, or launch a massive missile salvo at a particularly bothersome enemy ship, but they’ll also auto-cast those abilities for you by default (as long as you’ve taken the time to choose which ones to unlock when a ship levels up). Similarly, precise positioning certainly matters because you can do things like keep your vulnerable ships outside the firing range of a starbase or stationary defensive turrets, and it’s always wise to try to save your experienced capital ships to fight another day by withdrawing from a fight before they’re destroyed (you’ll get frequent notifications when their shields are down or their hull is crippled, so it’s hard to miss those opportunities). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wars are won on a logistical level by making sure your fleet is well supplied and fully upgraded.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But those maneuvers matter most when you’re fighting an equally matched opponent, and the key to victory is to never do that if you don’t have to: wars are won on a logistical level by making sure your fleet is well supplied and fully upgraded, and has a good composition of light frigates and heavy cruisers along with speedy fighters, corvettes, and long-range support craft all backing up your capital ships. All the micromanagement in the world can only take you so far when you’re outnumbered two to one because your enemy had more shipyards and a more powerful economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, part of the reason I’ve been able to win most of my games without making full use of every tool at my disposal is because the rival empires’ AI tends to drop the ball in the late game. I’ve played multiple matches where enemy fleets would gang up on me by attacking on two fronts simultaneously and push me back to my core worlds, but then they’d back off while I still held enough territory to be able to rebuild my fleet. Eventually I was able to regroup and then steamroll them, even though they beat me to building the massive Titan warships at the very top of each faction’s tech tree. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s entirely possible that in these cases my opponents were too busy fighting each other to deal with me while I rebuilt my fleets, but the fact that neither took the time to deliver a killing blow to my home world and seize my territory when they had the chance seemed a little silly. Until that point, though, the AI puts up a good fight, with lots of opportunities for skirmishes and trading blows around border worlds.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works best as a multiplayer game because humans would have no such trouble going for the jugular. However, in practice I’ve never been able to actually finish a multiplayer game because of how long and involved they are. Even a “small” game of Sins 2 with two players on one of the pre-built or randomly generated maps is sprawling, involving dozens of planets and other heavenly bodies to fight over, which can take hours against an opponent who knows better than to leave his homeworld undefended; a large one can actually have multiple solar systems you can jump between and up to 10 players, so it’s quite a commitment for a group to see one through. To its credit, Sins 2 does allow for players to easily jump in and out, with AI taking over control of a faction until a human returns to pick up the reins again so you won’t be left unfulfilled if your opponents have other obligations to attend to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this is before you get to the modding scene, which is busily churning out conversions that let you add Star Destroyers, Battlestars, and Romulan Warbirds (among many others) to the mix using the built-in mod manager. If the original Sins of a Solar Empire is anything to go by, that community will keep giving us new fan-pleasing toys to play with for a very long time – maybe even decades – to come.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is a grand-scale real-time strategy game that asks that you keep up with its many complex systems for marathon sessions, but in return it gives you control over some of the most spectacular space battles in gaming. Ordering huge battleships, small fighters, and everything in between to launch all-out assaults on an enemy’s home world is a rewarding payoff for hours of navigating menus and keeping your eye on what feels like dozens of balls at once. Fully mastering the mechanics of its six factions will take many hours of tutorials, browsing guides, and watching explainer videos, but don’t let that intimidate you away from playing. Once you’ve learned the basics of making enough cash to buy a few spaceships, you can jump in and have a stellar time successfully conquering solar systems long before fully wrapping your head around all the nuances you’d need to compete in a multiplayer war. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-theyre-already-selling-out-again-2000630364</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-they%E2%80%99re-already-selling-out-again.1313047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one each for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble, and without paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>

            <p>
The thing about an adaptation, is that sometimes you've got to twist things slightly to better do what you want to do. Whether that's the right choice or not depends on how militant you are about the concept of faithfulness. When it comes to The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher</a> series, however, I expect most people won't care, except for the author of the original books Andrzej Sapkowski himself. His personal gripe? The very existence of different witcher schools.
</p>
<p>
In The Witcher games, there's various Witcher schools that crop up here and there, with Geralt of Rivia coming from the School of the Wolf. Except according to a recent AMA with Sapkowski on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-author-andrzej-sapkowski-says-one-of-cd-projekts-big-story-points-is-actually-based-on-a-mistake-but-videogame-people-have-clung-to-the-idea-with-remarkable-tenacity/">PC Gamer</a>), the whole idea of schools was completely blown out of proportion. "The issue of 'witcher schools' requires - I apologise - a longer explanation," Sapkowski wrote. "A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot."
</p>
<p>
For some context, The Last Wish is the first book he wrote in the series. The author goes on to explain that he didn't include any references to any other schools in any of his other books from that point on. "However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools.' Completely unnecessary."
</p>
<p>
Sapkowski also noted how he's not sure how he wants to go about dispelling this idea of schools, suggesting removing any mention of them in future editions of The Last Wish, or even just outright expanding and clarifying the idea in future books. "Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit."
</p><p>
I have to admit, this does tickle me quite a bit. I'm not a mega Witcher fan, I enjoyed the third one enough, but the schools did feel important enough to be relatively memorable. And they're just not really a thing apparently!
</p>
<p>
Ultimately Sapkowski's comments don't really matter as the games have obviously taken on a very large life of their own. I doubt there'll be anyone at CD Projekt Red who's going to lose any sleep over this either.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there was meant to be one last Witcher 3 patch this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-final-patch-delivering-cross-platform-mod-support-has-been-delayed-until-2026">but that recently got the boot to 2026</a>. I'm sure you can wait a while longer for your cross-platform mod support.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s Prime Day sales event starts next week on October 7. But the online retailer has already marked down a ton of products ahead of its made-up holiday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox?tag=kotaku01-20">including a long list of 4K UHD Blu-ray movies</a>. As streaming becomes more expensive and content is split up across more platforms and hidden behind more paywalls, owning a movie on Blu-ray is the best way to ensure you can watch it anytime you want at no extra cost. And, assuming you have the proper cables and setup, with 4K UHD Blu-rays, you get a picture quality that is better than compressed streaming content, too!</p> <p>Remember, you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these movies. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable.</p> <p>With that all out of the way, here are the UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon. Heads up that in the past, popular movies have sometimes sold out during these big UHD sales, so if something catches your eye, don’t wait too long to snag it. And if you’re looking for spooky movies ahead of Halloween, I’ve included plenty on the list below.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>A Quiet Place</em> -$15 ($35)</li> <li>A Quiet Place Part II – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Air Force One</em> – $15 ($27)</li> <li><em>Batman Begins</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight</em> – $14 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> – $13 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Returns</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Forever</em> – $13 ($25)</li> <li><em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Clueless</em> – $14 ($26)</li> <li><em>Cloverfield</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Dredd</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> – $15 ($34)</li> <li><em>E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</em> – $14 ($30)</li> <li><em>Evil Dead Rise</em> – $14 ($17)</li> <li><em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Friday the 13th</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Get Out</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Gladiator II</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Inglorious Basterds</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Mother!</em> – $11 ($24)</li> <li><em>Poltergeist</em> – $13.72 ($34)</li> <li><em>Reservoir Dogs</em> – $11 ($13)</li> <li><em>Saturday Night Fever</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Split</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture: Director’s Cut</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home –</em> $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek First Contact</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Insurrection</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Nemesis</em>— $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> – $15 ($23)</li> <li><em>The Thing</em> – $12 ($30)</li> <li><em>Titanic</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>TMNT: Mutant Mayhem</em> – $15 ($38)</li> <li><em>Top Gun</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Transformers One</em> – $15 ($36)</li> <li><em>Transformers Bumblebee</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>The Untouchables</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Us</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Van Helsing</em> – $10 ($23)</li> <li><em>Wayne’s World</em> – $11 ($26)</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony have teamed up with Reebok to create three special sneakers to celebrate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-limited-edition-30th-anniversary-ps5-consoles-look-fantastic/">thirty years of PlayStation.</a> There are three designs and all are quite tasteful, personally I’d love a pair of the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II kicks, but there is zero chance of that happening.</p>
<p>That’s because each of the three designs is exclusive to single store, in a single country.</p>


<p><br>
First up is the Reebok Workout Plus.</p>
<p>“Get fit, be fit with the stylish PlayStation | Reebok Workout Plus trainers. With two lace options, removable lacelock cable attachment, internal arch band for enhanced fit, and anniversary grey sockliners, the Workout Plus trainers are made for play.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the UK from <a href="https://www.endclothing.com/gb">End Clothing</a> from 15th October.</p>


<p>Next up is the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II.</p>
<p>“The Pump Omni Zone II are the ultimate throwback trainers. Featuring a custom pump ball styled in PlayStation colours, two lace options with metal tips, and tonnes of rad retro details, these kicks will have you balling in style, on the court or with a PlayStation controller.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the USA from <a href="https://cncpts.com/pages/new-york" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-3767a0f2-6251d66c">CNCPTS</a>&nbsp;starting 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;October.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, we have the Reebok Instapump Fury 94.</p>
<p>“Step back to where it all began. The original PlayStation launched in Japan in 1994, and these throwback trainers pay homage to the classic console with a pump ball with “Press Play” feature, a memory card design on the tongue, and fun, hidden details in the retro design.”</p>
<p>These can only be purchased in Japan from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beams.co.jp/en/shop/j/" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-40e706b6-e9584e22">Beams</a>&nbsp;starting 24th&nbsp;October.</p>
<p>No doubt these will be expensive to purchase and if you really, really, <em>really</em> like PlayStation and Reebok <em>and</em> have more cash than Jeff Bezos then you might want to grab one of 750 limited editions box sets that contain all three designs.</p>

			<p>Hades 2 v1.0 is here, and even though it's been in early access for over a year, there are plenty who waited for its full launch before jumping into Supergiant's latest.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Myself included, as I said in my review</a> of Hades 2, I avoided the sequel so I could have the same experience I had with the first game. Now that I've spent a good deal of time with the game and have felled Chronos and reached Olympus' peak, there are a few nuggets of wisdom I feel ready to share.</p>



<p>Starting with what is undoubtedly the only thing that the action fans of the first Hades game are curious about when it comes to jumping into Hades 2. How good are the weapons and which one is the best?</p>



<p>This tier guide will go through which are the best weapons in Hades 2, and where their pros and cons lie, even if they're not always what you want to grab on your way down into the Underworld, or up towards Mount Olympus.</p>



<h2 id="h-hades-2-weapons-tier-guide">Hades 2 Weapons Tier Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-the-sister-blades-lim-and-oros">S-Tier: The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros, in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting with the best of the best, there is really only one weapon sitting at the top of Mount Olympus compared to the other five Nocturnal arms available to Melinoë, and it's the Sister Blades, Lim and Oros.</p>



<p>They're the fastest weapons in Hades 2, with each of their starting aspects all extremely viable for wherever you are in the game. They don't need certain boons to be powerful; you can build around them easily, no matter what you're trying to lean into.</p>



<p>The Special lets you hit multiple enemies with different curses quickly, and while the two aspects you can unlock are more than viable, Melinoë's own aspect is already so powerful that you don't need to focus your resources and efforts on upgrading anything else.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-the-witch-s-staff-the-black-coat-and-the-moonstone-axe">A-Tier: The Witch's Staff, The Black Coat, and The Moonstone Axe</h3>



<p>Half of all the Nocturnal Arms sit in the A-tier, because they're all better than the rest but none are as good as the Sister Blades. </p>



<p><strong>The Witch's Staff, Descura</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Witch's Staff in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting off with The Witch's Staff, Descura, which is also the first weapon you'll have available to you right at the beginning of Hades 2. The Staff is similar to your starting sword in the first Hades. It's an all-around solid choice, even with a reliance on its charged attacks that really make the Staff shine. You'll definitely want to be levelling up your mana bar throughout your run with this weapon equipped, or have Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, but that doesn't hold the staff back from being a strong choice.</p>



<p><strong>Moonstone Axe, Zorephet</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Moonstone Axe in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zorephet, the Moonstone Axe's major drawback is that it's unfortunately slower than you might like for a typical run in Hades 2. That said, the aspect of Thanatos changes that, bringing it up to speed so you'll be able to do the immense amount of damage the axe already does even faster.</p>



<p>Even without the aspect of Thanatos, the Moonstone Axe more than makes up for its slow attack speed with the massive amounts of damage a single hit can deal. It's Special attack is also great at taking out multiple enemies and dealing Curse damage to every enemy in any given encounter since it easily reaches across most of the tighter spaces in Hades 2. </p>



<p>Yes, you might need to get used to how slow it can be, and you might not find your groove with it until you've unlocked the aspect of Thanatos, but even before that, it is a solid choice to build around and one of the better weapons to use in the game overall.</p>



<p><strong>The Black Coat, Xinth</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Black Coat in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the biggest drawback to The Black Coat, Xinth, is that it's the last weapon you'll unlock out of the six. That doesn't stop it from reaching above the other weapons you'll have had more time with by the time you get to it.</p>



<p>It's a jet pack that launches missiles and punches through enemies like nothing else. What more could you ask for, really? How it changes your sprint might take a bit to get used to, but it's Special attack lets you hit multiple enemies at once, its main attack is quick and akin to the speed of the Sister Blades, and one of its aspects even unlocks a powerful hidden Hex that is otherwise unavailable to you.</p>



<p>Like every other weapon mentioned so far, it's fairly easy to build around and doesn't require any particular boons or upgrades to be effective.</p>



<h3 id="h-b-tier-umbral-flames-ygnium">B-Tier: Umbral Flames, Ygnium</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Umbral Flames in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Umbral Flames can take some getting used to, and like the Witch's Staff, it's reliant on you having a large mana bar or Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, so you're not running around without the use of your charged attacks. That said, there's more to these flames than meets the eye when you first grab them in hand.</p>



<p>Its range lets you do consistent damage while staying out of the line of fire, and its Special orbiting around you helps keep enemies at bay when you don't have your Cast available to you. It's Eos aspect also adds a slow-moving grenade ready to do massive damage on top of the damage you're already dolling out with its base attack. </p>



<h3 id="h-c-tier-argent-skull">C-Tier: Argent Skull</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Argent Skull in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This will probably be the most controversial placement for this whole list, because yes, the Argent Skull, Revaal, can be massively powerful - if you have the right upgrades. That's why I have it all the way down in C-tier.</p>



<p>Out of all six weapons, the Argent Skull is the most 'great with the right upgrades' weapon in the game. At least for me, in a roguelike, that's not the marker of a good weapon choice. Without those upgrades, it packs a strong punch but makes you grab your ammo after firing.</p>



<p>I'm not saying this weapon isn't viable - all six can lead you to a win at the peak of Mount Olympus or in the depths of the Underworld, including the Argent Skull. But out of all of them, it's the one that comes with the biggest asterisk, because not only does it only get more useful with the right upgrades, it actively puts you in harm's way with how you'll need to move across each encounter to keep the skull loaded and ready to fire.</p>



<hr>



<p>Ultimately, these rankings are based on my own experiences with each weapon, and what you prefer might be different. Just make sure to give each a try to find what you like and what fits your playstyle.</p>

            <p>
It's been a while since we've had a new game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director Cory Davis. As far as I can tell, the last game he made was 2016's Here They Lie, a survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game. He's currently working on another horror game in fact, Sleep Awake, which is a horrendous name, though I think it's doing some interesting things. Weirdly, he's making the game alongside Nine Inch Nails guitarist (for live shows, anyway) Robin Finck, and while the game doesn't have a release date, it did just receive a demo.
</p>
<p>
Lemme tell ya, if there's one thing you can take away from Sleep Awake it's that PS3 games are back! Let me define what I mean here so I don't just sound like I'm trying to press some buzz words for the fun of it. I think a key thing about the PS3 era of games is that there was so much more scope for much more intimately designed, linear spaces, with much more room for detail compared to the PS2, but not quite enough resources to design something completely lifelike.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLWuPUJfE2I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
In a lot of ways, these intricately designed games often just had facades up, they looked bigger and more impressive than they actually were. The upside is that it also often made for interesting art direction, and a better established sense of space. So many big budget games now do look life-like, but the tradeoff is that all of this detail gets lost through the sheer quantity of it.
</p><p>
Sleep Awake's demo was only short, and very much felt like one long corridor, but it was an interesting to look at corridor. Your classic case of random bits of graffiti and wall carvings to denote story, interacting with random objects that does nothing but let you look at them close-up, data logs with bits of flavour text to build up the lore, it's all there.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of lore, or story I suppose, this game is set in a world where there's some kind of weird illness thingy that whisks people away if they fall asleep, so the protagonist is doing what they can to stay awake at all times, which occasionally leads to some hallucinations.
</p>
<p>
To be perfectly honest, the narrative didn't feel all that compelling. As mentioned, the demo was short, and did quite a bad job of bringing me into this world, it felt too jarring and disconnected. There also just wasn't really anything to actually do apart from walk around, look at some bits, and one very short section at the end where I had to hide from an enemy. I'd be remiss to not mention the fact that the writing was stilted and awkward, and the main character's performance matched that feeling a little too well unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
Still, the atmosphere and visuals pulled me in all the same. There's parts that are intercut with live action footage which, to its credit, actually unnerved me. A real arthouse, '70s vibe about it I feel I could really get down with. It is certainly going for a unique look, and I felt charmed by its 2009 throwback vibes, even if I'm uncertain of whether it'll be any good or not.
</p><p>
Still, it's a curious thing to have a game from someone that designed one of the most discussed games of the 2010s, and someone that plays guitar for Nine Inch Nails sometimes. Worth a punt! You can try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Capcom Cup started in 2013 with <i>Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition</i> as the Japanese publisher sought to professionalize and take more direct ownership of its hit fighting franchise’s competitive scene. It expanded into multi-month tours leading up to the big finals, with all of the biggest matches streamed for free online. And it’s continued that way, until now. Capcom announced this week that the 2026 finals for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> will be a pay-per-view event, and fans are not happy. “No one should be deprived of the opportunity to enjoy the pinnacle of <em>Street Fighter</em>,” Evo 2025 winner Saul Leonardo “MenaRD” Mena II <a href="https://x.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376">wrote on X</a> in response to the news.</p> <p>The two-time Capcom Cup champion hails from the Dominican Republic and noted, as many pros have, that locking esports behind a paywall particularly impacts fans from regions where the financial barriers are already higher. “I find it hard to accept,” he wrote. “I understand that in Japan, this is considered normal, and fortunately, the community is still able to support each other in this way. However, in many regions, including my own, there is hardly even the leeway to play this game.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">納得しがたいです</p> <p>日本ではこれが普通だと理解していますし、ありがたいことにコミュニティはまだこの方法で支え合えています。</p> <p>しかし、私の地域を含む多くの地域では、このゲームをプレイする余裕すらほとんどない。ストリートファイターの頂点を楽しむ機会を阻まれるべきではない。… <a href="https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu">https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu</a></p> <p>— WBG MenaRD🇩🇴 (@_MenaRD__) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/capcomcup/cc12/en/">Capcom Cup 12 Finals</a> will take place on March 14, followed by the <em>Street Fighter</em> League World Championship on March 15. Both will take place live at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in Tokyo, Japan, where front row seats will cost roughly $135. In a major break with the past, however, even virtual viewership will be ticketed this time around. The pay-per-view ticket price will be roughly $40 for both days. Anyone who doesn’t want to pay will have to wait until a week later to stream the matches online for free.</p>

 <p>The move caught many competitive<em> Street Fighter</em> pros by surprise. Next year’s Capcom Cup sports a $1,282,000 prize pool, unchanged from the prior year, despite the new income stream. “If this decision is final, then I hope at the very least a % of the PPV earnings be used to support the prize pool to improve the payout distribution for the players,” Arman “Phenom” Hanjani <a href="https://x.com/PhenomSF/status/1972393910438883538">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The issue is that while Capcom funds the CC Finals, they absolutely do not pay to run all of the tournaments where people qualify for Capcom Cup. Individual TOs and communities in countries around the world operate those events. Capcom benefits from the hardwork of those TOs and…</p> <p>— 女 Molly_Bee (@MollyAmberBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyAmberBee/status/1972796918666260953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also unclear how the PPV requirement will impact the rest of the competitive scene’s content creators who traditionally co-stream events. Others have wondered why Capcom doesn’t just try to extract more money through Capcom Cup-specific in-game outfits and other cosmetics. “I don’t know why they’re not doing this anymore. I used to buy the CPT costume pack every year, everyone wins and everyone is happy,” <a href="https://x.com/Bigbird_fgc/status/1972303220908417059">wrote</a> Adel&nbsp;“Big Bird” Anouche.</p>

 <p>Fans are equally bewildered, pointing to all of the local events that feed into the Capcom Pro Tour but aren’t directly financed by the publisher. “I thought Capcom organized this circuit as a marketing tool for the game,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nss7ou/capcom_announces_that_capcom_cup_12_finals_stream/">wrote</a> on Reddit. “Makes no sense to charge viewers to watch it. And esports is, unfortunately, still way too niche for that to be profitable.”</p> <p>While <em>Street Fighter</em> is massive in Japan, many are worried the move to PPV for such a big event will just end up excluding people in other parts of the world. Does Capcom care? Apparently not.</p>

            <p>
With Call of Duty: Blacks Ops 7's 14th November release date looming and its early access beta just days away, Activision has aired a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX3kSg2np68">big old Call of Duty Next showcase</a>, featuring - amid the enthusiastic shouting and endless "official partner" promotion - a heap of multiplayer news and gameplay, including a look at Warzone's new Resurgence map, and more.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty Black Op 7's open beta, as you probably already know, runs 5th-8th October, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-starts-2nd-october">early access beginning Thursday, 2nd October</a>. Things kick off at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT and those taking part will have access to six 6v6 maps. There's Blackheart (an off-shore oilrig), The Forge (a Tokyo R&amp;D facility), Toshin's downtown Tokyo, Exposure (the Australian outback), Imprint (an Alaskan weapons manufacturing facility), and Cortex's human testing site. Zombies fans, meanwhile, can try out the Vandorn Farm survival map, with beta pre-loading starting tomorrow, 1st October.

<p>
Still on maps, Activision also used its showcase to whizz through a few of Black Ops 7's 18 launch maps (16 for 6v6 matches, two for the series' new 20v20 Skirmish mode). Colossus, for instance, is a Black Ops 2 "callback", while Den takes players to a Japanese castle full of 2035 tech. There's Express, set in a Tokyo train station; Hijacked, whose action unfolds on a Tokyo Bay yacht; Homestead, set in and around David Mason's Alaskan childhood home, plus Paranoia - a more fantastical map inspired by the nightmare of David Mason's mind. You can see those and more in the flythrough trailer above, but if your mappetite still isn't sated, Activision says a further seven multiplayer maps will arrive as part of Black Ops 7's post-launch Season 1 plans, alongside two Survival maps and one round-based map for Zombies mode. Nuketown 2025, for instance, is due "shortly after launch".
</p><p>
Weapon-wise, Black Ops 7 features 16 new multiplayer weapons at launch, including the M10 Breacher - a pump-action shotgun that can be charged to reduce spread and land mid-range shots with more accuracy. Additional weapons (both new and returning favourites) are promised - alongside the likes of attachment rewards and weekly challenges - once Black Ops 7's post-launch seasons get underway. We also got a peak at some of the new Weapon Prestige attachments and camos coming in Black Ops 7, with Activision promising a "big" year for camo fans. Alongside a dedicated camo track in the co-op campaign, there are 16 mastery camos (split across multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and co-op), plus plenty more coming as season rewards.

<p>
Rounding out the multiplayer portion of Activision's showcase, there was a brief bit of Black Ops 7's "very competitive" new Overload mode. This, if you're unfamiliar, is a 6v6 objective mode in which each team attempts to secure the overload device and get it to one of the oppositions two zones. Success earns the victors one point and eight points equates to a win.
</p>
<p>
Next up, Zombies mode and its round-based Ashes of the Damned map. Inspired by the legend of the Bermuda Triangle, it's constructed from landmarks - all with a violent history - dragged into the Dark Ether. There's a ruined version Janus Towers Plaza, for instance; Black Water Cabin, where a famed horror director drowned his leading lady; Vandorn Farm, home to a murderous family and their unfortunate victims, plus the fractured Southern Georgia town of Ashwood. Between them lie endless waves of respawning undead, including the loot-snatching Ravagers. That's where your trusty wonder vehicle Tessie comes in though, providing an essential means of transporation that can be augmented with thrusters, chomp attacks, and more.
</p>
<p>
There's a closer look at Ashes of the Damned above, and if you like the sound of Vandorn Farm, it's playable as a Survival map in the imminent beta. More survival locations taken from round-based maps are promised post-launch.

<p>
Zombies mode also got a nod as Black Ops 7's showcase turned its attention to Warzone. That's thanks to Warzone's new Resurgence map, Haven's Hollow - a small Appalachian town that might look familiar to Zombies fans. It's essentially a pre-outbreak version of Liberty Falls, featuring nine unique points of interest across its autumnal expanse. There's the train station, mansion, lumber mill, riverboat, pond, coal depot, homestead, and Main Street, all of which appear in the flythrough above. And if that's got you ready to go, Haven's Hollow arrives with Season 1 later this year.
</p><p>
You'll need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX3kSg2np68">delve into the full several-hours-long showcase</a> if you want to properly scrutinise Activision's extensive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 gameplay. As a reminder, open beta early access begins this Thursday, 2nd October, and the full game launches on 14th November.
