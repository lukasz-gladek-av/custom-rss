            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elin-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese indie dev noa has announced an Early Access release date for&nbsp;<em>Elin</em>, the followup to legendary free roguelike JRPG&nbsp;<em>Elona</em>.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noacat/elin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">funded via Kickstarter last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elin&nbsp;</em>will enter Early Access on November 1st, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2135150/view/4365761760521795586" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's official Steam page</a>. The devs say you can expect the game to cost you around $20.</p>
<p>According to noa, there's still "a long way to go" before&nbsp;<em>Elin&nbsp;</em>could be called complete, but "over 150 updates" have been made since the game's alpha version launched towards the end of 2023. If you're interested, you can see the full&nbsp;<em>Elin&nbsp;</em>changelog, which contains details regarding all of the game's updates, <a href="https://ylvapedia.wiki/index.php?title=Elin:Changelog&amp;setlang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elin-early-access-release-date-town.jpg?itok=9mCn5QOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elin-early-access-release-date-town.jpg?itok=QNxgtXEI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elin&nbsp;</em>is hitting Early Access in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Changes made to the build this month include the addition of "unique divine equipment from all gods", as noa tells it, as well as new enchantments for both factions and equipment, new pet growth features, and "shipment reporting functions".</p>
<p>Beta keys for&nbsp;<em>Elin&nbsp;</em>will also be sent to all backers who haven't received a key yet in August, so if you're still waiting on your chance to try the game out, you shouldn't have to wait too much longer.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Elin&nbsp;</em>is, it's a roguelike JRPG with an emphasis on the twin concepts of "freedom" and "chaos", according to noa. It features a new isometric visual style, as well as an amount of content that "far exceeds" that offered by&nbsp;<em>Elona</em>, which, as noa points out, many people played "for thousands of hours".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elin-early-access-release-date-indoors.jpg?itok=9YLxeM1g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elin-early-access-release-date-indoors.jpg?itok=1n9txiiw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elin&nbsp;</em>is set to bring more of the same&nbsp;<em>Elona</em>-style fun you may already know and love.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elin</em>'s Steam page promises a "sandbox RPG with survival, crafting, home and town building and management", as well as a mixture of procedural generation and "well-developed fixed maps" that the devs say will be "faithful to the world setting". In short, if you loved&nbsp;<em>Elona</em>, you'll almost certainly love&nbsp;<em>Elin&nbsp;</em>too.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elin&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2135150/Elin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on November 1st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

I don't think I'm capable of rivalling Nic's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-meets-yakuza-in-paradise-killer-devs-and-ikumi-nakamuras-new-open-world-crime-game">enthusiasm</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-meets-yakuza-in-paradise-killer-devs-and-ikumi-nakamuras-new-open-world-crime-game">Promise Mascot Agency</a>, the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-killer">Paradise Killer</a> devs Kaizen Game Works, so I'll settle for saying "EEEEE". The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

<p>
My overall takeaway is that this seems quite a complex and in-earnest play experience, for all its obvious whimsy. The gist: you're a disgraced yakuza sent to a wonky backwater to run a mascot business - mascots, here, being monstrous cartoon organisms, rather than people in suits. You'll recruit mascots after negotiating terms such as time off allowance and profit share, assign them to businesses after further haggling, and then send human "heroes" to deal with any emergencies that arise, such as misbehaving cookers. The overall goal is to pay off a colossal debt, but if that's the only thing at stake I'll guzzle my fedora. In the words of game director Oli Clarke Smith: "this video shows you just the tip of the iceberg. There are many more mascots to meet, people to help and FORBIDDEN MYSTERIES to uncover."
</p>
<p>
Watching the footage, I can already feel myself settling into the rhythms of polishing my bottom line based on mascot traits, and building a rapport with eccentric clients. But this isn't just a management sim: you get to drive around town in a pick-up truck with Pinkie, your digital co-manager, who doubles (given upgrades) as a projectile for the purposes of smashing open secret areas. I really like the visual direction, from the sheeny, mildly grotesque character portraits to the mildewed geography: it's sparkling yet sour, like a dodgy gameshow watched at 3am on a cracked motel screen. It makes me think strongly of Persona 4's nowhereville. Will there be a school? It's surely missing a trick, if there isn't a school.
</p>
<p>
I'm supposed to be writing a<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-checklist-conquered-the-open-world-from-morrowind-to-skyrim"> feature series about open world games</a>, though the industry keeps interfering with my Creative Process by announcing stuff at me. Promise Mascot Agency feels like a strong act to follow. Part of the charm is its apparent smallness, next to yer Ubiworlds, and by extension, its concentrated sense of character. It's more of a neighbourhood than a world and that suits me just fine. It's out next year.

        <p>And there's new eco-friendly packaging too.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft's ever-expanding line-up of special edition Xbox wireless controllers has increased yet again, this time with the new transparent blue Sky Cipher - which (as well as looking like something straight out of the 90s, when tech wasn't worth a jot if it wasn't at least partially see-through) also heralds the introduction of new eco-friendly controller packaging.
</p>
<p>
Of course, a new Xbox controller reveal wouldn't be the same without at least <em>some</em> attempt to sex up what's very much just more of the same in a different colour, and the Sky Cipher Special Edition - with its metallic innards visible through blue plastic - is described as "exuding an aura of sophistication and futuristic appeal."
</p>
<p>
It also sports sky blue metallic triggers, a matching D-pad circled by a ring of dark blue, a set of "two-tone" thumbsticks - sky blue at the base, dark blue near the top - and sky blue rubberised grips on the rear. Battery life should last around 40 hours, it's got the usual 3.5mm audio jack, and works with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, iOS, Android, and Cloud Gaming devices.

<p>
Microsoft's Sky Cipher Special Edition is also the first Xbox controller to ship with the company's updated controller packaging, which is being introduced as part of its "commitment to reducing product carbon footprint." Single-use plastics have been removed, the paper manual has been replaced with a QR code linking to a digital quick start guide, and the whole thing is now 22 percent smaller and 21 percent lighter as a result. Just think how much weight and space Microsoft could save if it made the controller digital too!
</p>
<p>
If you've always dreamed of being able to stare at the innards of your Xbox controller while it vibrates alluringly in your hand, the Sky Cipher Special Edition will be <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/sky-cipher-special-edition">available from 13th August</a> and costs £64.99/$69.99 USD.

			<p>SAG-AFTRA has participated in many strikes, from striking for the rights of those working in Hollywood to those working in the TV industry. This time is no different, and SAG-AFTRA is now striking for those in the games industry. Since 25 July 2024, SAG-AFTRA has been on strike, where all projects with actors in them that have been in development for less than a year will no longer have access to the actors. This will continue until an agreement has been reached regarding the use of AI.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA's union members are on strike again after more than a year and a half of negotiations. While they don't deny that progress has been made, several video game companies continue to fight off the union. Specifically, the use of Artificial Intelligence in their video games and having actors protected against AI being shaped after them or even replaced entirely by Artificial Intelligence. While most major video game companies aren't considering even utilizing AI like this, some companies out there are beginning to test the waters using AI in any capacity.</p>
<p>While they are actively striking now, it's unlikely that the video game industry will see the effects of the ongoing strike for a while, as it wasn't evident for a while with the Hollywood strike. However, people can expect to see more delays going forward if video game companies aren't willing to meet SAG-AFTRA's demands.</p>
<p>The Hollywood strike that SAG-AFTRA coordinated took place for a whopping 118 days, and it's looking like the video game industry is desperately trying to avoid that happening again. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson responded to questions during a presentation where they reported their results for the <a href="https://ir.ea.com/home/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscal year's first quarter</a>.</p>
<p>In response to the questions, Andrew Wilson assured people that the SAG-AFTRA strike would not have any impact on their operations in the short term. He also mentioned that he is in negotiations with them.</p>
<p>"We are committed to continuing to negotiate in good faith and hope that the parties can quickly resolve our issues at the negotiating table. But we do not anticipate any significant short-term impact on EA." In addition to this statement, Wilson added, "This is not an EA-specific situation; it's an industry-specific situation, and we are working diligently to negotiate at the table."</p>
<p>Some of EA's pre-existing contracts are exempt from the SAG-AFTRA strike, such as Take Two's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-strike-wont-impact-gta-6-or-any-other-game-that-started-development-before-september-2023/">Grand Theft Auto VI contract</a>. This is because the game was in development before December 2023, meaning the game's development can continue on without facing punishment.</p>

<p>In an official <a href="https://discord.com/blog/see-whats-happening-on-discord-directly-from-your-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, Discord revealed multiple new features for its Xbox integration, one of which allows users to “watch your friends’ streams on Discord, directly from your Xbox.”</p>



<p>The blog post explains that when friends stream their game or app, users can watch on either Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S. That includes players streaming from “PC, mobile, or another Xbox.” </p>



<p>Xbox fans can simply open up the conversation’s member list, select the profile that’s streaming, and choose “Watch Stream.” This process will bring up a full-screen stream.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxInsiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxInsiders</a>! Starting this week, it’s now easier than ever to watch, chat, and play with your friends on Xbox and Discord. Check out the blog post linked below to learn more: <a href="https://t.co/rV6nuOlPIV">https://t.co/rV6nuOlPIV</a></p>— Xbox Insider (@xboxinsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/xboxinsider/status/1818663324080365811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The new update will also improve the Xbox Friends list to make it easier to connect. Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/31/xbox-insiders-its-easier-than-ever-to-watch-chat-and-play-with-your-friends-on-xbox-and-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that Xbox Insiders in the “Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha rings” can try out the features starting today. </p>



<p>However, the anticipated update with Discord streams on Xbox will “roll out over the coming weeks” as well as global availability. Discord did not confirm a concrete release date, nor details for specific regions.</p>



<p>Today’s blog post also breaks down the new Xbox Friends list. It will include active Discord friends and Discord voice channels under “Happening Now.” So, Xbox users will conveniently get to call Discord friends directly from their console.</p>



<p>Xbox’s blog post today reiterated that if Xbox and Discord account are linked, users can opt-in to include Discord friends by re-linking.</p>



<p>The announcement comes just a month after a PlayStation 5 system update <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-playstation-5-system-update-adds-discord-voice-chat-other-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added Discord voice chat</a> and other features.</p>

Sony Interactive Entertainment has worked tirelessly with us to identify roles for as many of our people as possible, enabling us together to save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force.</p><p>Second, we are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects—an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe—to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development.</p><p>This will be a time of tremendous change for our studio.</p><p>Let’s unpack how we ended up in this position; it’s important to understand how we got here.</p><p>For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises. To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly.  It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development—<em>Destiny</em> and <em>Marathon</em>.</p><p>Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Lightfall</em>, and the need to give both <em>The Final Shape</em> and <em>Marathon</em> the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve. We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red.</p><p>After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome. Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.</p><p>As a result, today we must say goodbye to incredible talent, colleagues, and friends.</p><p>This will be a challenging time at Bungie, and we’ll need to help our team navigate these changes in the weeks and months ahead. This will be a hard week, and we know that our team will need time to process, to ask questions, and to absorb this news. Today, and over the next several weeks, we will host team meetings and town halls, team breakout sessions, and private, individual sessions to ensure we are keeping our communication open and transparent.</p><p>Bungie will continue to make great games. We still have over 850 team members building Destiny and Marathon, and we will continue to build amazing experiences that exceed our players’ expectations.</p><p>There will be a time to talk about our goals and projects, but today is not that day. Today, our focus is on supporting our people.</p><p>—Pete Parsons</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-update-new-boss-descendants<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nexon's looter-shooter&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has received a major update that adds two new Descendants for you to play as, as well as a new boss to take on and more.</p>
<p>The first new Descendant is Ultimate Valby, a variant of the existing Descendant Valby that has improved stats and slightly different moves. Bubble Bullet has been replaced by Spiral Tidal Wave, a straight-flying projectile that can be stacked and fired three times in a row, and Hydro Pressure Bomb causes Ultimate Valby to leap forward and damage enemies in an area where she lands.</p>
<p>Your second new Descendant is Luna, an entirely new character who you'll likely vibe with if you're a fan of characters like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>'s Lucio or <i>League of Legends</i>' Seraphine. She's a music-themed Descendant with a curious rhythm mechanic that causes her damage to increase as you hit skills in time to the music.</p>

<p>That new Ultimate Weapon is called Peace Maker, which can build up stacks to fire its ammo in a single shot. As you can imagine, it'll likely make for a powerful addition to any arsenal.</p>
<p>This update arrives alongside a major hotfix that includes tons of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and other tweaks. You can read the full changelog for this&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2614115?headlineId=1015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>is a free-to-play looter-shooter created by Korean studio Nexon. Released earlier this month, the game sees players taking control of the titular Descendants, powerful individuals who must repel an invasion by the alien Vulgus race.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/are-kontrol-freeks-worth-it/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>If you’re a console-based gamer or you frequently use a controller on a PC setup, you might have heard of ‘Kontrol Freeks’. Even if you’ve never held a controller in your life, there’s a good chance you know what they are – but you might have written them off as not at all applicable to you. In this breakdown, we’re taking a closer look at the popular product that promises to help controller players better their aim in shooters. To that end, we’re asking a key question: ‘Are Kontrol Freeks worth it?’</p>



<p>Read on to find out if Kontrol Freeks really help.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-kontrol-freeks">What Are Kontrol Freeks?</h2>



<p>Let’s assume for a moment that you’ve never heard of these small rubber devices that sit atop the thumbsticks on a controller. That’s all they are – they’re specially shaped and moulded rubber ‘sticks’ that offer a boost to the height of a thumbstick, along with other ‘benefits’ like better grip and a bold aesthetic. </p>



<p>Kontrol Freeks come in all shapes and sizes, with some offering a super-high peak while others opt for a moderate boost. There are concave Kontrol Freeks and convex Kontrol Freeks to meet the needs of a wide variety of gamers, and some are specially themed to pay tribute to a certain franchise, such as Call of Duty.</p>



<p>From subtle purple to bright red, and from inky black to pure white, the Kontrol Freek market is diverse when it comes to picking the colour that you most appreciate. It’s worth stressing that there are hundreds of alternatives on the market, but none have the profile that Kontrol Freek does. </p>



<h2 id="h-do-kontrol-freeks-work">Do Kontrol Freeks Work?</h2>



<p>To answer the question, ‘Are Kontrol Freeks worth it,’ we need to lean on one core concern, and that’s whether or not they <strong>actually work</strong>.</p>



<p>By design, Kontrol Freeks are supposed to give you more accurate control over your thumbsticks, which allows you to finesse your aim and control recoil a little better, especially when playing first-person shooters. They also help you stay ‘on the stick’, especially if your hands are feeling a little sweaty. </p>



<p>Over the years, Kontrol Freeks became so popular that some controller manufacturers started building their ‘effects’ into their units, with brands like Scuf and Battle Beaver offering players permanently heightened sticks, or interchangeable pads that could mimic the effects of Kontrol Freeks.</p>



<p>As a brand, ‘KontrolFreek’ has been around since 2008, which means it’s doing something right. They’re not the most affordable extenders or grips on the market, but they are the most prolific and well-reviewed devices you’ll find anywhere. </p>



<p>But do Kontrol Freeks work?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In my experience, <strong>they do</strong>. They’re not going to make you an esports pro overnight, but they can help you to get a little more precision in your aim, depending on how comfortable you are with your thumb (or thumbs) being boosted. In the esports world, some players have drastically high thumbsticks, but you can start with a small boost and work your way up from there. It’s also a popular option to have a higher ‘aiming’ thumbstick than the ‘movement’ thumbstick.</p>



<p>But what are the downsides to Kontrol Freeks?</p>



<p>As a result of their tight grip on a thumbstick, they can chew the rubber to pieces, which means that when you take the Kontrol Freeks off, you’ll be left with permanent marks on the controller. They’re also not super cheap, as I just mentioned. They can also alter your impressions of a controller, so when it comes to playing without them, you’ll be at a disadvantage.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-kontrol-freeks-cheating">Are Kontrol Freeks Cheating?</h2>



<p>Here’s a funny question, while we’re on the topic.</p>



<p>Many people are under the impression that using Kontrol Freeks is a form of cheating as you’re ‘augmenting’ your controller, but that’s not the case. They’re perfectly ‘legal’ in most competitive settings and tournament organisers won’t have any issues with them being used. In the worlds of Call of Duty, Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege, and other shooter games, Kontrol Freeks are a fairly common sight.</p>



<p>If you’ve been wondering if Kontrol Freeks are worth it for R6 or Fortnite but you’re afraid of being labelled a cheater, don’t worry – you’re <em>fine</em>.</p>



<p>So, are Kontrol Freeks worth it? I’d say that they are but don’t expect miracles – there’s no replacement for innate talent and plenty of practice.</p>

As part of this effort, in 2023, Microsoft announced that all Xbox consoles would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-will-now-default-to-energy-saving-option-as-microsoft-looks-to-reduce-carbon-footprint/1100-6510478/" data-ref-id="1100-6510478">default to the energy-saving state</a> to help reduce the company's overall carbon footprint.</p><p>In 2019, Microsoft created <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-to-be-first-carbon-neutral-game-console-with-/1100-6470034/" data-ref-id="1100-6470034">825,000 carbon-neutral Xbox consoles as part of a test program</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/printers-suck-so-bad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I own a home printer. I bought it because, like many things I didn’t know I’d have to spend all my time doing when I started a business, I often need to print documents and mail them places. Years of asking friends to print things for me or sneakily printing personal documents at work made me think owning my own printer would be a good choice that improved my quality of life. It's not.</p><p>Here’s a non-exhaustive, unranked list of what sucks about this thing:</p><ul><li><span>When plugged in, it has a lot of color-changing lights I can’t turn off, much like my computer headphones and other gamer peripherals that have come into my possession over the years. The color of these lights doesn’t indicate anything, and they just exist to keep me from being able to sleep in any room occupied by my printer.</span></li><li><span>It came with a terrible desktop app. I actually just opened this app after writing the above bullet point, wondering if I could turn the lights off, but the main thing the app seems to be for is telling me I can buy ink from HP.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>It’s a wireless printer, connected to my single home network, and sits maybe three feet from both my computer and my router, and yet the odds all three of these items will be able to find each other when required changes every time.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>It chews through ink, apparently on purpose. When I tried to print some stuff a few weeks ago, I was surprised to find that the black ink cartridge was empty, but I chalked this up to assuming the factory-provided cartridge sucked. I bought a new one for <em>fifty American dollars</em>, printed less than 100 pages, and this weekend found that it was out of ink again. Researching this led me to a ton of printer nerds in forums who’ve made “coverage charts” demonstrating that, yep, this is working as intended.</span></li><li><span>The app would like to remind me that I could buy more ink from HP.</span></li><li><span>The printer will indicate that it is “ready,” but this status has no relation to whether or not anything will happen after I hit “print.” This weekend, I attempted to print a single page 10 times. Half of those times, the printer told me it “wasn’t ready” after I asked it to print, despite being “ready” moments ago. The other half, it continued to tell me it was “ready” but just didn’t do anything.</span></li><li><span>When I realized I was out of black ink this weekend, I decided I could just print in color, by selecting the “color” option from the print screen. This did not work. This did not work so much that I eventually removed the empty black ink cartridge from the printer, which caused the printer to throw a lengthy fit and refuse to print.</span></li><li><span>The app would like to remind me that I could buy more ink from HP.</span></li></ul><p>In fairness to my printer, an inanimate object that doesn’t need my empathy, I am willing to concede that printing is hard. I remember how long it took me to learn to write by hand, which I guess is the human equivalent of printing. But once I learned how to write, I could reliably write things down whenever the need arose. My printer has no such consistency, despite the fact that we’ve had home printers since at least the 80s. I don’t remember printing being this shitty when I was young, but maybe my expectations were lower with nascent technology, or maybe I just had a child’s sense of how things should work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is what makes the printer’s life so hard that its only recourse is to make <em>my </em>life hard too, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/why-all-printers-suck-even-the-best-ones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wirecutter</a>,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>there is some amazingly complicated technology in your printer, including the printheads, the ink, and the mapping software. You take your printer for granted, but that box can cover a piece of paper in millions of dots of precisely located, color-matched ink in a few seconds. You’re probably buying the printer for the cost of parts and distribution, which means the manufacturer is effectively subsidizing the thing on the premise that they’ll recoup their research and development costs (and the rest of their overhead) from your ink purchases.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7534/printers-will-always-be-terrible?zd=1&amp;zi=jegbef3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outline </a>points out that printers “have to attempt to cooperate with <em>every computer ever made</em>, and <em>every computer that ever will be made</em>,” which, OK, is a pretty tall order when you think about it. Taking these sites at their word and not assuming Big Print has gotten to them somehow, I guess I should be awed that the printer even occasionally works?</p><p>But I am not awed; I am angry. The fact that this problem seems universal–it’s not just my printer, or my computer, or my home network, or me–suggests that the problem rests with printers themselves, or at least <em>every</em> company that makes one, or–you might want to sit down for this–capitalism. As The Outline writes,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Blame the glory of the free market. Manufacturers were incentivised to make [printers] shittier. It’s similar to how freemium mobile games tend to prioritize addictiveness over quality in order to generate more in-app purchases. Or how Facebook utilizes aggressive growth hacks over not incinerating democracy. It’s a prioritization of profit above all else.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You probably know all this, and as such do not own a printer. You probably do what I used to do, and use your job’s printer, or print at the office supply store, or the library, or from one of your idiot friends like me who owns a printer. But me, your idiot friend, cannot print things for you, because even though it is 2024 in America, a country that has put a man on the moon, I cannot print things at home by pressing "print" on the machine designed specifically for the purpose of printing. I can merely spend hours cursing the heavens, wondering where in the three feet of ether my print job has gone, while a shitty app tells me it can sell me more ink. </p><p>(I feel like I should end this blog with that clip from <em>Office Space</em>, but it makes me feel old, and I already feel old enough writing a whole blog railing at technology. Sorry if that's what you were expecting here.)</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its financial summary for the final quarter of 2024, and while hardware sales are dire, the company is enjoying its highest gaming-related monthly active user count ever.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/SlidesFY24Q4.pptx?version=d1825a39-c7b8-f75f-fe23-275f2be198cc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">slideshow</a> accompanying its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q4/press-release-webcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earnings report</a>, Microsoft says its gaming revenue grew 44% this quarter when compared to the same period last year, citing its monumental <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> as one of the key reasons for this growth (which is an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-revenue-grows-49-due-to-activision-acquisition-xbox-hardware-up-3-year">increasingly common refrain</a> when it comes to Microsoft financials).</p>
<p>Additionally, the company says its "content and services revenue" grew by 61%, growth which Microsoft also attributes to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. It should come as no surprise that this acquisition has been so pivotal for Microsoft; it is, after all, the single biggest corporate purchase in gaming history, easily beating out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division">Take-Two's Zynga acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft also says it's attracting 500 million monthly active users to its gaming services and devices, which is a record for the company, so it's clear there's still great interest in Xbox as a brand, which should hopefully cushion the blow when it comes to consoles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-financials-maus-activision-blizzard.jpg?itok=Usp9pS9X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-financials-maus-activision-blizzard.jpg?itok=iVbSchSX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition is paying dividends already.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these healthy-looking numbers, Microsoft also says that hardware revenue has declined by 42%. Hardware decline is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-revenue-drops-4-year-on-year-while-xbox-hardware-revenue-declined-30">another</a> familiar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-revenue-grows-1-year-on-year-content-services-are-up-5-xbox-hardware">story</a> for Microsoft, but 42% is a particularly precipitous drop, perhaps indicating that Microsoft won't be staying in the console game for too much longer.</p>
<p>Indeed, a quick glance at the <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY24Q4.docx?version=c21096e2-8fc6-6a11-6c23-f836c9ebad32" rel="noopener" target="_blank">transcript of the earnings conference call</a> that accompanies the financial report tells a similar story. In that call, Microsoft head Satya Nadella says the goal for Xbox is to offer "content for everywhere people play games", and while he clarifies that means "starting with the PC", he goes on to say he wants Xbox to "access all the traditional high scale platforms" on which people play games.</p>
<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood concurs; later in the call, she says Xbox's goal is to "take a broad set of content to users in more places", and that the aim is to build a "software annuity and subscription business" that emphasizes "enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP", further reinforcing the idea that Xbox consoles are not long for this world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-financials-maus-xbox-series-x.jpg?itok=x7Nw5BMj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-financials-maus-xbox-series-x.jpg?itok=zmStfF1b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox consoles may not be long for this world.</figcaption></figure><p>Although console sales aren't looking too hot, Microsoft's general finances are looking pretty healthy. The company's overall revenue is up 24% on a year-over-year basis, which makes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">recent closure of studios like Tango and Arkane</a> even more galling if you ask me.</p>
<p>As far as its future is concerned, Microsoft says it's expecting further revenue growth throughout the 2025 fiscal year, but that hardware will likely continue to decline.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-is-encouraged-by-gaming-progress-with-500m-maus-fallout-playtime-jumped-5x-on-game-pass-after-the-show/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Microsoft's Q4 2024 earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella talked quite a bit about gaming. He shared (quotes via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fool.com</a>) a new milestone for monthly active users (MAUs) for games owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p><em>We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices, and our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. </em><em>18 of them, such as Call of Duty, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on devices they already have, including as of last month, Amazon Fire TV.</em></p>
<p>Of course, a sizable portion of that userbase comes from Activision Blizzard's prized IPs, like Call of Duty, Diablo, World of Warcraft, Candy Crush, et cetera. However, another franchise that earned a nod from the Microsoft CEO is Fallout, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a massive boost after the release of the first season of the Amazon Prime Video show.</p>
<p><em>Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. </em><em>It was the second most watched title on the platform ever and hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter over quarter.</em></p>
<p>That's not to say everything is peachy. While the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition continues to pay dividends (Xbox content and services are up 61% year-over-year, but 58% of that increase is due to ABK), hardware sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue</a> to decline, with console hardware revenue down 42%.</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A portion of the earnings call, investors asked Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood about the outlook for gaming. Here's what they had to say:</p>
<p><em><strong>Satya</strong> <strong>Nadella:</strong> Our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox, and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. When I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had.</em></p>
<p><em>We feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high-scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC, and mobile. But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? We <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-dont-need-an-xbox-to-play-xbox-says-new-fire-tv-app-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded</a> XCloud to Amazon Fire TV. That's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. That ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building toward. That was the strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Amy</strong> <strong>Hood: </strong>The real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what looks more like to us, the software annuity and subscription business, with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long term. As Satya mentioned, things were with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements.</em></p>
<p>Game Pass just added several big games and is about to <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-august-2024-lineup-just-got-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> even bigger, although it also became more <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expensive</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/31/sky-cipher-xbox-wireless-controller-transparent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a> today, Xbox officially announced the Sky Cipher Special Edition controller, as which releases alongside a new packaging design.</p>



<p>The announcement partly confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-controller-leak-teases-new-special-edition-release-possibly-coming-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a previous leak</a> from earlier this month, which correctly estimated Xbox will introduce the Sky Cipher controller this August.</p>



<p>Xbox now reveals that Sky Cipher has a blue and transparent design, and today’s post acknowledges the nostalgia factor of the latter. The controller also has “metallic features and silver interior parts that shine through from inside.” </p>



<p>Fans can pre-order the controller today in some Xbox markets. Xbox revealed the controller’s estimated price tag is $69.99. According to the product page, the Sky Cipher controller will be available soon on August 13, 2024.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Transparent tech is making a major comeback! We’re introducing an exciting, brand-new controller to the Xbox lineup, the Xbox Wireless Controller – Sky Cipher Special Edition: <a href="https://t.co/3TxMwJDKQa">https://t.co/3TxMwJDKQa</a></p>— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1818648057220673740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The design also includes two-tone thumbsticks, as well as metallic triggers and a matching D-pad. </p>



<p>Xbox added that the Sky Cipher will include a brand-new packaging design aiming to reduce the product carbon footprint. </p>



<p>Today’s blog says Sky Cipher’s packaging removes single-use plastics and the paper manual. Instead, Xbox replaced the latter with a QR code. Xbox also revealed that the new packaging will be about 20 percent smaller and lighter apiece. </p>



<p>Most recently, Xbox made headlines after introducing an amusing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-releases-new-controller-with-deadpools-butt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool-themed controller</a>, and later a Wolverine counterpart. However, these controllers are only available via giveaways, so fans cannot purchase them outright.</p>

                <p>One of the strangest debates in video gaming has been around the use of yellow paint to signal interactive objects in an environment. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-characters-and-everything-we-know/1100-6515795/" data-ref-id="1100-6515795">Star Wars Outlaws</a> does have this accessibility feature, but developer Ubisoft Massive will also let you turn it off, in case the thought of seeing a dash of signposting paint in a galaxy far (far!) away runs counter to your sense of immersion.</p><p>Players can choose Explorer Mode in Star Wars Outlaws, an option that turns off the "guiding color on core navigational elements" in the world around you (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/star-wars-outlaws-will-finally-let-us-turn-off-that-annoying-yellow-paint-on-every-climbing-surface/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). Essentially, this mutes the visual language that guides players toward interactive parts of the environment and collectibles. While this does make Star Wars Outlaws less video-gamey, the mode can potentially make navigating levels more of a chore.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars Outlaws - 20 Minutes of Imperial Base Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>"My major struggle was that it could often be tough to understand exactly what you're able to do," Phil Hornshaw wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-preview-hey-kid-you-wanna-do-space-crimes/1100-6525386/" data-ref-id="1100-6525386">Star Wars Outlaws preview</a>. "You know how people make fun of developers for covering everything in yellow paint to show you what can be climbed, blasted, or collected? Star Wars Outlaws is a pretty good example of why they do that, because I often felt unsure of what I could interact with in a given area. I appreciated that the game left me to figure out what I needed to do instead of just slapping a waypoint on it, but everything in Star Wars is covered in lights and buttons, making it tough to tell what's a control panel for Nix to flip or a generator you can shoot, and what's just a cool-looking background texture. It sometimes left me floundering to figure out what to do next."</p><p>There has been a big debate over the last couple of years regarding yellow paint in video games. Some critics call it a distracting method of signposting that is clumsily implemented, while proponents for it say that it helps make video games more accessible to a wider audience. While games like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor did make use of this visual language, it also added more-subtle design elements to indicate which areas of the environment could be further explored through the gameplay options available to players.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws will drop from hyperspace on August 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and puts players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-expands-the-galaxy-by-letting-you-play-a-kind-of-normal-person/1100-6525387/" data-ref-id="1100-6525387">in the boots of the resourceful Kay Vess</a>. Unlike the games developed by Respawn at EA, Outlaws is focused on a character who doesn't have any Force sensitivity and has to use her wits, cunning, and guile to survive in a hostile galaxy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-bounty-hunter-review-jango-deserves-better<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> released during an era when <em>Star Wars </em>games were a dime a dozen. It was pretty easy to miss a game or two, so I never played <em>Bounty Hunter </em>until now. Nonetheless, I was happy to see it get a port on modern platforms so I could finally experience a game through the eyes of one of my favorite <em>Star Wars</em> characters: Jango Fett.</p>
<p>Well, I have no nostalgia for <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>. I suspect this port by Aspyr is hoping for players to relive their experience with the game. Looking at it with a critical lens, in 2024, it's hard for me to see what the hype was all about, and moreover, the port leaves a lot to be desired. It's not a game befitting Jango Fett, that's for sure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-cutscene.jpg?itok=tUN3zYYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-cutscene.jpg?itok=ZiEzeuZh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Temuera Morrison reprised his role as Jango Fett in the original release -- less than a year after his debut in <em>Episode II</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Port Quality of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em></h2>
<p>Originally launching in 2002, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is a bonafide antique. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-old-republic-kotor">early 2000s</a> had its fair share of classics, but it can be a bit rough experiencing older games in 2024. That is, unfortunately, the case here. It's a game rife with issues stemming from 2002 game design, and those issues persist today, despite the chance to be fixed in this port.</p>
<p>But before all the doom and gloom, in terms of visual fidelity, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> features a fresh coat of paint. It's not a remaster, but Aspyr likely did the same upscaling as they did in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response"><em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em></a><em> </em>launch earlier in the year. And hey, it looks pretty great here. Textures are crisp, and lighting is overall improved.</p>
<p>I got a chance to try out both the PS2 and GameCube versions of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> just for comparison's sake, and Aspyr breathes new life into a game that looks rather rough around the edges on its original consoles. Its visuals are by far the best thing this game has going for it.</p>

Namely the camera, which was notoriously jank back in the day (and I can confirm this having played the originals less than a week ago, as of this review). Aspyr claims to have updated the camera system in this port, which might be true, but it's definitely no better than it was before.</p>
<p>Many deaths or mishaps in my playthrough can be attributed to this reworked camera, which was still jerky and finicky. In short, it's atrocious, and the lock-on system often butts heads with the camera and creates situations where you can walk off cliffs or get pummeled by enemies. Get used to getting frustrated is all I can say.</p>

<p>It would have been great to see an improvement to <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>'s save system, but it is antiquated. There's a checkpoint system and five lives for each level, and if you die you spawn on these checkpoints. You can't save in the middle of a level, so if you quit, you have to restart the level.</p>
<p>That's just not practical in this day and age, but it's not too surprising in an older game. Other than that, AI is dumber than a box of rocks, and heck, I even had one of the final bosses stand still after a few seconds of fighting. They didn't shoot, they didn't do anything -- the boss simply let me kill them without a fuss.</p>
<p>There isn't any extra gameplay content in this port beyond achievements, as far as I can tell, so don't go expecting to find new surprises. The extras from the original game are still unlockable by collecting bounties and such, but I'm sure that's not a huge incentive for players returning to experience this game again.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is very much a game of its era. Playing as Jango Fett before the start of <em>Episode II</em>, you're on a cross-galaxy trip to capture bounties and put an end to a notorious, intergalactic cult. You'll shoot and jetpack across six different chapters, each featuring its own planets and environments.</p>
<p>It's a very straightforward game. Jango Fett has an arsenal of weapons like the flamethrower, rockets, poison darts, and of course, duel blasters. You'll rely on the latter the most. There's his jetpack, too, which isn't as capable as I'd like -- since it's usable only in short bursts -- but still fun to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting-2.jpg?itok=KHHw1mBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting-2.jpg?itok=rlGAvXV1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It feels a little messed up to wipe out an entire civilization full of Sebulba's bros.</figcaption></figure><p>This adventure is a third-person shooter/platformer hybrid, often tasking players to shoot through an absurd number of infinitely respawning enemies as they navigate to an objective. Levels take advantage of Jango's jetpack, but often times platforming sequences feel like a pain what with all the enemies around.</p>
<p>In the original <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>, Jango Fett's blasters shot as fast as you could pull the trigger. The base fire rate is improved here by just holding down the trigger, but you're still better off mashing it as fast as possible. Some enemies are spongy and soak up hits, so your finger is likely to feel tired after a few rounds of combat -- that was certainly the case for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-bounty.jpg?itok=zf8ZwEyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-bounty.jpg?itok=D_Lw6-Mf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This guy is definitely peddling death sticks.</figcaption></figure><p>In between combat, you can scan crowds and enemies for bounties to either capture or kill. You'll earn unlockables this way, though it's purely optional. Thankfully, Aspyr adds some improved controls which makes this game slightly less cumbersome to play on modern controllers.</p>
<p>A big improvement to all of these mechanics is that scanning for bounties slows time down, as opposed to the original. When you're fighting a dozen enemies shooting you at the same time, the slow motion is a great help.</p>
<p>Enemy overload is apparent in the last several levels and is quite a pain. Hordes of enemies run at you and the best solution is to torch them with a flamethrower. The finale should go all out but instead feels more like an afterthought compared to some of the earlier levels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-unlock.jpg?itok=7lgH7G3c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-unlock.jpg?itok=d2jNpU5_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Concept art is always cool, and here is no different.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If we ignore the lacking quality of this port, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> shows its age. It's really not all that fun playing as Jango Fett, with his limited jetpack fuel and the constant need to mash the trigger. With so many enemies that respawn constantly, there's little to get excited about. Its saving grace is a somewhat palatable story, and decently fun platforming.</p>
<p>Bundle everything together and you have a very shoddy experience. <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is intriguing to experience as a fan of the series and character, but does little else. The camera, by far the worst part of this whole experience, makes me hesitant to go back and play this antiquated title for quite a while.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter isn't a good game, nor is it necessarily bad, but its age shows as you play through its campaign. Not only that but the port quality and terrible camera controls leave a lot to be desired. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>I’m as guilty as many of you regarding using console commands and cheats in Bethesda’s open-world titles. I still occasionally spawn a few hundred thousand Caps in Fallout 4 so that I can buy and modify all of the custom weapons I mod into the game. But there’s a new kid on the block! So, without further ado, here’s a full list of Fallout: London console commands and cheats!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-one-of-the-fallout-london-console-commands-and-cheats">Every One of the Fallout: London Console Commands and Cheats</h2>



<p>You have access to a rather large number of Fallout: London console commands and cheat codes, which you can activate or deactivate at any time during gameplay!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>player.additem (Item ID) (Value)</strong> – Add a specific item to your inventory.</li>



<li><strong>additem (Item ID) (Value)</strong> – Add a specific item to your character.</li>



<li>p<strong>layer.addperk (Perk ID)</strong> – Grant your character a specific perk.</li>



<li><strong>(Ref ID) .amod (OMOD ID)</strong> – Attach a specific attachment to your current weapon.</li>



<li><strong>sexchange</strong> – Change your character’s gender.</li>



<li><strong>player.setav carryweight (Value)</strong> – Set your carry weight to a specific value.</li>



<li><strong>kah </strong>– Kill all enemy NPCs in the immediate area.</li>



<li><strong>killall </strong>– Kill all NPNs in the immediate area.</li>



<li><strong>showlooksmenu player</strong> – Open the character creation menu to alter your character’s appearance, name, background, and traits.</li>



<li><strong>(Ref ID) .rmod (OMOD ID) </strong>– Remove an attachment from your weapon.</li>



<li><strong>player.removeperk (Perk ID)</strong> – Remove a specific perk from your character.</li>



<li><strong>resurrect </strong>– Resurrect a selected NPC.</li>



<li><strong>player.setlevel (Value) </strong>– Set your character to a specific level.</li>

<li><strong>tcl </strong>– Turn on/off no clip to remove collision.</li>



<li><strong>unlock </strong>– Unlock targeted doors or containers.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-use-console-commands-in-fallout-london">How to Use Console Commands in Fallout: London</h2>



<p>As Fallout: London doesn’t entirely replace Fallout 4 during installation—it’s running over the top of the original product, like an overhaul mod—it utilizes the same console command system you’re like familiar with. To use console commands in Fallout: London, hit the tilde (~) on your keyboard to open the command menu. Once it appears in the bottom left corner of your screen, you may start typing or copy/paste cheats into the console.</p>



<p>Be wary of what cheats you use, though. It’s possible to irreversibly break your game, which may require a fresh install!</p>

<p>Check back shortly because we’ll have plenty more from the world of Fallout: London in the coming days! In the meantime, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>?</p>

                <p>Japanese director Suda51 said that he would like to revisit the killer7 series one day, either in the form of a "definitive edition," a sequel, or both.</p><p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/aAQE3GIjdu4?si=F9tGC0Nh4ef3R8ps&amp;t=2277" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">second Grasshopper Direct 2024</a>, Goichi "Suda51" Suda and Shinji Mikami gave a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadows-of-the-damned-is-getting-remaster-12-years-after-it-was-released/1100-6514997/" data-ref-id="1100-6514997">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a>. At the end of the video, they were both asked about what their future plans would be. Mikami said that he'd like to see Suda51 create a sequel to killer7, but Suda51 responded that he'd rather make a complete edition of the game first.</p><p>However, he didn't directly rule out a sequel, spit-balling possible names such as "killer11," killer7-something," and "killer7: Beyond." While Mikami was initially apprehensive of the killer7 complete-edition idea, he added that it would actually be doable and the fans probably would love it. Suda51 concluded that they would have to figure out whether the complete edition or sequel would come first.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1818636209867932122" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Shinji Mikami says he would love to see Suda51 make a killer7 sequel.

Every time I step out of an elevator, I accelerate wildly in case the elevator falls without warning and chops me in half, leaving the frontal and, all things considered, inferior portion of my body swaying in place for a second before collapsing in a cloud of bisected bone and organ. Don't laugh: I know you do this too. Kletka isn't helping: created by <a href="https://ln404.itch.io/">in404</a>, it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> scavenging game reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

The elevator's roof is a gnashing, lipless mouth with a lantern dangling beneath it like a droplet of drool. It parts and closes ever so gently as you scurry around with hunched shoulders, refuelling the generator and patching the machinery. You can almost feel its breath in your hair. Needless to say, you'll want to keep it sated with edible objects pilfered from the surrounding world. I spent my 15 minutes in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1699480/KLETKA/">Steam demo</a> with both eyes riveted to the screen displaying the creature's level of peckishness and my cursor hovering over the brake lever.
</p>
<p>
The rooms and corridors of the Gigastructure aren't much safer than the elevator. They're as dark as a dog's interior, and chocabloc with traps such as landmines and lakes of electrified water. The game's rusty, lichenous PS1-era visual direction makes spotting resources and items a fiddle, and your all-important torch has to switch off and recharge at regular intervals. Worst of all, you'll have to deal with Samosbor. I'm not sure what Samosbor is, but you can't kill it. If you see a lot of red light, run run run as you would from a Balrog with the mumps.
</p>
<p>
Kletka's demo includes a multiplayer mode for up to four - this won't allow crossplay with the full release, which is due later this year. You can spectate online games and join the proceedings when the host finds a vending machine in the Gigastructure, as when rescuing Survivors from closets in Left 4 Dead. Also as in Left 4 Dead, though for different reasons, co-op partners are worth having around even when they suck at the game. Teamwork makes the dream work, yes, but Kletka's Steam blurb offers the fine counterargument that "friends make for good fuel".
