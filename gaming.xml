			<p>I was ten years old when Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles first released. In the days of demo disks and consoles set up in shops, I was able to try the demo at the time and it was the closest a game had gotten to letting you feel like not only a Jedi, but a Jedi of your choice. Nowadays, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review/">Star Wars Jedi</a> series pretty much nailing the “be a Jedi” thing, you might think that a remaster of the side-scrolling Jedi Power Battles is fodder for nostalgia and nothing more. And you’d be right.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles  - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YboMt_0kAJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Graphically, Jedi Power Battles is a huge improvement with this remastered release. It’s sharp, textures are much higher quality, there’s even reflections in places! If all you’re after is to replay the game, but with it looking like how you remember it in your rose-tinted memories, then this is the game for you.</p>


<p>In fact, it goes further than graphical improvements, with all the playable characters and levels all unlocked from the very beginning. Did you always want to inexplicably be Darth Maul fighting off Federation droids? Well you can do that immediately upon loading the game here, rather than having to first complete the game as Qui Gon Jinn to unlock Maul. And there’s the Star Wars music in the background as well, along with some creative uses of Yoda noises when picking up power ups that still make me laugh. It’s clearly designed to invoke that nostalgia, provided you have some for this game.</p>


<p>But if you don’t have that nostalgia? Well, the issue here is that this was an original PlayStation game. Combat is stiff and doesn’t flow very well at all – I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve run up to an enemy and pressed attack only for it not attack and for the droid I was attacking to punch me in the face instead. Because moves don’t really flow together very well, attacking feels like just swinging a lightsaber repeatedly with a brief delay between them that allows the enemy you’re trying to kill to get a hit in because lightsabers only take about a quarter of their health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can deflect a blaster bolt back at an enemy with a well timed press of the block button – easily the most satisfying aspect of gameplay – and it’ll one-shot them, so blasters deal more damage than lightsabers do, it turns out.</p>
<p>The side-scrolling platforming fares a little better, you can at least judge your jumps well enough to pull them off with relative ease.</p>

<p>What could have made all this stiffness irrelevant is the Force. If you had great Force powers that are fun and make you feel powerful, you might settle for stiff combat. Each character you can play as (excluding those without lightsabers, such as Queen Amidala) has three force powers. One is long range, another short, and another is defensive. Unfortunately they’re incredibly inconsistent as well as inaccurate to the lore.</p>
<p>I started with Darth Maul, because he’s awesome despite the awful film he was in, and his long range power is to shoot a laser from his eyes for some reason. Even so, you’ll be lucky if it actually hits a single one of the crowd of enemies in front of you. Qui Gon Jinn has got a particular set of skills that should make him a nightmare for droids like these, except here his long range and defensive skills don’t seem to work at all for some reason. They just don’t trigger – I get lightsaber attacks or jumps instead and my force power doesn’t drop.</p>
<p>The end result is just inconsistent in the same way that many of Aspyr’s Star Wars remasters have been. It looks nice enough for a remastered PlayStation game, but I just can’t imagine anyone wanting to play it for longer than thirty minutes outside of an attempt to recapture the feeling they had when they were younger and playing it for the first time.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		What Jedi Power Battles really needed was a remake, not a remaster, so that the gameplay could be brought up to something worth playing in this decade. If you want to be a Jedi these days there are way, way better options out there.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-221-adds-dlss-4-on-pc-and-additional-fixes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has announced that patch 2.21 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077"><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u></a> is rolling out to players on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. The brunt of the changes are largely fixes for photo mode, as well as DLSS 4 support for PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-22-fully-revealed-and-its-out-now"><u>patch 2.2</u></a> added a much deeper look at customization in photo mode, 2.21 adds heaps of fixes for the mode. One of the most notable is the ability to finally save characters and V’s rotation and position within your Photo Mode presets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also fixes present for “texture and color inconsistencies for vehicles that have CrystalCoat applied,” in addition to several other menu fixes for the vehicle customization system added in patch 2.11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking at creating a character in future runs, you can now also preserve randomizer settings within the character creator after further customization of character attributes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a handful of changes to allow Johnny Silverhand to appear more in the passenger seat of your car if you’re ever feeling lonely while driving along the streets of Dogtown. Patch 2.2 originally sought to resolve this by having Johnny sitting shotgun around 25% of the time, which didn’t happen. The inverse also occurred, where Johnny could appear duplicated in the passenger seat in quests where he is set to appear during a scripted event. The new patch will solve any ghostly duplications of Silverhand, and have him spend more time with V in a car this time around.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most notably, the game has also added DLSS 4 support for PC players, as well as Multi Frame Generation for RTX 50-series GPUs. This tool will now allow players to boost their FPS by “up to three times per traditionally rendered frame,” so long as you have the new GPUs to run it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTX 40-series users can also enjoy “faster single frame generation with reduced memory usage." All Nvidia RTX GPU owners can also choose between the traditional CNN model in DLSS features to the new Transformer model, which CD Projekt claimed can enhance “stability, lighting, and detail in motion." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTX users can also enjoy enhanced Ray Reconstruction, with fewer artifacts and smudging in patch 2.21.

        <p>Surgent Studios is a studio that has been garnering attention for its original approach to storytelling, founded by renowned British actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim.

        <p>Introducing the everplay group.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a> Group has announced a new name and look for the company, which will now be known as everplay group.
</p>
<p>
But the Team17 name will live on, as the company's Team17 development and publishing arm will remain as Team17 Digital.
</p>
<p>
In effect, little will change the next time you load up a new Team17 game. What has changed is that the parent company, formerly Team17 Group, now has a different moniker to reflect the fact it has had - for some time - owned a couple of other brands.
</p>
<p>
The newly-renamed everplay group has three main prongs: Team17, simulation game developer and publisher Astragon Entertainment - bought in 2022, plus educational app maker StoryToys - acquired in 2021.
</p>
<p>
"[everplay] continues to focus on the wealth of opportunities in the indie, children's games and working simulation markets by launching exceptional new games," the company said in a statement today. 
</p>
<p>
"At the same time, everplay focuses on driving back catalogue sales by prioritising our portfolio and evergreen franchises, while adopting innovative publishing and marketing models to maximise discoverability and appeal in the marketplace."
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The newly-rebranded everplay group logo. | <span>Image credit: <cite>everplay</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Team17 and its parent company have changed significantly over the past decade, since the business was floated on the London Stock Exchange and the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-reported-at-worms-maker-team17">has focused increasingly on third-party publishing</a>. During that time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/significant-job-losses-likely-at-worms-publisher-team17-sources">numerous jobs were lost</a> within the company's development-focused arm, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-extent-of-team17-cuts-threaten-third-of-the-company-sources">up to a third of the company was at risk of redundancy in 2023</a>.
</p><p>
Founded in 1990, Team17's early years saw it become best known for developing games such as Worms and Alien Breed. The past decade has seen its publishing arm launch third-party indie hits such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>, Moving Out and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I am excited to be unveiling our new Group brand today, which we believe better represents our business which has evolved greatly since the IPO and reflects our DNA to never stop playing," said everplay group chief executive officer Steve Bell. 
</p>
<p>
"This rebrand not only creates an ideal backdrop to foster greater cross-collaboration internally but also reflects our aspirations to expand our reach across complementary sectors within the broader indie market."

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update started rolling out today, bringing improvements to the system software performance and more.</p>
<p>As confirmed earlier today, the system software update 25.01-10.60.00 started rolling out today in a phased release. According to the update notes, this is a minor system software update, as it brings the usual system software performance and stability improvements as well as improved messages and usability on some screens. Besides these changes, the new system software update doesn't seem to introduce anything else.</p>
<p>It has been some time since the release of the latest PlayStation 5 major system software update. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24.06 update</a> launched last September introduced the Welcome hub, personalized 3D audio profiles, Remote Play improvements, and more. Of these, the Welcome hub was definitely the most important new feature, as it introduced a space on the console's home screen that can be customized using different widgets that display, for example, the battery level for connected accessories, the console's current storage status, and more. The update also introduced some under-the-hood changes that impacted several games, like Final Fantasy XVI which required <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-10-01-00/">another update to fix.</a></p>
<p>Additional information on the latest PlayStation 5 system software update can be found on the console's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/it-it/support/hardware/ps5/system-software/">official website.</a></p>

            <p>Some eager beavers who bought the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review">GeForce RTX 4090</a> at launch were, quite infamously, rewarded for their investment with a defective power adapter, one that that could <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/some-of-nvidias-rtx-4090-power-adapters-are-err-melting">melt the plastic in their £1679 graphics card</a> like it was Ronald Lacey’s face. Nvidia reckon that won’t be an issue with for the imminent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">RTX 5090 and RTX 5080</a>, though, even with the former’s drastically increased 575W power limit.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by South Korean site <a href="https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qn_report/views/444251">Quasar Zone</a> (and machine-translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-confident-that-rtx-50-series-power-connectors-unlikely-to-melt-despite-higher-tdp">Tom’s Hardware</a>), Nvidia execs fielded an audience question at an AI-focused RTX in Seoul, asking whether the new GPUs had fixed the singeing issue. "I don't expect that to happen with the RTX 50 series," came the response (Quasar Zone doesn’t name the speaker). "We made some changes to the connectors to address the issue at the time, and I understand that the issue has not occurred in about two years."</p>
<p>Mystery Graphics Man is referring to a redesigned power adapter that replaced the original, melty one not long after its destructive tendencies became widely known. Sure enough, this led to reports of incinerated RTX 4090s largely drying up, and while many of the defective cables did remain in the wild – and have still been causing trouble in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQwlgx0vPbI">more recent times</a> – the fix obviously predates the RTX 50 series. Hence, Nvidia’s confidence that their top-spec cards won’t melt down again.</p>

<p>I’ve spent much of this week playing with an RTX 5090 for a very imminent review, and for what it’s worth... actually, does this violate the embargo? If I say something <em>didn’t</em> catch fire? Is that bad form? Nah screw it, mine hasn’t caught fire. But then, neither did my RTX 4090 review unit, so maybe I’m just lucky. Hopefully that luck will hold as Nvidia’s NDA enforcement team tactically breach my flat with flashbang grenades.</p><p>Less encouraging for the RTX 50 series’ launch, scheduled for January 30th, are a growing number of warnings over available stock levels. PowerGPU, a US-based seller of prebuilt gaming PCs, <a href="https://x.com/PowerGPU/status/1881758554836877675">Xeeted</a> that the RTX 5090 will be "the worst" on availability, with stock problems potentially lasting for at least three months. Here in the UK, meanwhile, Overclockers – one of the biggest gaming PC hardware retailers – <a href="https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/threads/patience-if-planning-to-buy-a-50-series.18998084/#post-37602115">warned on their forums</a> that they only have a few hundred RTX 5080s and "single digit" RTX 5090s, just one week before launch. A return to the misery of 2020’s RTX 30 series shortage and subsequent megainflation? No way. I’m not going back. I’M NOT GOING BACK THERE. No, not you, officers, I’m talking about the stock levels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developers of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 have confirmed that the game’s story was completed at the end of 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-story-has-been-completed">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Story Has Been Completed </h2>



<p>As spotted by Genki_JPN on <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1882281479713214682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-plot-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), Final Fantasy 7 Remake producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed Part 3’s plot during an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202501/30815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>. Kitase stated that Tetsuya Nomura, Final Fantasy 7 Remake director, handed over the story for part 3 at the end of last year, and he is “very satisfied with it” and is “sure it will be a satisfying conclusion for fans as well”.</p>



<p>Kitase elaborates that Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is the conclusion of the series, making it integral into the franchise. Hence, he gave Nomura the homework to deliver “something that would respect the original while also giving a sense of satisfaction beyond what could be experienced in the original.” He wants a story that can “conclude the Remake Project.” It seems we might receive this instalment much sooner than expected.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-ff7-rebirth-s-pc-upgrades-might-arrive-for-ps5-version">FF7 Rebirth’s PC Upgrades Might Arrive for PS5 Version</h2>



<p>The developers also discussed bringing FF7 Rebirth <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1882297316381770153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC’s upgrades to the PS5 version</a>. Naoki Hamaguchi revealed they received many requests for upgrades for the PC version to be brought to the PS5 version. The developers “would like to make it happen at some point,” but it has to be within the PS5 version’s performance limits.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After the reported flop of Resident Evil 7 on iPhone last year, we wondered whether Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a> would face a similar fate - and it seems this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>Data from mobile app tracking service Appmagic, shared by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/resident-evil-2-struggles-to-100k-as-triple-a-flops-continue/">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, estimates that the mobile port of Capcom's remake has only just managed to pass $100k in in-app purchase earnings.</p>

<p>Resident Evil 2 Remake's mobile port - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-2-remake-heading-to-iphone-and-mac-in-december">which was released in December</a> - allows users to play a short portion of the game for free, but to get the full experience they need to pay. During the first few weeks of its release, this was discounted to $10. According to estimates, Capcom made $95k during this discount period, meaning roughly 9500 users purchased the full game after getting to the paywall.</p>

<p>Since 9th January - when the game was then boosted up to its full retail price of $40 (£31.99 here in the UK) - Capcom has made an additional $7k from the mobile release, so that's roughly 175 more users opting to pay to play.</p>
<p>This isn't the only one of Capcom's mobile ports to underwhelm, but at least Resident Evil 2 Remake has done better than Resi 7's efforts. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">report from July of last year suggested Resident Evil 7 had been bought by under 2000 people</a> in its first couple of weeks on the store, with only a scant 2.4 percent of players converting from the free opening to paid version.</p><p>As for what is next for Capcom's franchise, last year Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">the studio was developing a new series entry</a>. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said at the time. "But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 patch is now live, introducing NVIDIA DLSS 4 support to the game which brings, with its Transformer model, significant image quality improvements over DLSS 3.8.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/538843836072329454?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2.21 patch</a>, which went live earlier today, introduces, among different things, new Photo Mode features, vehicle color customization fixes, randomizer settings in Character Creation, and a slew of other general fixes. The biggest addition, however, is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, including support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi Frame Generation</a> for the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. Following the patch, it is possible to choose between the old CNN model or the Transformer model for DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Ray Reconstruction on all RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>As highlighted by NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">earlier this month</a>, the new NVIDIA DLSS 4 Transformer model does bring significant image quality improvements, as highlighted in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a>. In Cyberpunk 2077, the new model comes with a small performance cost, but image quality benefits greatly from it, as ghosting is considerably reduced, and the image looks more detailed than before in motion. Anti-aliasing for distant objects is improved as well.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One worldwide.

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202501/30815">Famitsu</a> ahead of the PC release of Rebirth alongside game director Naoki Hamaguchi, series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the status of the next game, adding he's "very satisfied with it".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi stated development on the third game began right after Rebirth ended and is progressing without delay from the team's schedule, though it's still publicly unknown when the planned release date will be.</p>

<p>Kitase added Rebirth creative director Tetsuya Nomura was given "homework" to give the remake project a conclusion that both respected the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> and provided a new sense of satisfaction not felt in the original. This was completed by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>"I'm very satisfied with it, so I'm sure the fans will be satisfied with the final chapter," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the interview, the pair discussed the increased importance of the PC platform as player numbers increase.</p>
<p>Kitase noted how development costs are rising, so "we need to deliver [the game] to a wider market". This is in-line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's current multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>
<p>He even joked the PC version is convenient to play in window mode to look up strategies online.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi added there's been interest from fans to add PC features to the PS5 version, specifically the option to fast-forward cutscenes, which the development team would like to include within the limits of the PS5's capabilities. He also mentioned the possibility of adding a New Game Plus mode to the forthcoming third game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-option-to-speed-up-cutscenes-led-to-an-increase-in-players-says-director/">separate interview with Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi stated the option to speed up cutscenes in Final Fantasy 7 Remake led to an increased interest in the game.</p>
<p>"Nowadays, many people watch videos and movies at double speed. I myself have little time, so I often use the speed-up function," he said. "I think we are in an age where we should let the user decide what kind of experience they have. Rather than letting (long cutscenes) become an obstacle that prevents people playing the game, I think we should incorporate such (time-saving) functions more and more."</p>
<p>Lastly, Hamaguchi also clarified with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20250123-326211/">Automaton</a> the relationship between Cloud and Aerith. In a previous interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-game-awards-interview-aerith">Inverse</a>, Hamaguchi described their relationship as "sisterly".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has now gone back on this comment, claiming it was a "misunderstanding". Instead, he will communicate the relationships between characters solely through game content. "No one will officially say anything about who Cloud likes," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ea-cuts-financial-forecasts-as-ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperform/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has cut its financial forecasts for the current fiscal year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>, its biggest moneyspinner by far, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> both underperformed at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>While the company had been expecting a single-digit growth in “mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings” – these encapsulate everything from game sales to DLC and microtransactions – the end result is that there will instead be a “mid-single-digit decline”. The majority of this is to blame on a slowdown with EA Sports FC 25.</p>


<p>While FC 25 will be the most to blame for the dip in financials, the underperformance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be more worrying for the company’s future direction.</p>
<p>EA say that Dragon Age: The Veilguard “engaged” with around 1.5 million players during its release quarter, but this is down nearly 50 percent on the company’s expectations, and isn’t even an accurate description of total game sales. This is a real shame after the game was generally well received by critics, and a long-awaited return to what BioWare is best known for. Coming a decade on from Dragon Age: Inquisition, a game which won numerous Game of the Year awards in 2014, and which sold 12 million copies over its lifetime, The Veilguard is a big step back from that. That said, it could certainly reach a wider audience through the first half of 2025, if EA push it through subscription services and with targeted promotional discounts.</p>
<p>This naturally causes fresh concerns for the future of BioWare, and puts more pressure on their next game to succeed, with the studios focus having already shifted over to the next Mass Effect game.</p>

<p>We had a good time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with Jason saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">our review</a>, “The Veilguard is a beautiful-looking and highly enjoyable game, and a nice return to a more focused feeling RPG that does justice to both Dragon Age as a series and also to Bioware. It’s fun to play in the moment-to-moment, the big decisions feel impactful and worthwhile, and fans of the series will be happy to be running around chasing after that lamentable egg of an Elf once more.”</p>

<p>According to a new interview with Insomniac, Marvel’s Wolverine may or may not be released in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-have-to-be-like-logan-today-and-remain-very-stoic-insomniac-quiet-on-whether-wolverine-will-make-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-founder-and-president-ted-price-is-retiring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new co-heads</a> of Insomniac, Ryan Schneider, Chad Dezern and Jen Huang, were asked whether Marvel’s Wolverine is still slated to release in 2025. Dezern didn’t confirm or deny the release window but stated they would “love to talk more about Wolverine”, as the title has already been announced. Still, they must “be like Logan today and remain very stoic until it’s time to pop the claws down the road”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dezern added that they will have to hold on to their “pent-up excitement” for Marvel’s Wolverine, and that’s all they could speak about their upcoming projects during the conversation. Marvel’s Wolverine was announced during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021, where a small snippet showcased the character’s iconic claws. Since then, we have yet to hear any official announcements for the game; however, much has been revealed through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/major-wolverine-leaks-appear-online-spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, the Insomniac heads also expressed interest in “game-to-screen adaptations.” Ryan Schneider spoke about the Ratchet &amp; Clank film and how they “got an early start on that.” Schneider added that they are “interested in that kind of thing,” and the team loves Ratchet &amp; Clank in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel’s Wolverine’s creative director has joined <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xboxs-perfect-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s Perfect Dark team</a>. Also, Insomniac confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no additional story content is coming</a> for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.

<p>PockerPair Publishing and Tales of Kenzera: Zau developers Surgent Studios have announced that they’ll be joining forces, with PocketPair supporting the development of a new horror game at Surgent.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the publisher said, “We’re pleased to announce that our first project as Pocketpair Publishing will be supporting a brand new horror game from Surgent Studios. SURGENT STUDIOS is a studio with an original approach, and Pocketpair is excited to support them to the fullest extent.

<p>The game hit a peak concurrent player count of 2,101,867, making it one of Steam’s highest-ever concurrent player counts. As of February 22, 2024, the company announced that the game sold 15 million copies on Steam and had reached 10 million players on Xbox.</p>

Now I think about, you could probably eat quite a lot of custard creams in five months, although less so if you were using your hands to build model robots. Have a trailer. It's got robots in it.</p>

<p>A very nice, digital press release with zero custard cream crumbs on it tells me that Mashina is based around "positive verbs" like 'build', 'nurture', 'discover', 'mend', and 'bomb'. It uses traditional stop motion capture with digital techniques, and the music is a tribute to Gamecube-era soundtracks, with the same synth used in Metroid Prime. "Warm and crunchy digital baths" is the phrased used, which I enjoy immensely. Track below. Jack's games always have such fantastic music.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter is very close to its £12,000 goal already, but still has around 3 weeks to go. If you've got a spare £500, you can even get yourself your own robot. They are very nice robots but I reckon I could probably draw a face on a dustbin lid and spend the rest on chips and Ric Flair action figures and a utility bill or two and be roughly as content. Again though, very nice robots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developer of the GTA 6 parody game Grand Taking Ages is launching on Steam after a revamp. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, a title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-iv-grand-taking-ages-ps-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Taking Ages VI </a>popped up on the PlayStation Store, and it felt eerily similar to Rockstar’s highly anticipated 2025 release, GTA 6, with both games even having the same acronym (GTA VI). After a closer look, it was revealed that Grand Taking Ages VI was a game development simulator where the player manages a studio while tackling obstacles that developers encounter while creating the game. The title was recently pulled from the PlayStation Store due to its controversial appearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reveals that Grand Taking Ages, the GTA 6 parody game, is now launching on Steam while remaining pulled from the PlayStation Store. The developer, Violarte, stated that their approach towards Steam differed, as they “engaged with the team” early on with the game’s concept before the official submission. For its approval, the game underwent a “thorough” review process to be listed on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After arriving on Steam, you can spot key differences in the GTA 6 parody game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a>. Grand Taking Ages has dropped the number ‘VI’ from the title. Additionally, they have new screenshots, a fresh trailer, and a revamped description. These changes were made to “clearly differentiate Grand Taking Ages from the original inspiration, GTA 6, and to emphasize its unique direction.”</p>



<p>Grand Taking Ages developer also addressed the PlayStation Store listing, stating they “strongly believe” that the new changes should be enough for the game to return to the platform. The game is slated to release in July 2025; check out its new description:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Coming Soon Since Forever! Start your game dev journey in Mom’s garage! Battle angry fans, dodge ruthless journalists, and perfect the art of “creative” deadlines. Survive on pizza and energy drinks while building your dream studio into… a slightly better garage!</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/insomniac-founder-ted-price-announces-his-retirement-after-30-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Insomniac founder and president Ted Price has announced his retirement from the games industry, having led the company for the past 30 years. He will step down at the end of March 2025 and will be replaced by three studio co-heads.</p>
<p>Ted Price has been integral to Insomniac throughout its history, the creative director behind Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance: Fall of Man. All of them are PlayStation icons for their respective generations, with Ratchet &amp; Clank continuing to be a family friendly favourite to this day.</p>


<p><a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/">In his retirement blog post</a>, and after initially addressing the hardship facing many in the wake of the wildfires in California, Price said:</p>
<p>Another aspect of our culture I hold dear is the Insomniacs’ ability to pull together and successfully overcome what often seem like insurmountable obstacles.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, despite a challenging 2024, Insomniacs stayed fully focused on building games for our fans. As a result of the team’s persistence and collaboration, we’re in one of the strongest positions we’ve experienced in years, with each game in development looking beautiful and playing fantastic.</p>

<p>Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March. Today, I’m sharing this news more broadly.</p>
<p>I actually made this decision last year. For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.</p>
<p>Filling the space that Price is vacating will be three co-heads for the studio: Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider and Jen Huang.</p>
<p>Schneider joined Insomniac during the PS2 era on the marketing and comms side, and has most recently been Head of Brand and Leadership Strategy. Huang joined eight years ago as CFO and Head of Finance, having previously been a finance exec elsewhere. Lastly, Dezern started at Insomniac back in 1998 as part of the creative team working in various roles as&nbsp;Environment Artist, Art Director, Studio Director for the Durham studio, and as the Head of Creative since 2017.</p>
<p>Of the trio, Price writes:</p>
<p>For many years, Chad, Jen and Ryan have been instrumental in making Insomniac what we are today. I’ve seen each lead major initiatives here which have positively changed Insomniacs’ lives. Plus, they’ve consistently demonstrated the kind of collaboration and transparency that’s part of our DNA. And just as important, their skillsets are truly complementary.</p>
<p>There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.</p>

            <p>Wolverine is going to be Insomniac's next big game, but despite the project being announced several years ago, the studio is still keeping a release date under wraps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". It also still had its Marvel's Spider-Man sequel in the works at this point, with that project ultimately releasing in 2023.</p>
<p>But, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> now out in the wild, and Insomniac previously stating it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-developer-has-no-additional-story-content-planned-for-its-web-slinging-sequel">"no additional story content planned" for its web-slinging sequel</a>, many had hoped to hear more about Wolverine. However, the studio isn't quite ready to share too much about its upcoming project just yet, although it appreciates there is plenty of "pent up excitement" around it.</p>

</figure>
<p>Our latest morsel on the game comes gollowing Insomniac co-founder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-studio-boss-ted-price-announces-retirement-from-games-industry">Ted Price's retirement announcement yesterday</a>. The Wolverine studio now has three new co-heads - Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang - and the trio sat down to chat with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/">Variety</a> about what this means for Insomniac, and naturally the topic of Wolverine came up.</p>
<p>The studio execs would not confirm or deny a 2025 release window when questioned, but did Dezern did say this:</p>
<p>"We've announced Wolverine, and we'd love to talk more about Wolverine, but we have to be like Logan today, and remain very stoic until it's time to pop the claws down the road. As much as we're as much as we have pent up excitement, we got to hold on to it. So that's, that's about as much as we could say about our upcoming projects today."</p>

</figure>
<p>Other than that brief teaser from 2021, any official word on Wolverine has been slimmer than slim.</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files were stolen from Insomniac Games by ransomware hackers</a>. Following this attack, people began playing - and uploading footage - of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version">incomplete early development build of Wolverine</a>, which was found within the stolen files.</p>
<p>Then, in October of last year, it was revealed the game's creative director had moved across to Xbox, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-wolverine-creative-director-now-leading-xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot">joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot</a>, meaning Wolverine would now be led by Marcus Smith. Meanwhile, Mike Daly became Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain would remain with Insomniac, but in a different role.</p>
<p>At one point, there were rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-could-reportedly-launch-as-early-as-autumn-2024">Wolverine could release in 2024</a>, which clearly did not happen. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-reportedly-due-2025-darker-than-spider-man">there was word of a 2025 release</a>, which of course could still happen, so stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Legendary video game composer Grant Kirkhope has said he has "zero hope" of seeing a new Banjo-Kazooie game.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Kirkhope went on to <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882247865357209894">suggest</a> that any new attempt at reviving the dormant platforming franchise was doomed to failure, as "diehard fans would instantly hate it" regardless of "how good it was".
</p>
<p>
Kirkhope is famous for having scored a swathe of classic titles from the heyday of British development powerhouse Rare. He penned the scores of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and Perfect Dark, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>.

<p>
More recently, Kirkhope's fame has been revived with work on more modern platformers, including the distinctly Banjo-esque <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, as well as Ubisoft's Mario + Rabbids games.
</p>
<p>
"I hope that last tweet didn't come across as mean," Kirkhope <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882298146971410457">added</a>, several hours later. "The Banjo fanverse is a wonderful thing, the reaction when Banjo got into Smash Bros. is something I'll remember for the rest of my life ❤️"
</p>
<p>
Fans of the classic Banjo-Kazooie games have long called for a new installment from developer Rare, but to date there's been no suggestion that one is in the works. 
</p>
<p>
Rare itself is busy maintaining hit pirate live-service <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, and has the long-in-development fantasy game Everwild next on its docket.
</p>
<p>
Still, Banjo-Kazooie's popularity endures. Classic games in the franchise have been re-released over the years, including via Xbox's Rare game compilation Rare Replay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-tooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">as well as on Nintendo Switch Online</a>. And, as Kirkhope mentioned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-joins-super-smash-bros-ultimate-line-up">Microsoft gave the nod for the characters to turn up in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. Could there still be hope for Banjo and Kazooie yet?

            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind Afrofuturist metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> publisher Pocketpair to release its next game.</p>
<p>Set for release in 2025, it will be a horror game but not part of the Tales of Kenzera universe.</p>
<p>Last year's Tales of Kenzera: Zau, published by EA, was the first in the series, with more games planned to continue that world. However, this next game will be a shorter and separate project.</p>

<p>"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. It will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say," said Surgent Studios CEO Abubakar Salim.</p>
<p>"We're still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going."</p>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing.</p>
<p>"As the games industry continues to grow, more and more games find themselves struggling to get funded or greenlit," said head of Pocketpair Publishing John Buckley. "We think this is a real shame, because there are so many incredible creators and ideas out there that just need a little help to become incredible games.</p><p>"We were instantly fascinated by Abubakar's creative vision for a horror game on a topic he's uniquely qualified to explore. The ultimate goal of Pocketpair Publishing is to find creators with a genuine passion for games and enable them to create fun, new experiences for gamers all over the world."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer was shown a prototype for a new gothic horror game called Project Uso</a>, where players take the role of a vampiric android bearing the soul of Eshu, the god of chaos.</p>
<p>However, Surgent Studios has confirmed to Eurogamer today's announcement is a separate project, while Project Uso will be the continuation of the Tales of Kenzera world.</p>
<p>As a result, details on this new small project are largely unknown. It's set to release later this year.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This is the energy I want to see driving games in 2025—developers lifting each other up, creating together, and pushing the industry forward.</p><p>Massive love to the Pocketpair team! It’s an incredible honor to be the first partnership announced with <a href="https://twitter.com/PocketpairPBLSH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PocketpairPBLSH</a> We’ve been… <a href="https://t.co/DM8Z7Lp4oK">https://t.co/DM8Z7Lp4oK</a></p></div>— Abubakar Salim (@Abzybabzy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Abzybabzy/status/1882353922582450360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Following Tales of Kenzera: Zau, staff from Surgent Studios faced redundancy as the developer sought funding for its next project.</p>
<p>"There is this idea of constantly being pushed to grow, to be bigger, to do more, to spend more," Salim previously told Eurogamer. "And within an industry that is, rightfully, so artistic in its nature, that isn't necessarily always the answer."</p>
<p>That consideration may point to the decision to work with Pocketpair on this new, smaller game.</p>
<p>Salim has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abubakar-salim-addresses-fever-pitch-of-racism-received-after-launch-of-tales-of-kenzera-zau">received a torrent of racist abuse online</a>, in the midst of openness about the development of Tales of Kenzera.</p>
<p>"I'm happy that we've been really open with as much as we can," he said. "Whatever feedback you have, send it through. Racism isn't feedback."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in December, a bunch of cool games had the extreme impoliteness to sneak onto digital shelves while we were losing our hair, souls and marbles covering various gaming award shows. One of those games was Escape From Castle Matsumoto - which can be excused, admittedly, because it's a game about ninjas, and we expect ninjas to be sneaky.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It's a free splitscreen pixelart heist oddity in which two ninjas race to be the first to loot a daimyo's castle. While scouring the mansion in your half of the screen, you can lay traps and obstacles for the rival shinobi. If push comes to shove comes to roundhouse kick, you can also fight them directly.</p>
<p>It's kind of nifty. It looks like it's from the 80s. Here's a video.</p>

<p>I had a play just now and can (re)confirm that I suck at being a ninja. In my defence, I Narutoed straight into <a href="https://mausimus.itch.io/efcm">the Itch.io browser edition</a> without even glancing at the control scheme. Impetuosity is not one of the ninja virtues, I gather. There's probably an ancient ninja proverb about always reading the manual. Still, it was calming to watch my bot opponent gracefully case the joint while I loitered menacingly in a hallway, trying to find the smoke bomb button.</p><p>You may fare better. Perhaps you'd like to up the stakes and challenge a friend, even - there's online, LAN and same-computer multiplayer, according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490030/Escape_From_Castle_Matsumoto/">Steam page</a>. The developers are <a href="https://mausimus.net/">mausimus</a> and Chris "Joker" Femo. Good for them, I say. We can always do with more ninja games.</p>
<p><strong>Stealthy update</strong>: RPS commenters inform me that the correct precedent here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy_(1984_video_game)">Spy vs Spy</a>, originally written for the C64. The similarities are pretty obvious from screenshots, but in my defence, Spy vs Spy is one of the sadly decreasing number of video games that came out before I was born.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349938/royal-shakespeare-company-macbeth-game-lili<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Macbeth</em>, William Shakespeare’s iconic play, is being reimagined as an interactive video game with a neo-noir vibe — and it’s being developed in part by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The game, titled <em>Lili</em>, is a “screen life thriller video game” where you’ll have access to a modern-day Lady Macbeth’s personal devices, according to a press release.</p><p>“Players will be immersed in a stylized, neo-noir vision of modern Iran, where surveillance and authoritarianism are part of daily life,” the release says. “The gameplay will feature a blend of live-action cinema within an interactive game format, giving players the chance to immerse themselves in the world of Lady Macbeth and make choices that influence her destiny.” It sounds kind of like a version of <em>Macbeth</em> inspired by Sam Barlow’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20828666/telling-lies-review-steam-iphone-sam-barlow-interactive-thriller-her-story">interactive</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031558/immortality-is-coming-to-ps5">thrillers</a>.</p><p>The Royal Shakespeare Company is making the game in collaboration with iNK Stories, a New York-based indie studio and publisher that also made <em>1979 Revolution: Black Friday</em>. It stars Zar Amir as “Lady Macbeth (Lili),” per the press release.</p><p><em>Lili</em> is set to release “later in 2025.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
