            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Nintendo and Lego have become regular collaborators in recent years. Between its Lego Mario line of toys and more recent models like an NES or Bowser, the Nintendo-specific Lego sets are plentiful enough that they take up huge sections of the aisle in toy stores. Today, the two announced their latest collaboration: a replica of Nintendo's first handheld, the Game Boy.</p><p>The set is aimed towards nostalgic adults, coming with an 18+ age recommendation. It doesn't light up, and it's (perhaps obviously) not a playable system, but the buttons are designed to be pressed, with a realistic tactile feel. The model comes with two game cartridges – Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening – which can be inserted just as you would into the real handheld. It also comes with swappable screens to simulate each game, along with a third option showing the Nintendo logo.</p><p>Take a look for yourself at the photo gallery below.</p><p>The Lego set will retail for $59.99 in the United States. It launches October 1 of this year, but you can preorder one at regular Lego retailers (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=ignlego-20&amp;ascsubtag=070hgOr7WJvqG6SJWg1FAAQ">Amazon</a>) starting today.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/a-lego-game-boy-replica-comes-out-this-october]]></content:encoded>

<p>Accompanying the short tribute video of the voice actor's many roles in the Pokémon anime — where Carter played Professor Oak, Gary Oak, Meowth, and Team Rocket's James — along with the below message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of James Carter Cathcart, the voice behind Professor Oak, Gary Oak, James and Meowth of Team Rocket, and other iconic characters for the Pokémon animated series over many years</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>In addition to his voice work, James provided over 700 episodes of scripts for the animated series, shaping the stories that defined generations of fans. From the very first episode to the final journeys, James brought warmth, humor, and unforgettable charm to the world of Pokémon. His talent gave life to some of our most beloved characters, and his legacy will continue to reach the hearts of Trainers everywhere.</p>
<p>James’s voice will always be part of our adventure. Our thoughts and condolences are with his family and friends."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carter recorded voice lines for over 700 episodes of the anime, but retired from voice acting in 2023 after being diagnosed with throat cancer.</p>
<p>The video ends on a rather poignant moment from the anime where Meowth and a Glameow are riding a boat while looking at the moon.</p></section>

      <div><p>As Critical Role's San Diego Comic-Con panel continued, they debuted footage from the upcoming Season 4 of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> alongside a release window, and the confirmation that the fifth season has been greenlit, but that it will also be the last.</p>

<p>In addition to this announcement, a short clip was played from the upcoming season highlighting Vox Machina's plan to rob the Cobalt Soul with the help of Taryon Darrington. This is the first time we've seen Taryon and his construct companion, Doty, in motion for <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Executive Producers and Critical Role Co-Founders Sam Riegel and Travis Willingham had the following to say on the announcement of the final season of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's so rare for any television series to get to tell a complete story, beginning to end, exactly as it was envisioned, we're so grateful to our fans, the critters, our partners at Prime Video, and the original Kickstarter backers for bringing this show to life, and turning the numbskulls of Vox Machina into animation legends."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What's next after <em>The Legend Of Vox Machina</em>?</h2>

<p>This wasn't the only piece of Critical Role animation news at the San Diego Comic-Con panel as a teaser animation and release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> was also announced.</p>

<p>Additionally, even though there is no specific announcement, fans of Critical Role are waiting with bated breath for any potential announcements of animated adaptations of their third campaign, Bells Hells, and any of the spin-off series like Calamity or Downfall.</p>

On July 22, every member of its roster said they were either going independent or taking a break from streaming for a while. Some of the VTubers said they hadn’t been paid in months. It remains unclear how much money VShojo owes them and whether that money&nbsp;will ever be paid. </p><p>While the agency is now shutting down, and the $515,000 it was supposed to pay to the Immune Deficiency Foundation may never materialize, a fresh fundraiser Ironmouse recently announced has already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948360664956784828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948360664956784828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised over $1 million more for the organization</a></span>.

Games with choice-based dialogue trees, branching paths, open worlds, and hundreds of NPCs, and enormous lists of side content would simply require far too many pages across multiple books.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us series for PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png"></figure><p>The Last of Us, on the other hand, sets up particularly well for this format. No other game has been described as cinematic or referred to as an "interactive movie" as frequently as The Last of Us. Heck, many of the scenes in HBO's adaptation are pulled straight from the game, no interpretation required.</p><hr><p>The Last of Us doesn't have choice-based dialogue, branching paths, or a sprawling open world to explore. The gameplay experience in the first game is essentially scripted. The sequel is more dynamic, granting players more freedom to approach combat encounters and puzzles in different ways. But much like Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4, the "open" set pieces are still fundamentally linear.</p><p>This doesn't mean that the scripts will read just like a screenplay or teleplay. There are still lots of interactive components to the worlds of each game that will naturally be found amidst conversations between Joel and Ellie. All of the text that fills the space between lines of dialogue should be illuminating. Chances are fans will glean new insights from the text.</p><p>Screenplays, which are typically 90-120 pages, aren't published nearly as often as they once were, but occasionally we see teleplay collections for popular TV shows. HBO's The Last of Us adaptation isn't one of them--at least not yet--but HBO has recent experience publishing scriptbooks for its shows.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, Ironmouse, a Vtuber who <a href="https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-twitch-subscriber-record-kai-cenat-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefly held the record for most Twitch subscriptions of all time</a>, shocked the streaming world by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLbGcUMy6g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing her exit from VShojo</a>, a major North American Vtuber agency that rose to prominence alongside her. The reason? She felt she’d been “misled” and that she was “owed a significant amount of funds,” including a whopping $500,000 meant for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, for which she’d raised money during the 2024 marathon that broke Twitch’s subscriber record. Now, one mass exodus later, she’s raised more than double that amount.</p><p>Like other agencies, VShojo is meant to provide Vtubers with resources to aid in marketing, opportunities, creation of virtual avatars, and things of the like. VShojo is notable for a couple reasons: 1) It was the first major North American agency in a scene previously dominated by Japanese organizations, and 2) It bills itself as “talent-first,” and unlike many in the space, grants creators under its umbrella IP rights to their Vtuber character (others keep the character if a creator quits or gets fired). Fans were shocked, then, to hear claims that VShojo, the good guy in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-vtuber-industry-corporatization-labor-and-kawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sea of supposed swindlers</a>, was leaving its biggest names high and dry.</p><p>"I don’t think people outside Vtubing understand how crazy this is," an extraterrestrial-themed Vtuber who goes by the handle Serotina <a href="https://x.com/SerotinaVT/status/1947664070573703476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. "VShojo had one of the best reputations of the big corps. The talents always spoke SO highly of VShojo, and many indies aspired to join them, like that was the dream. It’s so unbelievable how hard they fumbled."</p><p>Ironmouse had extra motivation to depart the agency with which she’d become semi-synonymous: She <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/04/20/twitch-ironmouse-vtuber-subathon-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffers from a chronic illness</a> called common variable immune deficiency, or CVID, which leaves her highly susceptible to infection. The money she’s made from streaming has allowed her access to better healthcare, but she remains largely homebound. Helping others in similar situations by raising money for the Immune Deficiency Foundation – which provided her aid when she was “lonely,” “terrified,” and “confused” during the darkest doldrums of her own health decline – is her main cause.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Immune Deficiency Foundation means the world to me. [Streamer friend Connor "CDawgVA" Colquhoun] and I have both spent a ton of energy, time, and resources raising money for charity, and we're both so proud to say that we've raised nearly $4 million for charity,” Ironmouse said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLbGcUMy6g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> explaining why she left VShojo. “The thing that hurts me the most is that the Immune Deficiency Foundation, which is the most important charity to me and also the reason why I’m here today, is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo. … I really want to tell you everything, but unfortunately right now I have been instructed by my attorney to wait for more of the legal procedure to unfold. So one day I will be able to tell you the full story. But for now, I just need to let you know that I will no longer be a part of VShojo.”</p><p>Aftermath reached out to VShojo and the Immune Deficiency Foundation for more details, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.</p><p>Ironmouse’s announcement triggered a cascade of departures; as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> notes, 12 of the 13 Vtubers listed on VShojo’s website have cut ties with the agency in the three days since she posted her video. Others, like fellow massively popular Vtuber Kson, also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBxw80mZoWI&amp;t=236s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that VShojo owed her a “significant” amount of money.</p><p>Before long, freelance artists who’d helped contribute to VShojo projects came out of the woodwork to say that the agency <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/niya.rest/post/3luiyoe5uus2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ghosted them</a> and <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1947477389732200857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to pay them on time</a> – or, in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/shirobeats_/status/1947722359848554706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at all</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Nowhere near what Mouse is going through, but for the past [around a] year VShojo has been habitually late in paying me for commissions, sometimes leaving thousands of dollars of my invoices unpaid for months at a time,” a Vtuber composer who goes by the handle StarlightDaryl <a href="https://x.com/StarlightDaryl/status/1947469018211967090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>, noting that they did eventually receive what they were owed, but only thanks to the efforts of creators and their managers. “I tried to be patient, but knowing they were stealing charity money from Mousey while this was all happening makes me SICK to my stomach."&nbsp;</p><p>Ironmouse <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1947709495888806001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a> that she planned to ensure that all other artists who’d been left waiting would be similarly compensated.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/vortoxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vortoxy</a>, who provides freelance video production services in the Vtuber space, broke down their experience with VShojo.</p><p>"Once the project had been completed they asked me to fill out an invoice, and we agreed that payment would be sent 30 business days later,” Vortoxy told Aftermath. “In my case, I think my payment was sent about 53 or 54 business days later. Once the 30 days had passed, I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask the status of my payment, and often I was met with a message along the lines of ‘let me check with finances’ and then crickets for some time. I think I had asked about three times before I had finally received payment from them. I don't think I've had the worst case by any means, but it seemed a little ridiculous to me that I had to hunt down a payment of $500 from a company of their status."</p><p>Vortoxy added, however, that this wasn’t the first time they’d had to chase down a payment from an agency revealed to be in the throes of money-related woes.&nbsp;</p><p>"Oddly enough, it's been almost a year to the date when MSM Talent was also exposed for owing their Vtuber talents money,” Vortoxy said. “Similar to VShojo, they were an agency who provided backend support to various big indie creators in the space. I worked with them for just shy of a year and never received a single payment for the various projects I did for them until the very end, when a large group of creators were demanding the money they were owed."</p><p>Ultimately, they believe that VShojo is not exactly an outlier in this regard.</p><p>"I honestly do think there is a larger industry issue plaguing the scene,” Vortoxy said. “I have various other freelance creative friends in this space who also have told me their own horror stories of working with different Vtuber corporations or large creators; it's not uncommon. But ultimately I want to emphasize that there's still a lot of good people in this space. I've worked with dozens of Vtubers, both indie and corporate, as well as various companies in this space, and a large majority of the time payment is delivered on time."&nbsp;</p><p>Ironmouse, by most accounts, has done her best to make things right. In addition to saying she will help artists get paid, she’s also hosting <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Tiltify fundraiser for the Immune Deficiency Foundation</a>, with funds going directly to the organization rather than through an intermediary like VShojo. In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lulddzojws2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just a day</a>, her community raised over $500,000 to cover what VShojo owed. The total now sits at nearly $1.2 million.</p><p>"I don't really have words that can properly express how I feel," Ironmouse <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1947883998497083855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. "I feel like saying thank you to everyone is not enough. But thank you all so much for your kindness. My heart is so full it feels like it's going to explode. You all are truly amazing. I'm gonna go cry now."&nbsp;</p><p>With so many Vtubers leaving, VShojo’s future is unclear. But given the reputation of Vtuber agencies large and small for exerting control and, increasingly, failing to provide sufficient benefits in return, some, like <a href="https://x.com/ElaraVtuber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavy metal elf and news commentary Vtuber Elara</a>, believe VShojo’s fall could herald a sea change. Indie Vtubers, she believes, are the future.</p><p>“There is a myriad of reasons some Vtubers choose to go corporate,” she told Aftermath. “However the landscape has evolved quite a bit, and I believe we will see the decline of corporate Vtubing as a whole.”</p><p><strong>Update 7/24/25:</strong> VShojo has shut down.</p><p>"VShojo has failed, and I've mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing," CEO Justin "Gunrun" Ignacio said in <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement posted to Twitter</a>. "So today I am sharing the difficult news that VShojo is shutting down, and I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point."</p><p>Ignacio said that VShojo raised $11 million to pursue "pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing, prioritizing creators and community over short-term profits, to achieve long-term sustainability," but that ultimately, "we ran out of money."</p><p>He also seemingly took responsibility for misspending the money Ironmouse raised during her 2024 marathon stream.</p><p>"I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative," Ignacio wrote. "At the time, we were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts. I made the decision to pursue funding, and I own its consequences."</p><p>"I am deeply sorry to all the talents, staff, friends, and community members who believed in our brand," he concluded. "You did not deserve this."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lollipop-chainsaw-game-reboot-anime-woke-nonsense-dei-back-in-my-day"><h3>Let’s All Read A Shitty Video Game Press Release Together</h3></a><p>'The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without...'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ridge-racer-4-zine-magazine"><h3>Riiiiidddgggeeee Raaaaccceerrrr Ziiiinnnneeeee</h3></a><p>'A tribute to Namco's Ridge Racer Type 4, the vibiest racing game of all time'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-stories-resignations-editor"><h3>This Was Inevitable</h3></a><p>Waypoint 2.0's ordeal is the story of games media in 2025</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-immune-deficiency-foundation-money]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today at San Diego Comic-Con, Critical Role and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1183ce14-1675-44b1-af00-4d7855d7f06c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became" rel="nofollow">Titmouse </a>announced the release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. An animated TV show based on Critical Role's second streamed campaign focusing on the seven members of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. The announcement of a <em>Mighty Nein</em> TV show came in early 2023 after reaching success with the first few season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>, a similarly animated show based on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> group's first campaign.</p>

<p>The release date for <em>The Mighty Nein</em> on Prime Video will be November 19th. It will be releasing in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Alongside the release date announcement, a short sequence from the show was also released showing the majority of the player characters being interrogated. Here we get to see at a glance what each of the characters is about with Beau the monk showing off her guns, Nott the Goblin intoxicated and (poorly) flirting with her interrogator, and Jester being absolutely chaotic.</p>


<p>The description of the show provided reads as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> follows a group of fugitives and outcasts, bound by secrets and scars. But when a powerful arcane relic known as "The Beacon" falls into dangerous hands, they must learn to work together to save the realm and stop reality itself from unraveling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the short clip fans were also treated to artwork of the full party of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> including our first look at Yasha, played by Ashley Johnson (The Last of Us Part II).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mark Strong was credited in an episode of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> for a single episode as an Assembly Mage, this will likely develop into a larger role as Trent Ikithon, a recurring foe for <em>The Mighty Nein.</em></p>

Others are trying to balance how to remember someone who was both arguably one of the most famous wrestlers in history and also, in the eyes of many, a terrible human being who caused a lot of pain, suffering, and trauma.

                <p>In June, Capcom announced a second fan-art contest for Street Fighter 6, where artists could submit entries for a chance to have their art inserted into the game for use in the "Here Comes A New Challenger" screen. A winner was chosen for each of the 26 current roster members, but the winning entry for newcomer Kimberly has stirred up some controversy--namely, allegations that the artwork broke the contest's strict "no AI-generated images" policy.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-kimberly-ai-art-contest-lilithascends-1851786882" rel="nofollow ">Kotaku</a>, an X user named "hoodratt20xx" put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRuYXWbOATa7jxlopgSXwR41pEHKB14zA0oJYjCnPWYwjuzBSRpBOgAEFyLtGZoNdZqMJHDO6KOiWs3/pub" rel="nofollow ">comprehensive Google Doc</a> of what they think are telltale signs of AI use in the winning Kimberly entry as well as entries for other characters. Another X user, Galena_Bismon, shared a similar<a href="https://x.com/Galena_Bismon/status/1948190589461168219" rel="nofollow "> analysis</a> via a post on their feed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537874"></a><figcaption>Kimberly from Street Fighter 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I have reason to believe that one of the winning entries for New Challengers 2 is partially or fully made with AI," hoodratt20xx wrote in the document.

                <p>After similar pressure was placed on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">Steam</a> just last week, another storefront, Itch.io, has followed suit and culled the vast majority of its adult and sexual content. It cites the efforts of the organization Collective Shout, the same group that also went after Steam, as the primary reason for the removal of said games.</p><p>Rumblings of these removals picked up late on July 23, when creators started noticing that games with NSFW tags had been "shadowbanned" on the platform, while some others noted that their games had been entirely pulled. In the early hours of July 24, Itch.io shared a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> confirming the removals and clarifying the circumstances that led to the sweeping changes.</p><p>The statement begins, "We have 'deindexed' all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p><p>It continues, "Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted in Itch.io. Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on Itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and Itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms."</p><p>In both situations, Collective Shout seemingly organized against the storefronts by pressuring their payment processors. Earlier this month, the group penned an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> to these companies accusing them of selling games with sexual-abuse material for profit.</p><p>Itch.io's statement suggests that the "situation developed rapidly" and that the company could not realistically have provided advanced notice to affected creators. It also goes on to say that the company is undergoing a "comprehensive audit of content" to make sure that the content on the store is in compliance with terms that will now be set by its payment processors. Moving forward, the pages that had been "deindexed" will remain as such throughout this audit and all future content tagged as NSFW on the platform will have to undergo further verification.</p><p>These changes come as a blow to Itch.io, which has developed a positive reputation among independent developers in recent years as a bastion for adult and queer content including games and zines. Additionally, the platform has famously implemented a "pay what you want" model that has enabled creators to make more profit and raise money for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-ice-in-california-bundle-raises-defense-funds-with-560-games-for-10/1100-6533022/" data-ref-id="1100-6533022">charity and humanitarian work</a>.</p><p>In response to Itch.io's sweeping changes though, many of its creators and loudest proponents are currently scrambling and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magicariot.com/post/3luoubs5gu22s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">weighing their futures</a> on the platform, as well as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organizing against payment processors</a> to push back on bans they feel are unfairly broad.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft has revealed the launch date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows' first story expansion. It also detailed other significant updates coming as part of the summer stretch of its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-year-1-roadmap-includes-story-expansion-parkour-improvements-new">Year 1 content roadmap</a>.</p><p>Claws of the Awaji, the game’s first big story DLC, is launching on September 16. Set after the conclusion of Shadow’s events (meaning you need to beat the game to unlock it), it centers on Naoe tackling a fresh slate of foes on the new island setting of Awaji. The expansion is touted to feature over 10 hours of content and will be free to players who pre-ordered Shadows. It is unclear how much Claws of Awaji will cost to purchase standalone.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New Game Plus arrives in an update next week on July 29. The mode resets story and objective board progression, but allows players to retain their character level, gear, skill points, knowledge rank, and Hideout progression in a fresh campaign. When starting New Game Plus, players have the option of restarting the story from the very beginning or skipping the prologue and starting when Naoe first acquires the Hideout.</p><p>In terms of progression, the July update also raises the level cap from 60 to 80. New Knowledge Ranks, Mastery, and Knowledge Skill ranks will also be introduced. The Hideout will receive new upgrades, including those for Heiji’s Forge. July 29 will also add Project 3, adding new resources, data files, and exclusive Animus-themed rewards.</p>

<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/780e82d554eac/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> has secured a firm release date on Switch 1 and 2, and with the latter console being more powerful, fans should be excited for what will hopefully be a smoother, more-polished release for the latest entry in the Trails series.</p>
<p>However, ever since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">Switch 2 version's announcement back in June</a>, there's been controversy surrounding it as publisher NIS America confirmed it would be a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/never-in-my-wildest-dreams-would-i-have-expected-this-falcom-president-talks-20-years-of-trails-in-our-big-interview">after our interview with Falcom President Toshihiro Kondo</a> — where representatives of NIS America were present — we asked about why the publisher decided to go with a Game-Key Card release, rather than a full physical version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In a follow-up email, a representative from NIS America responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We decided to release this title as a Game-Key Card on the Nintendo Switch 2 as we believed it was the most beneficial option for our customers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to clarify that, as far as we can tell, a Japanese Switch 2 release hasn't been confirmed for the game yet. As such, this 'physical' version is only confirmed for the West. Another Falcom game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> — which is currently <em>only</em> confirmed for Japan — is also a Game-Key Card release on Switch 2, though that is being handled by Clouded Leopard Entertainment</p>
<p>Regardless, the above response isn't the answer anyone was looking for, and many have taken to social media to criticise. Especially when the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon?variant=42117184127024">special edition of the Switch 2 release is $10 more expensive than any other version</a>, including the PS5 release.</p>
<p>We've asked NIS America to confirm whether there will be an upgrade path for those who want to buy the full physical Switch 1 release and will update this article when we receive a response.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon Switch 2 Special Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e119d950bc95/trails-beyond-the-horizon-switch-2-special-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Game-Key Card releases have gone down like a lead balloon in general, with many refusing to buy them as they're not true physical games — as Nintendo puts it, the cartridge in the box is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview">"your "key" to downloading the full game to your system via the internet".</a></p>
<p>You only need to connect to the internet the first time you boot up the game, but you will need to pop the Game-Key Card into the Switch 2 to play the game, despite the fact the game isn't on the cartridge.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version is a full physical, but we have no details on whether there will be the ability to transfer save data between the Switch 1 and 2 versions, <em>or</em> whether there will be an upgrade path for those who want to buy the physical Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>Some publishers, such as Marvelous and CD Projekt Red, have stuck to full physical releases, but many third-party Switch 2 games — like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, and even future releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a> — are all Game-Key Cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has loved dragons for longer than I can remember, including rocking dragon button-up shirts in high school as my “style” and theming my son’s bedroom around the scaled creatures, I was happy as a wyrm and his hoard when Wizards revealed they were releasing Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This collection puts front and center one of the namesakes of the TTRPG, featuring 10 adventures, while also highlighting the legacy of the creatures in this long-running franchise. After peeling back the pages and seeing what it has to offer, I find this book to be a fine addition to my shelf, but I wish it went further to really give these mythical creatures the celebration they deserve.</p><div catalogid="95c08acb-b2b8-42d6-9e49-69e7fa2c79c4" id="225650"><div id="225650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragon Delves (D&amp;D Adventure Anthology)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Delves is a collection of 10 short adventures, each one focused around chromatic (Green, Red, Blue, White, Black) or Metallic (Gold, Silver, Brass, Bronze, Copper) dragons that can be dropped into your existing campaigns or played back-to-back in a campaign that takes players from novice level 1 heroes up to level 12. It would have been nice if the designers offered some manner or tips, or recommendations for GMs to adjust the included quests for higher levels, but worst case, you could always just choose higher level enemies of a similar style, young dragons instead of wyrmlings, for example, to raise the challenge.  There is a good variety of quests in this anthology, from solving mysteries behind corruption, sentient bags of holding, or uncovering forgotten verses of a song, but all of them will, at some point, have you and your party cross paths with a dragon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All but one really hit for me. The one that didn't is the Gold Dragon’s adventure, “Baker’s Doesn't,” which involves a golden dragon named Briochebane that bakes bread, and has the party dealing with animated candy creations and visiting places like Candied Apple Orchards and Taffy Factories. Outlandish and silly in TTRPGs isn’t an automatic turn-off for me. Hell, in my own homebrew campaign, the party encountered an island of sentient vegetables and took a cauliflower puppy back with them. But in the scheme of Dragon Delves, this quest just doesn’t feel like it belongs among quests like “Death at Sunset” or “Shivering Death”. That said, its whimsical nature could be perfect for a little jaunt in the Feywild or to add a bit of levity to your campaign after an emotionally-packed couple of sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign. Each of the 10 stories has been designed to last only one or two sessions, with the first page of each one providing simple and clear directions on where these can be dropped in, the level of characters it is for, the general plot points, how to prepare, and what state blocks you will need.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Silver Dragon’s “The Will of Orcus” adventure states, “It can take place anywhere there are mountains and settlements,” and is for level 4 characters. All of those important bits of information you need can be gleaned from just a quick glance. As a GM, the faster I can get the info, the better, and I think the layout and design are wonderfully done here in Dragon Delves (and honestly, all of the updated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-dungeons-and-dragons-books">2025 5th edition books</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing of note, while this anthology contains the details of the adventures, it does <em>not</em> have any stat blocks for the creatures, so whoever is running these will also need the Monster Manual (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QObWlM?object_uuid=450dc3bd-3d44-47f6-b69a-cf14e99c5ce7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>) – either 5th Edition book will suffice. The fact that this book doesn’t contain any unique stat blocks is a bit of a bummer. I would have loved to have blocks for each of the 10 dragons that are the focus of each one, which would give them something slightly unique or tweaked from their stock counterparts in the Monster Manual. Also, where are my updated gem dragons at, Wizards?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the quests, this book also showcases how the visuals and designs of each dragon have evolved over the course of Dungeons &amp; Dragons' nearly five-decade-long lifespan. I appreciate the two-page spread of artwork, but when I heard that this book would also showcase the history of the dragon types, I expected more. I would have loved to see blurbs from Wizards’ designers on how, if any, the approach and gameplay design of the various types have shifted or changed over the years. How has Wizards approached its stat blocks, or despite “dragons” being in the franchise's name, why is the team as reserved in showcasing or highlighting them? Much of this art I could obtain simply by searching Google; give me the information or material that has been hoarded away in the Wizards’ vaults. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether they are spewing acid, lightning, or breathing the more traditional fire, dragons have been, and always will be, really, really cool. There is a reason that these scaled creatures have become so closely ingrained and intertwined with the fantasy genre. Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology gives players some relatively quick outings to enjoy and drop into their story whenever parties have a hankering for some dragon goodness. That said, this book never reached the heights of excitement I had imagined when I first heard about it. The fact that it relies solely on the basic stat blocks from the Monster Manual and there aren’t any fun adventures for higher-level parties is a bit disappointing. The fact that Tiamat, arguably the most recognizable dragon in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is absent is also a strange omission.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Devles comes off more as a great introductory package for dragons, and for newer or younger players just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">learning how to play D&amp;D</a>, it's a fun collection of quick stories. But for more experienced players, or those hoping for setups for big confrontations with some ancient dragons, you may want to look elsewhere. Personally, I was hoping for and expecting more, but hopefully this anthology just marks the beginning of more dragon-centric books and campaigns to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Unfortunately, it also soft locks your game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has been out for a week now, and speedrunners are already figuring out incredibly fast ways to beat the game in as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcjkdLofDYg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little as an hour and a half</a>. While they're sure to find ways to cut that time down even more in the coming weeks and months, one really interesting trick has been discovered with a strange side effect: it skips getting Pauline as DK's companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>Spoilers for the ending of Donkey Kong Bananza's Lagoon Layer follow. Read on at your own risk!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a normal playthrough, Pauline bursts out of Odd Rock near the end of the Lagoon Layer when she and DK play music together and activate DK's Kong Bananza transformation. It's a critical story moment both in that it actually introduces Pauline into the story proper, but also because the cutscene is required to get Kong Elder to open the door to the next layer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speedrunners have found a trick that lets them skip the whole thing. The drop to the next layer is hidden in a building that DK can actually clip into under the right circumstances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIvPjCDwvLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This video</a> shows the trick in action, but it essentially involves hanging from a pipe close to a barred window into the building, and rapidly entering and exiting Photo Mode to get DK to clip through the bars and into the room with the hole. This works regardless of whether DK has Pauline or not, which means DK and Odd Rock can journey to the next layer together without progressing the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for Odd Rock lovers out there, you can't actually progress the game much farther this way. The next sublayer is a boss fight arena, and while you can collect a few Banandium Gems in there with Odd Rock's support, the boss won't actually spawn if you don't have Pauline with you. Weirdly, you will hear a bit of Pauline's (not Odd Rock's) dialogue as you approach the arena, but with no boss to fight there's also no way to manifest the big hole in the ground that leads to the next main layer. So you're soft locked until you go back and properly get Pauline.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, knowing how fast speedrunners work at breaking these things, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear about them solving this new problem sometime soon and doing something that results in some crazy no-Pauline tricks, or maybe even ways to skip Odd Rock entirely. After all, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom runners <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-speedrunner-finds-a-way-to-play-as-link">figured out how to play as Link instead of Zelda</a>. Video games are just wacky like that sometimes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is out now, and we love it, having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">given the game a 10/10 in our review</a>. As our reviewer said, "Donkey Kong Bananza is a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer, with satisfying movement, powerful abilities, impressive destructible environments, and clever challenges that all come together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like us, can't get enough of Bananza, we have plenty of walkthroughs to aid your journey underground, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Banandium_Gems_(Banana_Locations)">Banandium Gem locations</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Essential_Tips_to_Get_Started">starter tips and tricks</a>, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Walkthrough">full walkthrough</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> recently spoke with Kenichiro Tsukuda, the producer of the mech <a title="Genres > Action [2,887 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> series <em><a title="Games > Daemon X Machina [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daemon-x-machina">Daemon X Machina</a></em>, to discuss the upcoming <a title="Genres > Open-World [683 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> sequel <em><a title="Games > Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</a></em>. Tsukuda shared more about the game’s horseback traversal, <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [558 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, open world, enemies, overhauled skill system, game length, and more. <span id="more-979773"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>Horseback traversal is a new feature. How has this impacted mission design overall? Will there be combat tied to horseback movement, or is it mainly a tool for exploration?</strong></p><p><strong>Kenichiro Tsukuda, Series Producer:</strong> “Yes, you can engage in combat on horseback. Traveling in your arsenal consumes energy, but you don’t consume energy when riding a horse or other using other vehicles. It’s also fun to travel around with friends, whether that’s by flying or by utilizing vehicles. I believe horses do not detract from the sci-fi or mech genres in any way, as they have long-existed in sci-fi novels, and I believe they are actually necessary to pay respect to the novelists who pioneered this genre.”</p><p><strong>With <a title="Genres > Co-Op [306 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> confirmed for the main campaign, can the full story be played through with three players? Or are there limitations to which missions support multiplayer?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “There are no restrictions at all. Everything is playable in co-op. However, while players at a higher levels can sync to those at a lower level, lower-leveled players will not be able to join the games of higher-leveled players. This is because most players prefer to avoid spoilers and don’t want to jump ahead in the story.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Asynchronous multiplayer is also new to the series. Can you elaborate on how it functions? Will players encounter shared events, custom challenges, or ongoing threats?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “The entire story can be enjoyed in co-op, so you can face all enemy threats and in-game events with other players. Through asynchronous multiplayer, players can create bases in the open world that other players can interact with. You can access the same functions at these bases out in the field as you would be able to at your own home base. Additionally, if you find another player’s wreckage out in the world, you can obtain items or equipment from them. The player who fell in battle doesn’t lose these items if another player takes them. This means that even if you die in the game, you’ll still be helping someone out, which makes for a more carefree and enjoyable experience. There are other features as well, but we’ll discuss those at another time.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Daemon-X-Machina-Interview_07-24-25_SS01.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The game is described as featuring a “vast” open world. How does this approach contrast with the mission-based structure of the original? Are there dynamic encounters like world bosses, faction-controlled zones, or other random objectives? And how do you ensure the world feels alive, avoiding the emptiness seen in parts of the first game?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “Players can look forward to encountering random missions and events in the open world, and it’s great to explore as well. We designed it more like an <a title="Genres > RPG [17,434 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, really. Even weak enemies often drop new items, so there’s always excitement in finding new enemies. As a game centered around combat, <em>Titanic Scion</em> always has something in store that makes you want to keep progressing.</p><p>“And exploration is more than just seeing what’s around the next corner. You can do things with other players like share secret maps with each other that I hope will lead to more players wanting to play co-op with their friends.”</p><p><strong>You’ve mentioned the addition of organic enemies. Are these a completely new class of enemy? How do they differ from mechanical enemies in terms of strategy, behavior, or vulnerabilities?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “They are indeed a new type of enemy. However, they are not entirely organic. They are the result of mechanical entities repeatedly fusing with biological organisms. Enemy behavior and weaknesses are individually set for each enemy, so rather than saying organic enemies are different from mechanical enemies, it’s more accurate to say that each enemy is unique. However, as a general rule, mechanical enemies are weak against energy-based weapons like lasers, while biological enemies are weak against projectile-based weapons.”</p><p><strong>Can players expect any new customization features that go beyond what was possible in the original? Are there any new systems added to the mech building?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “One addition is that you can now create your own emblems, which opens up new ways to play. For example, you can create a ‘team’ emblem with friends in the new and improved online mode. Additionally, while not necessarily a customization feature, you can now carry items that boost attack power and healing, making the game more accessible for beginners in a group. In terms of customization for your Arsenal, there are now more weapons available to equip, along with changes to equipment slots, new weapon types, and additional functionalities based on different weapons. These all add more depth to customization.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Daemon-X-Machina-Interview_07-24-25_SS02.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The visual style seems to be more realistic this time around, compared to the more heavily cel-shaded look of the original. Was this shift primarily to support a darker narrative tone, or were there other design / technical factors at play?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “I thought a lot about our visual aesthetic. While the first <em>Daemon X Machina</em> had an anime-style aesthetic, this one adopts techniques closer to Japanese manga, specifically Gekiga, with some photorealism influence as well. The characters are more manga-inspired, while the mecha designs lean toward photorealism. Because we are releasing on multiple platforms, we aimed to appeal to a wide audience, including anime and manga fans, and fans of the first game.”</p><p><strong>The Axiom are introduced as new antagonists. While avoiding any major spoilers, how do they compare to the Immortals in terms of goals, combat style, or threat level?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “Compared to regular small enemies, Axiom Soldiers often appear in groups and can be quite challenging until you’re properly equipped. Additionally, bosses like the Neun use special skills that are far more advanced than the mercenaries from the first <em>Daemon X Machina</em>, so be careful when challenging them. Of course, defeating them allows you to obtain the powerful skills they use.”</p><p><strong>Are skills a brand-new progression layer—such as a dedicated skill tree—or do they build on the existing augment system from the original?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “We completely overhauled the skill system. Instead of a skill tree, you acquire and equip skills through factors and genetic patterns obtained by defeating enemies. These skills are divided into two types. Active skills are used during combat and function similarly to spells or special moves in an RPG, while passive skills enhance your physical prowess. Of course, the augmentation system for armor and weapons is still present as well.”</p><p><strong>In terms of narrative length, how does this entry compare to the roughly 15-hour runtime of the original game?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “For all but the most hardcore players who may be able to speed through the story, playing the entire game will require acquiring proper equipment. The process of gearing up and becoming stronger is a core fun element of this game, after all, so it should take players longer to play through this game than the first <em>Daemon X Machina</em>.”</p><p><strong>Is there a final message you would like to share with the Gematsu audience before you sign off from this interview?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “Even within the sci-fi genre, the mech subgenre can be viewed as quite niche. However, to those who may not have considered mech games before, <em>Titanic Scion</em> offers appealing characters, a helpful community through online co-op, and an RPG-inspired design that allows players to overcome challenges not just through action alone, but by exploring the world and upgrading their equipment. My goal for <em>Titanic Scion</em> was to create a mech game that even beginners would enjoy.

<p><a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/2687311">Linked takedown notices</a> on some of those pages outline the specific types of content that are being targeted in itch.io's new crackdown:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don't allow hosting content that includes sexualized images or videos of real-life humans. Fictional, illustrated, and rendered content is generally fine, assuming it's legal. AI-generated imagery that is designed to resemble photographic content of real people is not allowed. Content glorifying sexual violence is not permitted. Depictions of minors, minor-presenting, or suggested minors in a sexual context are not allowed and will result in account suspension.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those notices also link to applicable "Acceptable Use Policies" from <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/acceptableuse-full">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses">Stripe</a>, and <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/legal/restricted-businesses/">Payoneer</a> that itch.io says must be followed "if you plan to collect money for your content."</p>
<p>On <a href="https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed">its creator FAQ page</a>, itch.io adds that "it’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time." The platform also notes that "violations that result in administrative action are permanent with no chance of appeal. Any funds on the account will not be eligible for payout. There is no second chance."</p>
<h2>What it means to be “deindexed”</h2>
<p>As the audit continues, tens of thousands of adult games that are technically available on the platform (for now) exist in the limited visibility limbo of "deindexing." While these games can still be accessed, purchased, and downloaded by those who follow a direct link to their itch.io pages, they will no longer appear in searches or individual user recommendations on the platform, vastly limiting their reach.</p>

    <div id="caption-2108051"><p>
              There were a lot more than 48 "adult" tagged games on itch.io until quite recently.

<p>That deindexing effect can be seen by simply browsing through many once-popular adult content tags on itch.io. Browsing the "Adult" tag that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250724091512/https://itch.io/games/tag-adult">included nearly 17,000 games last week</a>, for instance, now shows <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-adult">just 48 titles as of this writing</a> (extremely NSFW links, obviously). Other itch.io tags that have seen their previously robust browsable content severely limited include "Erotic," "Hentai," "Incest," "NSFW," "Porn," "Rape," "Sex," and "Sexy."</p>
<p>It isn't just sexualized games that have been caught up in this deindexing dragnet, though. Indie developer Robert Boyd <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zeboydgames.bsky.social/post/3luolxe6tqs2f">notes on Bluesky</a> that <em>Consume Me</em>—an <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards">award-winning game</a> about eating disorders—will no longer show up in search results on itch.io, even if you <a href="https://itch.io/search?q=consume+me">seek it out by name directly</a> (it can still be found <a href="https://q_dork.itch.io/consume-me">using this direct URL</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=consume+me+site%3Aitch.io">outside search engines like Google</a>).</p>

Most content creators are trying to get viral soundbites in their interviews, but streamer and YouTuber Loserfruit had a much better idea and asked Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn to try out their respective heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span>. So if you’ve ever wanted to see Pascal use Mister Fantastic’s stretchy limbs to help claim an objective, you can finally do that now.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Loserfruit sat down with the <em>First Steps </em>cast and had each of them jump into <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’s practice range to try out their heroes. Pascal played as Mister Fantastic, Kirby controlled Invisible Woman, Moss-Bachrach did some clobbering as the Thing, and Quinn ignited the skies as Human Torch. Before they get started, Kirby says she loves playing games, and Pascal mentions she’s big on <em>The Sims</em>. The rest of the crew says they have pretty limited gaming experience. Quinn played <em>FIFA</em> as a kid and Pascal says he never played anything past the original NES. So by and large, it sounds like the actors are about to enter uncharted territory playing NetEase’s hero shooter.</p><p>Loserfruit shows the cast some of the cosmetics in the game, including Invisible Woman’s wildly popular Malice skin depicting her villainous alter ego, which was a real crowd-pleaser. It seems like a missed opportunity to not have the actors play with the skins <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015">based on their movie appearances</a></span>, but those unfortunately aren’t live until tomorrow, July 25, so the default skins will have to do.</p><p>The actors all face a bit of a learning curve, and Pascal even jokes about needing “console classes” to learn how to play. After some time in the practice range, the group entered a real online game, but Loserfruit asked the other players to “pls be nice” to the actors in chat. The cast passed the controller around during a match, and it wasn’t until Pascal played that any of them managed to get a kill on the enemy Venom. Well, an assist, but let’s not get technical.</p><p>Check out the full video below:</p><p>All four actors are pretty busy right now, so it’s not like they have time to become pro gamers in the midst of promoting <em>First Steps </em>and shooting their upcoming MCU appearances in <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>.

<p dir="ltr">While the number of approved foreign games has increased in recent years due to the approval process now occurring monthly instead of every two months, there was a period from July 2021 to March 2022 when no new games were approved for release. Last month, China approved a record 158 new games for release--a multi-year high according to Chinese news outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/china-approves-158-new-game-licenses-in-june" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yicai Global</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big win for Blizzard, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-pc-titles-will-return-to-china-under-new-deal-with-netease/1100-6522533/" data-ref-id="1100-6522533">re-partnered with Chinese gaming giant NetEase in 2024</a> to re-release games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 in China following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-and-netease-breakup-came-after-bobby-kotick-felt-threatened/1100-6512792/" data-ref-id="1100-6512792">licensing disagreements</a> that saw many Blizzard's titles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chinese-wow-servers-shut-down-after-14-years-following-expiration-of-netease-agreement/1100-6510829/" data-ref-id="1100-6510829">including WoW</a>, go offline in the region for most of 2023 and some of 2024. It was during this period when many Blizzard games were unplayable in China that Diablo 4 released globally in June 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard and NetEase have not yet announced an official release date for Diablo 4 in China, but when it does arrive, it will likely include a number of changes from the version the rest of the world plays. Previous Blizzard games in China have operated on their own separate, region-locked clients and servers and often receive region-exclusive events and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chinese versions of Blizzard games often bring various content changes in order to conform to Chinese government regulations. In the case of Diablo 4, that will likely mean less gore, fewer skeletons, and the removal of certain religious references. One thing is for certain, the Diablo 4 Necromancer and their skeletal minions will almost certainly look different in the Chinese version.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Diablo 4 news, Blizzard seems poised to bring big changes to its flagship ARPG, as content creators were recently treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse of the game's future</a>.

                <p>Following Microsoft's latest mass layoffs that affected around 9,000 people--including dramatic cuts at Xbox--CEO Satya Nadella sent a memo to staff that was shared on <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's blog.</a> In the memo to staff, Nadella addressed what he called the "why, what, and how" of the decision to cut so many jobs.</p><p>Nadella said the decisions that led to the layoffs were "among the most difficult we have to make."</p><p>"I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful," he said.</p><p>Nadella also addressed what he called the "seeming incongruence" of how Microsoft made these dramatic cuts at a time when business is booming. Nadella said Microsoft is "thriving" by "every objective measure," but he chalked the layoffs up to "the enigma of success."</p><p>"Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before," he said.</p><p>Also in the memo, Nadella said when Bill Gates founded Microsoft decades ago, he did so with the belief that Microsoft could become a "software factory" that was "unconstrained by any single product or category." That idea is "no longer enough," Nadella said, adding that Microsoft needs to "reimagine" what its mission is. Microsoft is betting on AI, as it's investing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">$80 billion</a> into building out the technology and planning to bake AI into every product it makes, including Xbox.</p><p>"Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them. And consider how organizations, empowered with AI, could unlock entirely new levels of agility and innovation by transforming decision-making, streamlining operations, and enabling every team to achieve more together than ever before," Nadella said in his pitch for AI.</p><p>Going forward, Nadella said Microsoft will focus on three main areas: security, quality, and "AI transformation." For AI, Nadella said Microsoft will "reimagine every layer of the tech stack," including the infrastructure, app platform, apps, and AI "agents."</p><p>"Our differentiation will come from how we bring these layers together to deliver end-to-end experiences and products, with the core ethos of a platform company that fosters ecosystem opportunity broadly. Getting both the product and platform right for the AI wave is our North Star," Nadella said.</p><p>Regarding company culture, Nadella said team structures are changing, and things could get messy. "It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere," he said.</p><p>The cuts at Xbox included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">layoffs, game cancellations, and the closure of at least one studio. </a>It was later reported that developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King said they were <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set to be replaced by the tools they helped build.</a> For its part, Microsoft has said it expects the rise of AI to lead to job losses in the near term, but that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">the opportunities that AI presents outweigh the challenges.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>11 Bit Studios has announced the console launch date for Frostpunk 2, which will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles on <strong>September 18, 2025</strong>. </p>



<p>While the release date was announced with a new trailer for the console's launch, it seems like the news has accidentally gone live early, since the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whxlgvwTZIk"> trailer published to YouTube is now set to private</a>. That doesn't mean you can't see the trailer elsewhere, since it was still downloaded and published by others before it was private.</p>



<p>And to match the fact that Frostpunk 2 is available in Xbox Game Pass for PC, it'll be available in Xbox Game Pass for console players when it launches in September.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Frostpunk 2 | Console Date Reveal Trailer</p><p>Coming to Day One on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on September 18th, 2025 <a href="https://t.co/oOaop5H5ow">pic.twitter.com/oOaop5H5ow</a></p></div>— VGT Gaming News (@GAMERNEWSonX) <a href="https://twitter.com/GAMERNEWSonX/status/1948392802900979880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Along with the console launch, there are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/11-bit-studios-reveals-revised-roadmap-for-frostpunk-2-console-ports-arriving-in-summer/">two more DLC expansions </a>currently scheduled to arrive before the end of this year as part of a previously revealed roadmap for the game, and a third, unnamed DLC set to arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate for 11 Bit Studios that an announcement which seemingly wasn't meant to go live today has done so, but exciting for console players who have been eagerly awaiting its arrival on PS5 and Xbox Series devices since the game first launched on PC last September to strong reviews. </p>



<p>Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/">adored it when he reviewed it last year</a>, writing, "<em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others."</em></p>

                <p>One battle royale after another. After prolific <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">crossovers with Superman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantastic-four-nikes-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6533214/" data-ref-id="1100-6533214">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a>, Fortnite appears to be gearing up for a collaboration with the film One Battle After Another. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the upcoming thriller, slated for a September 26 theatrical release, isn't what anyone would consider fodder for Fortnite, making this crossover all the more intriguing.</p><p>The official Instagram account for the film put out a brief teaser, recreating a scene from the movie in which DiCaprio's character (replaced by Fortnite protagonist Jonesy in this teaser video) answers a covert call at a phone booth. "There are no hands on the clock. #OneBattleAfterAnother x Fortnite coming soon," the video's caption reads.</p><p>It's unclear what kind of content will come out of this collaboration, including whether it will take the form of skins based on the movie's characters or any missions given by NPCs on the battle royale map. Perhaps it'll be a Fortnite Creative experience with the purpose of promoting the film, but it's hard to imagine what that would look like.</p><p>One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio's character, an ex-revolutionary, reuniting with other fellow activists after an old enemy of theirs reemerges. The film also stars Sean Penn as the film's antagonist and Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, and Teyana Taylor in supporting roles.</p><p>The possibility of playing as Leonardo DiCaprio or Sean Penn in Fortnite is pretty hysterical. Now it's hard not to imagine characters from Anderson's extensive filmography joining the fray-- picture Barry Egan from Punch-Drunk Love or Dirk Diggler from Boogie Nights wielding a pickaxe and running alongside a humanoid fish and a banana with limbs.</p><p>In the meantime, Fortnite studio Epic Games is still trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-plan-to-get-fortnite-back-on-ios-has-hit-a-snag-in-the-uk/1100-6533394/" data-ref-id="1100-6533394">get the title playable on iOS in the UK</a>. This comes after an extended legal battle that resulted in Fortnite's return to the US iOS App Store and the Epic Games Store in the EU iOS App Store.</p>

Some, like this writer, are still fairly early on in DK's latest outing, whilst others, such as our very own Liam Doolan, are already done with the thing. No messing around there!</p>
<p>Now, very mild spoilers ahead, but by way of some of the old 'water-cooler' banter (proving once and for all that such a thing can even exist betwixt online colleagues), Liam shared with us that he'd actually managed to complete the game without unlocking one of Donkey Kong's transformations.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Further to this, he hasn't even completed one of the layers. He skipped the entire frozen area of the game. All that lovely snow!</p>
<p>After a quick look online, and it seems Nintendo Life's crack squad of pro gamers aren't the only ones finding lots of new ways to beat the game and/or skip things in the name of speedrunning. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m2ud1r/you_can_completely_skip_freezer_layer_and_zebra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">r/DonkeyKong</a>, people are already sharing Liam's trick, along with a whole bunch of other ways to beat the game quickly.</p>

<p>Some of these techniques can be a little spoilery, so take care.</p>
<p>The video below, meanwhile, gives an indication of the sorts of things gamers are already doing in terms of mechanics, rather than simply skipping things.</p>
<p>There's some real potential here, as this post exclaims, as the Bananza transformations can be freely switched between once engaged. As seen in the vid, entire areas can be avoided if you use the right moves at the right time.</p>

<p>Another post on the forum claims to have only unlocked two of the five total Bananza transformations in the game, so we can only imagine that there's plenty more shenanigans ahead in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>We're genuinely feeling quite tired just considering trying some of this stuff. Whatever happened to just taking your sweet time, y'know?</p>

			<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6ogkWkxq1HusqpqGtQvCpn/assassins-creed-shadows-summer-roadmap-update">announced</a> its summer update for the Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap, including the reveal that new game plus is getting added to the game next week, the player level cap is getting an increase, and the Claws of Awaji DLC is launching on <strong>September 16, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>As far as what's coming next week, on July 29, 2025, Ubisoft is pushing an update for Assassin's Creed Shadows that will add new game plus, a level cap increase from 60 to 80, and some new Animus-related collectibles, and the arrival of Project 3. For new game plus, it'll be available once you've played through the final story mission and seen the credits roll, and all your gear, hideout progression, skill points, and character level will stay the same when starting a new game plus run. Discovered location, objective, and storyboard progression will all be reset. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Later in the summer in August, Ubisoft will push another update that adds a few quality of life updates players have been asking for, like being able to unfog the entire map by synchronizing every viewpoint in the game, and for PC players, Ubisoft is uncapping the framerate in cutscenes, so the game won't be swapping back and forth between a capped and uncapped framerate. Ubisoft is also giving players the chance to voice their concerns and feedback directly to the development team, with a Reddit AMA set for August 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The last highlight of today's announcement is the Claws of Awaji release date, set for September 16, 2025. This is also when a few more quality of life updates will go live, like being able to swap the time of day on the fly, and plenty of new gear rarities and equipment that'll come alongside the DLC.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ubisoft celebrated Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">hitting 5 million players</a> since launch, amid one of the company's other major franchises, Rainbow Six Siege, performing below expectations.</p>
