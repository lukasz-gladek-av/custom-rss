            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301557/new-york-times-connections-creator-take-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The New York Times</em> wants to shut down a copy of its popular <em>Connections</em> word game. The publication sent a cease and desist letter to the owner of <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/">a website</a> that lets you make your own <em>Connections</em> games. The site also has a full archive of all of the <em>NYT’s</em> past <em>Connections</em> puzzles, which the <em>NYT</em> keeps behind a paywall.</p><p>The <em>Connections</em> creator website is built and run by Anthony Salazar, a freelance web developer who runs the creative studio <a href="https://swellgarfo.com/">Swellgarfo</a>. Earlier this month, striking <em>New York Times</em> tech workers used Salazar’s <em>Connections</em> tool to make their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289634/nyt-tech-guild-connections-strike-edition-custom-creator">own strike-themed puzzle</a>. Salazar previously told me that he built the archive using the <em>NYT’s</em> publicly available API.</p><p>In the letter, which Salazar shared with <em>The Verge</em>, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel alleges that the website “unlawfully copies and reproduces” <em>Connections</em>, which constitutes “trademark and copyright infringement in violation of The Times’s intellectual property rights.” The letter also says that the <em>NYT</em> has three trademark applications pending in connection with <em>Connections</em>.</p><p>Salazar has been given three business days to take down the site. If that doesn’t happen, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel says it’s “prepared to take further action if necessary to protect its valuable intellectual property rights,” such as filing a lawsuit.</p><p>Salazar tells <em>The Verge</em> that he will “definitely take down the archive.” But he wants to keep the creator open, saying that it’s used by schools globally. “It’s not like I am getting paid for it or competing with their users (of which I am one),” Salazar says. He’s not sure about the specific timeline for when things might happen, though.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> says people should just play <em>Connections</em> on its website. “Mr. Salazar’s website violates the intellectual property rights of <em>The New York Times</em>,” spokesperson Jordan Cohen says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Anyone looking to play the original <em>Connections</em> game can do so for free on <em>The Times’s</em> own platforms. Those looking to solve puzzles from the <em>Connections</em> archive can do so by subscribing to <em>New York Times</em> Games.”</p><div><p>The <em>NYT</em> targeted <em>Wordle</em> clones with legal takedowns <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094234/ny-times-wordle-clones-files-dmca-copyright-takedowns-knockoffs">earlier this year</a>. The publication has also warned AI search engine Perplexity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270774/new-york-times-cease-and-desist-letter-perplexity-ai-search-engine">to stop using its content</a> and is suing OpenAI and Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">for copyright infringement</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And although the opening fortnight’s craziness is beginning to calm down, it’s still a surprisingly pricy collection.</p><p>Cards have held their value well into the second week, when we’d normally see them crashing down, though I still strongly suspect we’ll see a bunch of those prices dropping by the end of November.</p><p>However, I think what we’re seeing with Surging Sparks is another of the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>’s occasional peaks, those moments when it grabs the zeitgeist once again and everyone’s jumping in for a bit of speculation. That’s likely driven in part by the expectations for January’s new set, Prismatic Evolutions—a set that has already sold out on early pre-orders because of its focus on Eevee-lutions. Everyone always goes nuts over those, and it’s likely to see prices that make Surging Sparks’ look minimal.</p><p>I’ve ripped open about 60 packs of Surging Sparks (in part thanks to The Pokémon Company, who sent <em>Kotaku</em> a hefty pile), and haven’t had good luck at all. Pull rates seem about standard for 2023-24, a disappointing one in five for a standard ex or better, and far lower if you want to see any of the astonishing number of gorgeous artworks in the set.</p><p>It’s getting to a point where it just feels silly to let artists create so much beautiful work, and then make it so phenomenally difficult for anyone to see any of it. And given Pokémon isn’t seeing any of the profits made by those reselling them, the financial incentive is only in hoping that people will just buy more packs to try to find them. But given that everyone’s getting used to the horrible chances, that’s not a great long-term strategy. Grimly, I managed to get <em>three</em> of the ghastly full-art Bruxish cards (the art is great, the Pokémon is hideous), and comprehensively missed out on any of the 35 different cards I’d hoped to pull. The full-art Castform is lovely, though, and I’m pleased to have it.</p><p>Still, you may have been far luckier. Usually when we put these articles together, there’s one card teetering at around a hundred bucks, and then it’s down into the teens by card five or six. Not so in Surging Sparks.</p><p><em>As ever, all prices are correct at the time of writing, but these things change pretty rapidly.

God knows why anyone’s paying <strong>$26 </strong>for a gold version of a bland  Trainer card, with the useful but not exciting ability to pull a Pokémon or Energy card from your discard pile. While gold cards used to hold some collectability, that faded with Sword &amp; Shield, with TPCi desperately trying to reinvigorate interest with a series of quickly abandoned alternatives. (Those green and gold ones? Bleurgh.)</p><p>Even sillier, there’s a much nicer Alolan Exeggutor ex gold card that’s in 12th place, at $23, and Night Stretcher is even out-pricing the Ultra Rare version of the Pikachu ex card everyone’s going so nuts over, which is in 11th place at $24. Ludicrous.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-recommend-id="image://6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jasmine’s Gaze Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jasmine’s Gaze Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-recommend-id="image://6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jasmine’s Gaze Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The art on this card is just so special.

Also, play spot the Alcremie.</p><p>In a normal set, the “other” special art with the girl on it would normally be fetching around 15 bucks, but in the extra-expensive Surging Sparks, this is still going for <strong>$36</strong>, crashing down from its early high of $83.</p><p>It’s also a very useful Trainer card, given it gives all your cards a 30HP buffer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-recommend-id="image://e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Latios Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Latios Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-recommend-id="image://e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Latios Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Quite how TPCi determines which cards are “Illustration Rare” and which are “Special Illustration Rare” is deeply mysterious.

A 150 attack AND you can attach <em>any number</em> of energy cards to <em>any</em> of your Pokémon! Sorry for the italics, but <em>good grief</em>, because that’s the <em>minor</em> attack. Swinging Sphene then gives you a 50:50 chance to knock out your opponent’s active Pokémon (albeit Basics only), and even if it misses you knock out one on the bench!</p><p>Sorry, I’ve got to go build an Exeggutor deck immediately.

<p><br>After first being announced in 2010, STALKER 2 is out now for Xbox Series and PC. And despite more positive reception than negative, there are still technical issues with STALKER 2 that have caused some problems for players. </p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the game’s developers at GSC Game World expressed their joy of the game finally being available to players. That said, they did acknowledge that the game has some “rough edges” that will be worked on as they monitor the feedback of players.</p>



<p>“We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven’t released anything of this scale before,” they said. “We’re absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention.”</p>



<h6 id="h-guides-improve-your-stalker-2-experience">GUIDES: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Improve Your STALKER 2 Experience</a></h6>



<p>They continued to say that over the next few days, they will be working on various hotfixes for the game and will release them “as precisely as possible” while still being as frequent as they can. After those are out, the focus will move to larger updates for the game.</p>



<p>“There will also be free in-game content — we’ll share its roadmap later in December,” they said. “We have big plans for the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Taylor-Hill reviewed the game</a>, and says that despite any technical hiccups early on, STALKER 2 is “the cream of the crop, and it’s a bar to which every developer in the genre should aspire to reach.”</p>



<p>Have you had any major issues with STALKER 2 in your early play? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

IGN has reported on Space Marine 2’s modding scene already, shining a light on everything from customization to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-solves-one-of-the-games-biggest-problems">a fix for one of the game’s biggest problems</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, the changes Space Marine 2 mods make to the Space Marines themselves, whether they’re a purely aesthetic customization not normally possible or certain classes using weapons and equipment they’re not supposed to, can be seen online by other players in public PvE sessions. While Space Marine 2 uses dedicated servers, a lot of the game elements are client-side controlled. So if you’re playing with random players, there’s a chance you might see things like Bulwarks wielding Thunder Hammers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding"><u>Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment had confirmed to IGN that it had no problem whatsoever with PvE modding</u></a>, but now, in <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/114-mod-support-a-message-from-the-game-director" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message to modders</a>, game director Dmitriy Grigorenko has announced changes that impact how Space Marine 2 mods work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grigorenko said Saber had found that a “non-negligible” amount of recent server stability issues were related to mods, and pointed out that instability impacts even those users who don’t have mods installed. Saber has also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with the release of Space Marine 2’s next big update in December, mods will be blocked from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed, Grigorenko warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods will still be allowed in private Operations lobbies, however (Space Marine 2 includes three-player co-op missions as part of Operations mode). “We will continue to provide all necessary server infrastructure so you can play online with your friends with mods,” Grigorenko promised. “Once we add custom Eternal War lobbies, mods will work for them as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber will also help Space Marine 2 modders out by providing an easy entry point to its backend for games with mods installed, “so modders won’t have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch.” “If we somehow break this pipeline for mods by accident in the future, we’ll fix it,” Grigorenko vowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the big one: Saber will release “some” of its tools to modders so they can develop mods with greater ease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tom, aka Warhammer Workshop, creator of the popular Astartes Overhaul mod for Space Marine 2, hailed the news, saying official modding tools means no more reverse-engineering. “With official tools on the way, we’re entering a new golden age of modding,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By moving mods to private and custom lobbies, public servers will stay smooth while modded games get the infrastructure they deserve,” Tom said. “Mods are now a supported part of Space Marine 2, ensuring our creativity continues to enhance the game for years to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tom acknowledged some Space Marine 2 players and modders might feel disappointed that mods won’t work in public lobbies anymore. “But let’s be honest,” he countered, “the other alternative was mods getting shut down completely. Instead, Saber has embraced our community and creativity. This is a huge win for everyone!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And it's using data collected by Pokémon Go players to do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official blog post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-wing-social-networks-don-t-work?ref=404media.co" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garbage Day</a> and reported on by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">404 Media</a>, Niantic revealed that it's building something called a "Large Geospatial Model." You may already know what a "Large Language Model" is - it's Chat GPT. It's an AI that is trained on enormous amounts of existing text so that it can then produce text on its own that sounds normal, and conceivably like what a user might want to hear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Large Geospatial Model is essentially the same idea, but applied to the physical world. It's trained on what real-world places look like (a church, a park, a house, etc), and then it can use that data to produce information on what actual places it hasn't seen yet might look like. Niantic claimed this will be useful for technology such as AR glasses, robotics, content creation, and other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or as Niantic put it:</p><blockquote>Imagine yourself standing behind a church. Let us assume the closest local model has seen only the front entrance of that church, and thus, it will not be able to tell you where you are. The model has never seen the back of that building. But on a global scale, we have seen a lot of churches, thousands of them, all captured by their respective local models at other places worldwide. No church is the same, but many share common characteristics. An LGM [Large Geospatial Model] is a way to access that distributed knowledge.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But to make this work, Niantic needs lots of data to train that AI on, and it can only do so much on its own. Google's been collecting location data for years via Google Maps and those funny cars it uses to get street view info, but that's not sufficient in this case. Cars can only drive on roads, and Niantic needs pedestrian information from places cars can't go. Fortunately, Niantic has thousands of people globally pointing their phones at things and sending that information back via its various projects and apps, Pokémon Go included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Niantic said in its post that it's been building something called a Visual Positioning System (VPS), a technology that uses an image from a phone to determine the position and orientation of a location on a 3D map. The technology is supposed to allow users to position themselves in the world with "centimeter-level accuracy," which allows them to then see digital content overlayed on the physical world "precisely and realistically." Again, from Niantic:</p><blockquote>This content is persistent in that it stays in a location after you’ve left, and it’s then shareable with others. For example, we recently started rolling out an experimental feature in Pokémon GO, called Pokémon Playgrounds, where the user can place Pokémon at a specific location, and they will remain there for others to see and interact with.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But all of this technology exists because users are constantly scanning the world with their phones while using Niantic's apps, including Pokémon Go, and have been for years now. Niantic said it currently has 10 million scanned locations around the world, one million usable with its VPS service, and gets one million new scans every single week containing hundreds of discrete images. That's a lot of data.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Niantic said it's using the data explicitly to develop its own technologies that it then turns around and implements into its existing products. However, in recent years there have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/27/23808499/ai-openai-google-meta-data-privacy-nope" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous concerns</a> over how companies collect data, use it to train AI, and what those AI models might eventually be used for. While today Niantic's LGM work may just be limited to letting us drop cute Pokémon models in the world for other people to find, tomorrow its uses may grow increasingly complex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Niantic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Activision has revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players can get a nice bonus in Call of Duty: Warzone.

GameSpot understands that people who play through Game Pass can also get the XP boost.</p><p>The fine print in the trailer specifies that the 30% XP boost is only available during the seasonal content for Black Ops 6, which suggests it'll end in time for 2025's inevitable Call of Duty game.

		<p>Microsoft has announced that you can now stream your own games with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-cloud-gaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, a feature bundled in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>. Well, you can stream some of them, with the company limiting this to just 50 games to start with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stream Your Own Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/79Rza5taYAM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s a pretty limited opening salvo, though makes sense for Microsoft to gradually ramp the selection up – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/04/xbox-game-pass-xcloud-streaming-15-september-dualshock-4/">echoes of the original cloud gaming launch</a> – instead of trying to cover thousands of Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S games from the off. Of course, since you need to have a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, this is in addition to all of the streamable games included within that (whether you own them outright or not).</p>
<p>Own game streaming is included in <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/regions">all 28 countries</a> where Xbox Cloud Gaming is available, and is supported via TVs and browsers on smartphone, tablets and PC – note that the Xbox Game Pass app recently lost the ability to stream on Android, and never had it on iOS. Microsoft is working to build it into the Xbox app for Windows and on Xbox consoles in 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/">Head to the Xbox site for compatible device guidelines and how to get started</a>.</p>

<p>Notable games that are included in this launch list are Baldur’s Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. They’re all games that are unlikely to feature in Game Pass for the foreseeable future, and so are great ones to include here.</p>
<p>The 50 games available today are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Animal Well</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</li>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Baldur’s Gate 3</li>
<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</li>
<li>The Casting of Frank Stone</li>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
<li>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</li>
<li>Dredge</li>
<li>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</li>
<li>Farming Simulator 25</li>
<li>Fear the Spotlight</li>
<li>Final Fantasy XIV Online</li>
<li>Final Fantasy</li>
<li>Final Fantasy II</li>
<li>Final Fantasy III</li>
<li>Final Fantasy IV</li>

<li>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</li>
<li>Lego Harry Potter Collection</li>
<li>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</li>
<li>Metro Exodus</li>
<li>Mortal Kombat 1</li>

<li>7 Days to Die</li>
<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>
<li>Stray</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The Outlast Trials</li>
<li>The Plucky Squire</li>
<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li>
<li>Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</li>
<li>TopSpin 2K25</li>
<li>Undertale</li>
<li>Visions of Mana</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li>
<li>WWE 2K24</li>
</ol>
<p>When it was still known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-xcloud">Project xCloud</a> in 2019, Microsoft confirmed their intention to let users start streaming their purchased games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-50-games-dualshock-4-pc-coming-to-japan-canada-india-europe-2020/">in 2020</a>. While Xbox Cloud Gaming itself launched in 2020, purchased streaming was pushed back to 2022… but never materialised. Cloud Gaming has always been restricted to games in the Xbox Game Pass library, and even then isn’t necessarily universal. It’s great to finally have this feature added, even if it is rather limited.</p>

			<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> that Xbox Cloud Gaming would be updated to support the long-awaited feature to allow users to stream their own games. Today, that feature has gone live with that name: Stream Your Own Game. Of course, you'll need an active Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The feature is currently available on Samsung Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, Meta Quest headsets, and (via browser) on PCs, smartphones, and tablets. You can read more about compatibility on the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/set-up-smart-tv-xbox-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support page</a>. Stream Your Own Game will launch next year for Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on PC, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301435/final-fantasy-14-mobile-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you heard that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877031/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-square-enix-pc">critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a> is getting a mobile version? In a video announcement, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> game director Naoki Yoshida announced <em>FFXIV Mobile</em>, a joint production between Square Enix and Tencent’s Lightspeed Studios<em>. </em>The announcement was accompanied by a teaser trailer showing Warriors of Light in locations all across the game’s world of Eorzea. </p><p>It seems as though <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> will be a reset of sorts for the MMORPG, featuring content from the base game without anything from its five expansions. In the video, Yoshida said that Lightspeed Studios was working to, “faithfully recreate the story, duties, battle content, and other aspects of the original game.” Lightspeed Studios, known for<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17128526/pubg-mobile-hands-on-review-vs-xbox-fortnite"><em>PUBG Mobile</em></a>, is a subsidiary of Tencent which has had success adapting a number of mobile games from other companies’ IP including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294524/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-game"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon</em></a>, and<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>.</p><p>The teaser trailer didn’t exactly show what <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> combat would look like. But judging from the little bit of battle it did show, it seems like Square Enix might be aiming to make a <em>FFXIV</em> version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/18/16979602/final-fantasy-xv-pocket-edition-ios-android"><em>Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition</em></a> — a stripped down mobile version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/28/13757150/final-fantasy-15-review-ps4-xbox-one">2016 RPG</a> with simplified combat controls and chibi-fied character art. <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931"><em>FFXIV Mobile</em>’s website boasts</a> that players will have access to nine job classes (the full-version of the game has 21) that they’ll be able to switch classes with a single tap rather than requiring players to dig into their inventory and equip a job stone.</p><p>Neither Yoshida’s video nor the website went into detail about how much the game will cost and what, if any, traditional mobile game elements will make it in. However, according to a report in Japanese gaming magazine <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23633"><em>Famitsu</em></a>, <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> will be free-to-play but will not contain any gacha elements. This potentially means the game will have to incorporate monetization some other way and if Square Enix knows anything at all about its player base, then expect to pay for mounts and, critically, player costumes. After all, glamour is the true endgame.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But after all these years, the timing of the award show confounds me, especially as I see it unintentionally sabotage games that are eligible for nomination, but release too close to the cut-off date to get a proper shot at consideration.

According to staffers at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thegameawards.com/voting-jury&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thegameawards.com/voting-jury" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jury outlets</a></span> <em>Kotaku </em>has spoken to, ballots were due on November 12. While each outlet has its own internal processes for how it handles submitting nominations, some that <em>Kotaku</em> spoke to explained they had to have votes in at an even earlier date so they could tally those votes for submission. The result is several overlapping deadlines that affect which games actually have a reasonable chance of being nominated for The Game Awards. A game like <em>The Veilguard</em>, which can take up to 60 hours to complete and launched less than two weeks before ballots were due, is affected more by timing than any other factor. Voters didn’t have as much time to play it as they did similarly epic games like <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> which launched much earlier, nor does it benefit from brevity the way some games do, like <em>Astro Bot</em>.</p><p>Because of the lack of distance between the eligibility cut-off and votes being due, timing is everything in determining whether or not some games even get on the ballot. Oftentimes, the Game Awards are less a celebration of the best and brightest the industry has to offer than they are a representation of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/game-awards-2024-nominations-snubs-surprises/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/game-awards-2024-nominations-snubs-surprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular and mainstream games that voters actually got around to</a></span>. Games that aren’t even out yet are technically eligible, but it’s unlikely that many voters will have had much time with these, if any. Sure, someone might have a review copy, but one or two people at a publication trying to convince their colleagues who haven’t touched a game that they should give it a space on their single ballot to the biggest award show in the industry is a near-impossible task. The lack of a meaningful gap between the eligibility cut-off and when ballots are due is especially damaging to games that technically fall within the window but are only available to a select few jurors, and only for a brief time before their votes must be cast.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-recommend-id="image://e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Game Awards</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-recommend-id="image://e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For example, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 </em>launched today, November 20, and while I don’t think it would have been nominated for much, under The Game Awards’ current structure, it was technically eligible. But a game that only a select few of the jury has been able to put reasonable time into will never have a fair shot because statistically, almost no one on the jury would have been able to play it. As long as the show’s eligibility window ends within a hair’s breadth of when the ballots are due, games that launch close to the show itself are sprinting after competition that’s had a months-long head start. Sometimes a game like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a></span><em> </em>manages to make its way into multiple categories despite releasing late in the window because it’s a huge, first-party IP that you can complete in a comfortable 20 hours. Other games end up like <em>The Veilguard</em>,<em> </em>launching at a time so disadvantageous that you only get one nomination in Accessibility, chosen by a specialist panel whose role in the awards is to be tuned into that pillar of game design.<br></p><p>Compare this to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.recordingacademy.com/news/2025-grammys-online-entry-process-how-to-guide-now-open&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.recordingacademy.com/news/2025-grammys-online-entry-process-how-to-guide-now-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Grammys</a></span>, one of the biggest awards ceremonies in the music industry. This next one is set to take place on February 2, but the eligibility criteria is months removed from the actual show. The 2025 Grammys will recognize music released from September 16, 2023 to August 30, 2024. Nominations weren’t even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.grammy.com/news/2025-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2025-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced until November 8</a></span>. Look at all that time and space to actually consider what should be nominated. I’m not going to go to bat for The Grammys’ actual nominations because that show has its own institutional problems and a very narrow view of what’s worth recognizing. However, the structure of its eligibility and nomination process sure does sound like it would solve some of The Game Awards’ problems.</p><p>A lot of other video game award shows, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2024/06/20/2025-bafta-games-awards-opens-for-entries-with-new-fairer-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2024/06/20/2025-bafta-games-awards-opens-for-entries-with-new-fairer-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like the BAFTA Games Awards</a></span>, also don’t do this, and instead put months of distance between the window of eligibility and the date of the actual show. So why does The Game Awards do things this way? We reached out to the show for comment and didn’t receive an answer in time for publication, but I would hypothesize that much of it boils down to the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267">feeling like an ad for games</a></span> rather than a celebration of them. December is a strategic time for publishers to want their games to be adorned with accolades as people are looking to make their Christmas lists. I have to wonder if The Game Awards is even capable of this kind of restructuring, given how embedded it is in the industry’s marketing cycle. But if the show even considered how its structure inevitably undermines games like <em>The Veilguard</em>, it might make for a better, more representative event.</p><p>Inevitably, there will be those who say <em>The Veilguard </em>wasn’t snubbed and that it just didn’t deserve recognition. Pushing aside the bad-faith transphobic and racist nonsense that’s been surrounding the games for months, there’s a discussion to be had there. It is, without a doubt, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">one of the more divisive games</a></span> in BioWare’s catalog. But anyone who thinks its timing didn’t play a factor in its complete absence is kidding themselves, and this kind of fundamental failing will affect games you like just as much as ones you don’t one day. Justice for Gareth David-Lloyd, you deserved a Best Performance nod for your work as Solas.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream 50 games that they already own, including <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, a variety of <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p><p>The expansion to 50 more games is just the beginning of opening up the Xbox game library to cloud streaming. “Our library of cloud-playable titles will continue to grow, as we work with our partners around the world to bring you a diverse and expansive selection of great games across devices,” says Ashley McKissick, corporate vice president of Xbox Experiences and platforms engineering.</p><p>The 50 additional games will be available through TVs, smartphones, tablets, and PCs through a web browser. Microsoft is also planning to bring Xbox library streaming to Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on Windows next year.</p><p>This expansion is part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">I revealed last month</a> that Microsoft was planning to start letting Xbox Insiders get access to more games on Xbox Cloud Gaming in November, and these initial 50 games are the start of eventually expanding this to thousands of Xbox games to cover entire libraries.</p><p>The original Project xCloud was&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/14/expanding-project-xcloud-more-games-more-ways-to-play/">supposed to launch</a>&nbsp;with game library streaming in 2020, but it never did, and Microsoft then announced it would support game libraries on Xbox Cloud Gaming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159492/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-library-owned-games-feature">in 2022</a>. That never happened either, and I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">reported last month</a> that the work to make this a reality has been complicated. Microsoft has to ready thousands of games on its custom Xbox cloud servers while balancing save files, game updates, and much more. </p><p>While thousands of games will eventually be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I’m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p><p>Microsoft was also planning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app</a> for Android in the US in November, thanks to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">court ruling</a>&nbsp;last month that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store. Google won a temporary administrative stay on this ruling late last month, so it’s no longer clear when Microsoft will be able to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app on Android.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a> is one of the games I think of when I recall the golden days of video game expos, before Covid rolled up and nuked the business model. It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.</p>
<p>Most rounds of Gang Beasts go like this: an absolutely brainless opening scrum before the participants peel off into separate duels. At least one person will throw themselves off a ledge whilst trying to throw somebody else. People will struggle to see what they're doing because they're sobbing with laughter. And then, the finale: two or more players dangling from a precipice, grimly refusing to let go of each other, until somebody manages to headbutt the player holding onto the building.</p>
<p>I love Gang Beasts. I loved it at expos and I love playing it at home with my family. So I'm tickled punk to learn that the Steam version has received a chonky new update, adding a driveable construction crane level and flocks of vicious, cuddly birds. Here's a trailer.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwDIDelKZ6Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/285900/view/4482865501645570061?l=english">As detailed in the announcement blog</a>, Update 1.25 adds a new Crane level that "includes the first implementation of our new driveables system, with players being able to jump into the Crane cockpit to take the controls." Weaponising construction equipment? How very Gang Beasts. But watch out, because Crane also harbours some new and angry wildlife. Survive for long enough, and avian hoodlums will swoop down, seize you in their talons and try to fly off with you. The obvious question: if all the players link arms, can the birds pick up everybody at once?</p><p>The update also adds a few bird-themed costumes - unfortunately, it doesn't look like they give you the power of flight. This is the first proper Gang Beasts update in years, I think, though there have been smaller patches for bugs and whatnot. Are you still playing? In the course of writing this up, I've learned that there might genuinely be some kind of serious Gang Beasts competitive scene. Leave it to gamers to ruin the fun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

By Niantic's admission, its VPS has over 10 million locations scanned globally from the past five years, and "receive[s] about 1 million fresh scans each week," which are collected from its games—one of which has been quite popular for nearly a decade, meaning players may have unknowingly participated in helping build its LGM.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar to a Large Language Model (LLM), Niantic's model scrapes data from real-world locations, and it hopes to use the technology to "enable computers not only to perceive and understand physical spaces, but also to interact with them in new ways." And what makes its data more substantial than something like Google Maps or Street is the point of view: as Niantic notes, the data is "taken from a pedestrian perspective and includes places inaccessible to cars."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of July 15, 2024, Niantic's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy">privacy policy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> confirms it uses geospatial technology and player recordings to "build a 3D understanding of real-world places, with the goal of offering new types of AR experiences to our users."
