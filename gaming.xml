            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>At last, after assuring fan's that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>'s free DLC would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-is-still-coming-this-month-so-dont-worry">out "around Christmas"</a>, Level-5 has delivered the goods right on time.</p>
<p>Version 2.0.0 is <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/2003806280893567182">available to download now</a> on Switch 1 &amp; 2 and it includes <strong>The Sinister Broker Bazario’s Schemes</strong>, an open-world roguelike DLC expansion that adds a new area to the game, Snoozaland. This is available from Chapter 3 onwards in-game.</p>
<p>The patch goes way beyond just a whole boatload of playable content, though. There are five new mounts, new items, weapons, and customisation options, a higher damage cap, an increase in the number of houses you can build at your home base, and the ability to polish tools made by a Blacksmith, Carpenter, and Alchemist.</p>
<p>If you want all of the granulars, then here are the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_2_0_0/">full patch notes from Level-5</a>:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> may have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-all-the-sins-we-bear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released five and a half years ago</a>, but gamers are still discovering new things about it. <a href="https://x.com/Speclizer_/status/2003541114201002410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to modder Speclizer</a>, <strong>Naughty Dog</strong> had implemented a <strong>'Hold Up'</strong> feature that was cut from the final game. This allowed Ellie to sneak up behind an enemy, force them to put their hands up, and subsequently control where they would move next and also whether to face toward Ellie or away from her. Eventually, they would try to pull out their weapon in an attempt to fight back.</p>



<p>Since Naughty Dog left this unused animation and script in the game, Speclizer is now looking to add it back to The Last of Us Part II, although it will apparently require 'quite a bit of work'. Of course, this would only be available for the PC version, since the PlayStation 5 version is not moddable. This feature may<span> only be initially available to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/Speclizer" target="_blank">Speclizer's Patreon</a>&nbsp;backers</span>. The modder offers access to all tools and mods with the Tier 2 subscription, which costs €12,50 per month. Speclizer previously released the Project FEDRA and Endure Survival game modes for The Last of Us Part I.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Project FEDRA is a new gameplay experience where the playable character is a FEDRA soldier tasked with maintaining order and completing critical missions, which reward players with ration cards, the currency of the Quarantine Zone. The cards can then be used to purchase weapons and gear to aid in future missions. Speclizer has plans to port it to The Last of Us Part II as well.</p>



<p>Endure Survival, on the other hand, is a more classic wave-based Horde mode with a shop system (players can buy gear between rounds at Bill's store).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, series creator Neil Druckmann led fans to believe that The Last of Us Part II might very well be the last game in the franchise, later adding that the situation could only change if he and Naughty Dog can come up with a new story worth telling. However, three months ago, Druckmann teased 'various The Last of Us' things he is working on after stepping back from his role in the HBO TV adaptation, heavily suggesting a new game is indeed in the works. First, though, the studio based in Santa Monica, California, has to complete its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't launch before 2027</a>. This means fans of the post-apocalyptic franchise may have to wait several more years before returning to the world infected with the mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>2025 was the year generative AI made its presence felt in the video game industry. Its use has been discovered in some of the most popular games of the year, and CEOs from some of the largest game studios claim it’s being implemented everywhere in the industry including in their own development processes. Meanwhile, rank-and-file developers, especially in the indie games space, are pushing back against its encroachment, coming up with ways to signal their games are gen-AI free.</p><p>Generative AI has largely replaced NFTs as the buzzy trend publishers are chasing. Its proponents claim that the technology will be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694531/runway-ai-video-games-generate">great democratization force</a> in video game development, as gen AI’s ability to amalgamate images, text, audio, and video could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878504/the-elder-scrolls-6-2026-release-xbox-exclusive">shorten development times</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24009903/the-cost-of-aaa-development-is-too-damn-high">shrink budgets</a> — ameliorating two major problems plaguing the industry right now. In service to that idea, numerous video game studios have announced partnerships with gen-AI companies.</p><div><p>Ubisoft has technology <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7Cm07zbBGy4Xml6WgYi25d/the-convergence-of-ai-and-creativity-introducing-ghostwriter">that can generate short snippets of dialogue</a> called barks and has gen-AI powered NPCs that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105748/nvidia-neo-npc-prototypes-gdc-2024">players can have conversations with</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools">EA has partnered with Stability AI</a>, Microsoft is using AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">to analyze and generate gameplay</a>. Outside of official partnerships, major game companies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-ai-voices-the-finals-embark-studios/">Nexon</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">Krafton</a>, and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">Square Enix</a> are vocally embracing gen AI.</p></div><div><p>As a result, gen AI is starting to show up in games in a big way. Up until this point, gen AI in gaming had been mostly relegated to fringe cases — either <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/757816/hidden-door-early-access-ai-story">prototypes</a> or <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/the-deflating-realization-that-a-neat-little-game-was-ai-all-along/">small, low-quality games</a> that generally get lost in the tens of thousands of titles <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">released on Steam each year</a>. But now, gen AI is cropping up in the year’s biggest releases. <em>ARC Raiders</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198">one of the breakout multiplayer shooter hits of the year</a>, used gen AI for character dialogue. <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-responds-to-complaints-of-ai-generated-assets-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">used gen-AI images</a>. Even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843340/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-game-of-the-year">2025’s TGA Game of the Year,</a> <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, </em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-ai-use-resurfaces-amid-backlash-against-larian-divinity-lead-says-we-have-good-qa-and-leads-to-fans-questioning-if-the-rpg-will-accidentally-ship-with-ai-assets/">featured gen-AI images</a> <a href="https://x.com/nyanomancer/status/1917435885429150176?s=20">before they were quietly removed</a>.</p></div><p>Reaction to this encroachment from both players and developers has been mixed. It seems like generally, players don’t like gen AI showing up in games. When gen-AI assets were discovered in <em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em>, the game’s developer Ubisoft claimed the assets “<a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">slipped through</a>” review and they were subsequently replaced. When gen-AI assets were found in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, however, Activision acknowledged the issue, but kept the images in the game. Critical response has also been lopsided. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><em>ARC Raiders</em> was awarded low scores</a> with reviewers specifically citing the use of gen AI as the reason. <em>Clair Obscur</em>, though, was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/12/19/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-another-game-of-the-year-at-the-indie-game">nigh universally praised</a> and its use of gen AI, however temporary, has barely been mentioned.</p><p>It seems like developers are sensitive to the public’s distaste for gen AI but are unwilling to commit to not using it. After gen-AI assets were discovered in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, Activision said it uses the tech <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/">to “empower” its developers, not replace them</a>. When asked about gen AI showing up in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, EA VP Rebecka Coutaz called the technology seductive but affirmed <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">it wouldn’t appear in the final product</a>. Swen Vincke, CEO of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">said gen AI is being used for the studio’s next game <em>Divinity</em></a> but only for generating concepts and ideas. Everything in the finished game, he claimed, would be made by humans. He also hinted at why game makers insist on using the tech despite the backlash developers usually receive whenever it’s found.</p><div><p>“This is a tech-driven industry, so you try stuff,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ma5dqbmgm22o">he told <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Jason Schreier in an interview</a>. “You can’t afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you’re not using it, you’re dead.”</p></div><div><p>Comments from other CEOs reinforce Vincke’s point. Junghun Lee, the CEO of <em>ARC Raider</em>s’ parent company Nexon, said in an interview that, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">“It’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.”</a></p></div><p>The problem is, though, gen AI doesn’t yet seem to be the golden egg its supporters want people to believe it is. Last year, Keywords Studios, a game development services company, published a report on creating a 2D video game using only gen-AI tools. The company claimed that gen-AI tools can streamline some development processes but ultimately <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/keywords-tried-to-make-a-game-using-genai-but-said-the-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent-#close-modal">cannot replace the work of human talent</a>. Discovering gen AI in <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Pax Romana</em> was possible precisely because of the low-quality of the images that were found. With Ubisoft’s interactive gen-AI NPCs, the dialogue they spout sounds unnatural and stilted. Players in the 2025 Chinese martial arts MMORPG <em>Where Winds Meet</em> are manipulating its AI chatbot NPCs <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/where-winds-meet-players-find-a-way-to-skip-side-quests-by-manipulating-the-mmos-ai-chatbot-npcs-into-just-giving-over-the-goods-instead/">to break the game</a>, just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice"><em>Fortnite </em>players were able to make AI-powered Darth Vader swear</a>.</p><p>For all the promises of gen AI, its current results do not live up to expectations. So why is it everywhere?</p><p>One reason is the competitive edge AI might but currently can’t provide that Swen Vincke alluded to in his interview with <em>Bloomberg</em>. Another reason is also the simplest: it’s the economy, stupid. Despite inflation, flagging consumer confidence and spending, and rising unemployment, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/business/the-ai-boom-economy.html">the stock market is still booming</a>, propped up by the billions and billions of dollars being poured into AI tech. Game makers in search of capital to keep business and profits going want in on that. Announcing AI initiatives and touting the use of AI tools — even if those tools have a relatively minor impact on the final product — can be a way to signal to AI-eager investors that a game company is worth their money.</p><p>That might explain why the majority of gen-AI’s supporters in gaming come from the C-suite of AAA studios and not smaller indie outfits who almost universally revile the tech. Indies face <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/did-video-game-investment-hit-rock-bottom-and-is-it-ready-to-go-back-up">the same economic pressure</a> as bigger studios but have far fewer resources to navigate those pressures. Ostensibly, indie developers are the ones who stand to benefit the most from the tech but, so far, are its biggest opponents. They are pushing back against the assertion that gen AI is everywhere, being used by everybody, with some marking their games with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders">anti-AI logos</a> proclaiming their games were made wholly by humans.</p><p>For some indie developers, using gen AI defeats the purpose of game making entirely. The challenge of coming up with ideas and solutions to development problems — the things gen AI is supposed to automate — is a big part of game making’s appeal to them. There are also moral and environmental implications indie developers seem especially sensitive to. Gen-AI outputs are cobbled from existing bodies of work that were often used without consent or compensation.

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Horror Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/24/game-of-the-year-2025-best-horror-game/</link>
            <guid>1391563</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 was another great year for fans of things that go bump in the night, and so it’s fitting that we visit these nightmarish visions of gaming <em>just </em>before Christmas.</p>
<p>Whilst much of the attention was focused on titles from some of the industry’s biggest names, it was another year with almost countless indie games that deserve more eyes and attention – although given that so many were released over the Halloween period I’m still working my way through them now. Our top three offers a glimpse of the range of experiences that are grouped together under the term of ‘horror’, starting with our thoroughly deserving winner.</p>



<p>After years of disappointment and unremarkable spinoffs Silent Hill came back with a bang with Bloober Team’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">remake of Silent Hill 2</a> last year. The increased focus on the series meant that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/">Silent Hill f</a> had far more attention and anticipation than would have been the case only a short while ago. Fortunately the game is fantastic and offers a whole new spin on the horrors of gaming’s foggiest of locations. While there was some controversy over the switch to Japan rather than the iconic town of Silent Hill itself, the narrative and complex puzzles quickly won players over.</p>
<p>Set in 1960s Japan, in the fiction town of Ebisugaoka, you play as Hinako Shimizu, a high school student who finds herself trapped within a sinister fog (of course) and who must fight off terrifying monsters in order to find her missing friends. Alongside the shift in period and setting, Silent Hill f offers a far more involved combat system that owes a debt to Soulslikes. This debt is also shared with the drip-drop of lore, encouraging you to investigate every corner to find more information. Some puzzles absolutely require you to have found the right clues, so searching is essential.</p>

<p>The horrific beauty of the design, the complex unfolding of the story over multiple playthroughs, and the terrifying atmosphere make this a worthy winner of this year’s award.</p>
<h3>Cronos: The New Dawn – Runner Up</h3>
<p>After the aforementioned Silent Hill 2 Remake, many previous critics of Bloober Team found themselves changing their views, and so Cronos: The New Dawn had a larger and more attentive audience than it might have had otherwise. Luckily the game was a fantastic fusion of Silent Hill and Dead Space that had enough ideas of its own to become a survival horror standout. The Silent Hill influences come from the dual environments – switching in time between a Polish town prior to and immediately following a mysterious event that saw the populace transformed into monsters. As for the Dead Space inspirations, the impactful combat here felt highly reminiscent of Isaac Clarke at his most brutal.</p>
<p>The familiarity of the mechanics were combined with a fascinating science fiction survival horror narrative that saw you play as The Traveller, a helmeted stranger sent through time to retrieve the memories of key figures who could explain what had happened in the past. This time travelling mechanic led to complex narrative transitions and also gave everything an uncanny veneer of past, present, and future. While puzzles were mostly more simple than classic Silent Hill brainteasers, the excellent presentation and voice acting pushed players through to a satisfying (albeit ambiguous) conclusion. And I haven’t even mentioned that you get to rescue cats as you go!</p>
<h3>Navicula Meatus – Runner Up</h3>
<p>While both the previous games share a familiar DNA from classic survival horror (although both bring interesting new perspectives) Navicula Meatus is an indie game in the truest sense. The horror of this world is the horror of feeling completely out of place in a strange land. There is no interpretable language in Navicula Meatus – everything instead being portrayed through an impenetrable typescript and pictograms. Even working out how to get started is deliberately obscure as the main menu similarly has no words to guide you.</p>
<p>Once you do get into the game you are confronted by a lo-fi aesthetic that looks like a mixture of classic Doom and dungeon crawler titles like Eye of the Beholder, and plays like it too, thanks to the minimalist keyboard-based controls for movement. This simplistic set of mechanics feels familiar and yet nothing else about Navicula Meatus is. You are a meaty bipedal crab of some description and must trade mysterious items with a host of similarly surreal and monstrous characters. Once this opening section is completed then things (somehow) get even more strange.</p>
<p>While a very different style and vibe to this year’s other top horror games, Navicula Meatus is a truly unique experience that deserves a far wider audience. It is one of those games that you will either bounce off or become obsessed with, but give it a try and you might just find your new favourite indie horror.</p>
<p><strong>Horrible Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Echoes of the Living</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flesh Made Fear</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tormented Souls 2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After that thoroughly spookifying entry in our GOTY awards, we’ll take a little breather for Christmas and then return for the final sprint through to the top award at the end of the year!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: The Rogue Prince Of Persia (Switch 2) - A Worthy, Approachable Follow-Up To Dead Cells]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-rogue-prince-of-persia</link>
            <guid>1391560</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161307/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s hard to believe that it’s already been the better part of a decade since the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a>, though its absurdly long stretch of post-launch DLC expansions and updates certainly helped to keep it in the average player’s consciousness. The original Dead Cells developer, Motion Twin, actually passed the buck in 2019 to a sort-of assist studio (Evil Empire) formed of former Motion Twin devs and new hires, which made the lion’s share of DLC updates, including the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dead_cells_return_to_castlevania">Return to Castlevania</a>. After Dead Cells was officially sunsetted, Evil Empire wasn’t <em>quite</em> done with some of its gameplay ideas, and built this roguelite entry in Ubisoft's franchise.</p>
<p>Billed as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, this acts as a sort of spiritual successor to Dead Cells, carrying on many gameplay concepts while integrating some new ideas that help to build its own identity. I’m happy to report that Evil Empire clearly hasn’t lost a step in the transition to a new project - The Rogue Prince of Persia is an approachable and addictive take on the studio’s signature action gameplay and is absolutely something I’d suggest you check out soon.</p>
<figure><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161304/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a bit of a deviation from the typical roguelite format, the story here actually features as more than just mere window dressing to get you into the action. You play as the titular Prince, a smooth and competent fighter whose confidence is inflated by a magic bola he’s had since childhood which instantly sends him back in time whenever he falls in battle.</p>
<p>The Prince is tasked with leading the defence effort to save his beloved city of Tisfun from an invasion by dark magic-powered Huns, yet after a brave but ultimately doomed initial effort, the Prince is revived by a mysterious shaman in a camp outside the city, from which he launches his endless attempts to defeat the Hun generals and save his people.</p>
<p>A key part of how the narrative unfolds is linked to the Mindmap, a sort of constellation that tracks major events, characters, and key items to help facilitate the locations you pick for runs. As you move through an area, you’ll often come across a character or environmental object with information that moves the story forward a bit, whether by unlocking a new area to explore in a subsequent run or giving you a hint to solve a puzzle.</p>
<figure><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161308/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are many instances where progressing the story in one area first requires you to come back in a later run after exploring another area to get a key item or solution, incentivising replays while also keeping the Prince’s story moving. I thought this was a very interesting way of mixing storytelling with gameplay, as it makes each death and subsequent restart feel like a <em>continuation</em> rather than a setback.</p>
<p>Evil Empire's past experience with Dead Cells is immediately apparent in the gameplay, which is equal parts snappy, thrilling, and difficult. You begin each run with a weapon and a limited-use secondary tool, giving you enough options in combat to feel like you have a fighting chance, but not enough to get complacent. The Prince is a slippery and lithe combatant, effortlessly gliding across walls, jumping between beams, and vaulting over enemies as he cuts them to ribbons with his blades and tools. His agility is all the more important given that he’s quite ‘squishy’ if a foe happens to land a blow — the Prince may be able to dish out the pain, but it doesn’t take too many hits from even trash mob enemies to put him in the danger zone, if not sending him all the way back to camp.</p>
<figure><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161310/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of what makes the combat so engaging is the sheer variety of weapons and enemy types, making encounters feel dynamic and fresh. Every weapon has a different feel and caters to a different playstyle, with each featuring unique special attacks and different conditions to trigger critical hits. Pair this with enemies that have clearly telegraphed (but tightly timed) tells and combat quickly becomes a deadly dance of weaving between danger zones, prioritising targets, and carefully managing your own movements to maximise the pain you can deliver. Skirmishes rarely last more than a couple of seconds, but each one feels invigorating, especially once you’ve gotten yourself into a nice rhythm and have mastered the attack animations of that area’s enemies.</p>
<p>This sense of free-flowing progression extends to the platforming, which manages to be challenging without being too punishing. As long as there’s a wall in the background, the Prince can get a couple of steps in on a wall run to help bridge the gaps between poles and ledges, which adds an interesting dimension where you constantly have to pay just as much attention to the background as you do the ground beneath his feet.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of a learning curve to the controls, but it doesn’t take too long before you’re able to effectively read the upcoming terrain and parkour through it with ease, calling to mind some Sonic games in how it rewards dexterity with speed. There’s even an in-game mechanic for this called Vayu’s Breath, which increases speed and grants other passive benefits if you can time various jumps perfectly.</p>
<figure><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161300/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All this comes together to make for a game that <em>moves</em> in a way that few other entries in the genre manage to capture. Defeating enemies, scaling obstructions, swiping rewards, and lunging between ledges leads to a wonderfully cohesive experience where it feels almost like you’re being pulled forward by an invisible force to the next objective. That polished moment-to-moment gameplay then helps to take the bite out of the inevitable deaths that you face — even if you have to reset, the game feels so good to play that you can’t help but rush right into your next run.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty, there are a variety of metaprogression elements that offer both vertical and horizontal progress to take the edge off. In terms of vertical progression, every enemy and boss you kill earns you some experience, which grants you a skill point each time you level up to be invested in a collection of skill trees you slowly unlock. These can grant you flat stat increases like more max health or a higher health potion carrying capacity, or more passive buffs like the ability to break shields with a kick. As for horizontal progression, the soul cinders you slowly accrue throughout a run can be spent on new weapons, medallions, and tools that are all added to the loot pool for enhanced build variety in subsequent runs.</p>
<figure><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161299/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Between these things, it always feels like you’re making <em>some</em> sort of progress with each run, regardless of how far you actually got, which goes a long way towards making the gameplay loop so addictive. Not only do you feel a little more powerful, but there are very often rewards back at camp that are just out of reach and require you to do another run for resources needed to unlock another weapon or skill.</p>
<p>So great are these rewards that they can sometimes go a bit too far, making the game a little <em>too</em> easy in places. It should only take you about 10 hours to reach the initial ending, less if you’re experienced with games like this and pick up on the mechanics quickly. And while there’s a nicely rewarding take on the Heat System from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> here to turn up the pain on subsequent attempts as you go for the true ending, I still couldn’t help but feel like some of my victories came a little too easily. Suffice to say, those of you hoping for something as tough as Dead Cells may be left a bit disappointed, as you’ll likely chew through all the content in this release faster than you’d initially think.</p>

<p>Visually, the Rogue Prince of Persia looks fantastic, with a somewhat comic book art style that focuses on various distinguishing colour palettes and set pieces for each biome. Whether you’re slipping down the cool waterways of the Ruined Aqueduct or dodging between sawblades and flames in the warm halls of the Grand Academy, each area is memorable and distinct from the next. The action also unfolds at what appears to be a smooth 60fps in both docked and handheld, with the resolution looking crisp in both modes, as well.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia stands as both an excellent and innovative entry in the long-running series and a worthy follow-up to the developer’s previous work. The smooth action, gorgeous visuals, and addictive loop all come together to make for the kind of game that’s tough to put down.</p>
<p>Though skilled players may be a bit put off by the easier difficulty relative to roguelite genre standards, this is still a very easy recommendation for anyone interested in a more approachable roguelite that doesn’t have a massive learning curve. Evil Empire has done a great job in crafting an impressive, approachable action game here.</p></section>

So far, AI hasn't made processes more efficient.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Vincke further clarified on X (formerly Twitter)</a> about his stance. "We’re not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," he wrote. "I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that."</p><p>Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">followed up</a>, asserting that not exploring new technologies would be "irresponsible." If it yields bad results or misaligns with their values, they "will make changes."</p><p>Chmielarz doesn't condemn this exploratory use of AI, but he recognizes that some would dislike it, especially how AI could be "spoiling" the project from the start. Even if the final product is human made, it's starting from a sort of "rotten seed."</p><p>Of course, this doesn't account for other major arguments against AI, including its environmental impact and plagiarism accusations, among other things.</p><p>"[Larian] got a little bit unlucky. I think that Larian is definitely not evil," Chmielarz said. "I'm seeing from what they wrote [on Dec 18] that they're... doing deep soul searching of what exactly is that going to mean for Larian going forward, and so we'll see what happens."</p><p>In an email follow-up, I asked if humans fully made a game but had some inspiration from AI-generated art, could it be considered free of AI. His answer was yes, particularly because the hypothetical humans are behind the creativity and generation, not AI.</p><p>"Today, I don’t think it’s a real problem anyway, as game concept art generated by AI is much worse than people think," he added. "But assuming that one day it becomes excellent, then it’s up to a studio to decide how much AI they want to invite into their development process. With <em>Witchfire</em>, that door is firmly closed. We started the game before AI was even a thing, and we’ll finish it without a single element being created by AI."</p><figure role="group">

<h2>How the Astronauts Are NOT Using AI in <em>Witchfire</em></h2><p>Chmielarz has spent most of the past decade working on <em>Witchfire</em>, a first-person shooter that mashes together elements from soulslikes, roguelikes, extraction shooters, and heist games.</p><p>When it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tga-2017-witchfire-announced" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">first revealed in 2017</a>, AI was but a twinkle in some Silicon Valley tech bros' eyes. When it released in early access in 2023, ChatGPT debuted the year before. Now in 2025, AI is pushed to the top of every Google search.</p><blockquote><p>"We said to ourselves, let's be very simple about this, and we're just disallowing AI in Witchfire." —Adrian Chmielarz, CEO of The Astronauts</p></blockquote><p>For <em>Witchfire</em>, the goal is for every final asset to be created by humans. Chmielarz has purposefully denied art made by AI—even if it's just a small touch—and made multiple artists take longer to create something by hand. This costs the studio more time (and money), all for the sake of ensuring that human touch.</p><p>"I'm really emotional about video games, like I'm really invested. This is my life," he said. "And so I want <em>Witchfire</em> to be this sort of song that one human being sings to another person. I want to keep that connection."</p><p>He likened it to how he'll go out of his way for a handmade wine glass over a mass-produced one. Even if it has imperfections and nicks, it holds a story, connecting him to the creator's passion. He values this artisanal philosophy more than he fears potential backlash for publishing a game with AI assets ("which, by the way, would be a disaster," he added).</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Nuances of How AI Can Be Used</h2><p>During the majority of the early-access period, Chmielarz has been the sole writer for <em>Witchfire</em>. As a non-native English speaker, he has used AI to proofread some of his writing, which would tweak things like "Collect a Witchfire" to "Collect Witchfire."</p><p>To be clear though, none of the ideas were generated by AI; it was just used to make the words flow well to an English-speaking audience. For the final release however, all the text will be rewritten by Nick Adderley, who is currently also working on <em>Judas</em>.</p><p>For Chmielarz, he draws a distinct line between AI to generate and AI to proofread. Ultimately, it's about whether the machine or the person is doing the creative work.</p><p>"If you ask AI to create something for you, like concept art for an enemy, and then you have a human just repaint it, that’s not a pure 100% AI-free game," he said. "To be clear, I’m not here to judge other studios for their choices. Every team has to decide what works for them and their creative process."</p><p>In our interview, it was clear to me this distinction between generating and proofreading is something he wrestled with. He values the human connection between creator and player, which AI-generated assets dilute. At the same time, using AI to proofread his non-native English during early access is something that arguably improves that connection.</p><p>"It's a super difficult situation with AI because... if I used AI to correct my English for <em>Witchfire</em>, is it okay? I think so, but maybe I should have used a human, right, to polish all that text. Maybe I should have given a job to somebody instead of using [AI], so I don't know, man," he said.</p><p>And indeed, hiring a human is what he did in preparation for the final release of <em>Witchfire</em>. Adderley is "murdering" all his text, he joked, and the human-made writing will be implemented before the game fully releases.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>AI's Uncertain Future in the Industry</h2><p>It's clear to me that Chmielarz sees different degrees of "severity," for lack of better word, when it comes to judging the use of AI. He sees the competing opinions on AI in the community, too.</p><p>"Currently there's a lot of people—really, this is not a minority—a lot of people are really clear about not wanting any AI in their games, and it is controversial, but I kind of like it because it tells me they care, right? &nbsp;They want to have contact with other humans through art," Chmielarz said.</p><p>"Now, I want to add that there are people that don't mind... that say, 'If it's going to make me a great game faster, I'm all for it,' right? But there is a really large group, I don't know if it's half of it, I have no idea, but a really large group that says no."</p><p>He also sees a sort of arms race in the industry, tying back to what Larian head Vincke said about it being "irresponsible" to not explore new technologies. What do you do if a smaller team makes a "better" game in half the time because of AI? What if it gets to the point where AI becomes an industry standard? Suddenly, you aren't competitive, and in a landscape like video games, that's a detriment to your bottom line and your employees' livelihoods.</p><p>While he didn't vilify or idolize AI, Chmielarz is sure of one thing: he's thankful that <em>Witchfire</em> ships soon instead of in five years.</p><p>"I don't think the tools at the moment are that great. Like you really can't make a game using just AI," Chmielarz said. "But in five years' time, I don't know. Every single day, I read about something absolutely crazy.</p><p>"So fortunately, in a way, we are a small fry. So we are looking at everybody else, and let's see what happens."</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Importance of Detailed Disclosure</h2><p>For the current moment, he's a fan of disclosure of AI use across the board, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/%22Currently%20there's%20a%20lot%20of%20people%E2%80%94really,%20this%20is%20not%20a%20minority%E2%80%94a%20lot%20of%20people%20are%20really%20clear%20about%20not%20wanting%20any%20AI%20in%20their%20games,%20and%20it%20is%20controversial,%20but%20I%20kind%20of%20like%20it%20because%20it%20tells%20me%20they%20care,%20right?%20%20They%20want%20to%20have%20contact%20with%20other%20humans%20through%20art,%22%20Chmielarz%20said." rel="nofollow">like what Steam offers</a>. Though he does want disclosure to be very specific so players can decide for themselves where their line is.</p><p>"For example, if it's just like one asset or whatever, then maybe that's fine. But if half of your game is using AI assets, then people might want to know that," Chmielarz said. "But again, we will see, because today, it means a lot to see that message. Maybe in five years' time, it will be meaningless, and we will remove it because everybody will be using AI and so nobody cares anymore because you just can't escape it."</p><p>There's some cynicism in his outlook for the future, but he also believes that players have the power to impact where the industry is going with AI. Though of course, this relies on developers being transparent.</p><p>"Ultimately, the decision will basically be made by the players. If they refuse to buy games that are clearly done using AI, the message will be clear, and people will be not using AI in their games, [it's] as simple as that," he said.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In his personal life, Chmielarz uses ChatGPT and Gemini over Google searches, much to his teenage daughter's dismay. It understands when he talks, making it faster and convenient. However, he also knows its current limitations and always asks it to provide sources—though even those links can be hallucinations, too.</p><p>In his professional life though, AI carries a lot more weight because of the impact it has already had in such a short time. It's quickly become an instant turn-off for many gamers and a catalyst for some developers, regardless of the moral and environmental costs.</p><p>"AI is so many things, right? &nbsp;It's funny that, you know, five years ago, if you asked any gamer, 'Do you want better AI in your games?' They would say yes," he said with a laugh.</p><p>Today, the answer to that question isn't so straightforward.</p><p>"I don't know what the future holds or how strongly AI will be present in the creative process years from now. No one does. All I know is that today, we want <em>Witchfire</em> to be a product of organic creativity and passion," he said. "We'd rather spend more money as a studio and give our team the time they need to create something free from AI than compromise that vision."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/witchfire-ceo-no-ai-larian]]></content:encoded>

              <p>I’d hoped 2025 would be a better year than 2024. And in some personal ways, it was. But it was also yet another year filled with layoffs, AI slop, greedy execs, price increases, and more signs that the entire game industry is collapsing.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-bad-news-disappointments-concord-ps5-pro-1851725872">So, like</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-fees-game-awards-ai-nft-women-hacks-price-hike-1851115189">we’ve done</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/2022-gaming-elon-musk-twitter-microsoft-overwatch-2-1849865844">in years past</a>, <em>Kotaku</em> has rounded up a collection of some of the worst, most disappointing video game news and events from 2025 and catalogued it in a handy dandy list. Take breaks as you scroll through this, and let’s all hope 2026 is better. It can’t be worse, right? Please, tell me it can’t be worse. Please…</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>So Many Canceled Games</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000339"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000339">©Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This was the year in which, more than ever before, a lot of big games got canned, or we learned about projects that were binned not long ago.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531"><em>Perfect Dark</em>,</a> the slick-looking reboot of Rare’s sci-fi shooter series? Canned, and the studio behind it shuttered. A <em>Wonder Woman</em> game from Monolith? <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Canceled</a> taking the beloved studio behind <em>No One Lives Forever</em> and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> down with it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">An EA-published <em>Black Panther</em></a> game from some former Monolith devs that would have reportedly featured a version of <em>Mordor’s</em> popular Nemesis System? Dead and the studio behind it closed, too. <a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">EA also shelved a <em>Titanfall</em> extraction shooter</a> spin-off; Sony killed a few live-service games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">including a <em>God of War</em> multiplayer project</a>; and <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122">a cool-looking <em>Transformers</em></a> game from Splash Damage got the axe this year, leading to, you guessed it, layoffs.</p>

 <p>And these are just the ones that we know about. I’d bet a lot more games were canceled in 2025 as publishers continue to focus more and more on fewer franchises that can be reliably counted on to turn a profit. And as noted, many of these cancellations led to layoffs and studios being closed, a problem worth talking about separately, because in 2025, these cuts and closings happened <em>a lot.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2><strong>More Layoffs And Studio Closings&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000650604" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650604"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650604">©Three Fields Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2025 wasn’t as bad for industry layoffs as 2024, but it was still pretty terrible. Nearly 10,000 developers lost jobs, </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/games-industry-layoff-figures-were-down-slightly-in-2025-but-it-was-still-horrendous-year-in-review"><span>according to layoff tracker Amir Satvat</span></a><span>. That’s down from the over 15,000 pink-slips peak of 2025, but still up from 2022. The big cutbacks were once again at Microsoft, which shaved hundreds of jobs across its gaming division, including at Rare, Zenimax, and King.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But those were hardly the only ones. Notable teams like Cloud Chamber, working on</span><i><span> BioShock 4,</span></i><span> lost dozens of staff, Amazon Gaming cut over 100 positions, and Square Enix made cuts across its international publishing business. Indies were also still hit hard. Heart Machine had to lay people off and end <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> Early Access development early, while <em>Wreckreation</em> maker <a href="https://kotaku.com/burnout-co-founder-studio-three-fields-wreckreation-closing-down-patreon-2000650564">Three Fields Entertainment turned to Patreon as it looks for new funding</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Randomly looking up the developer behind</span><i><span> Floppy Knights</span></i><span> to see what they were working on next, only to find </span><a href="https://www.rosecitygames.com/news/thanks-for-playing"><span>a shutdown notice</span></a><span> on their homepage, pretty much summed up the ongoing industry vibe.&nbsp; – Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong>Generative AI Slop Spreads Through The Game Industry</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000651805" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651805"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651805">©McDonald’s / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Generative AI isn’t new tech. It’s been floating around for a few years now. But in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">it felt like AI popped up more than ever</a> across different games and studios. Swen Vincke, the head of&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;</em>maker Larian Studios, <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">stepped into it big time in December</a> after he sounded shockingly bullish on AI generation tools. And Vincke wasn’t alone. Plenty of other video game executives and bosses had lots of positive things to say about AI generation tools.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-swen-vincke-larian-bruce-straley-ai-warhorse-2000654591"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> director Daniel Vávra</a> is all for AI usage if it lets his studio make games faster. Chris Cocks, the CEO of <em>D&amp;D</em> parent company Hasbro, said AI is <a href="https://kotaku.com/guy-in-charge-of-d-d-says-ai-is-supercharging-fandom-1851768792">“supercharging fandom.”</a> Nexon CEO Junghun Lee, whose company owns the studio behind<em> Arc Raiders,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">said in an interview</a> that it’s “important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” and that other companies needed to rely on the tech to “increase [their] competitiveness.”<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-gen-ai-arc-raiders-brendan-green-2000644914"><em> Helldivers 2</em> boss Shams Jorjani thinks</a> people are being too quick to dismiss AI and called <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ use of the tech interesting, adding that in his view the tech “actually makes gaming better.” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/level-5-ceo-says-games-are-now-being-made-80-90-by-ai-making-aesthetic-sense-a-must-for-developers/">Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino reportedly said</a> that it’s “becoming common sense in the creative world to rely on the power of AI to boost work efficiency.” Level-5 is the studio behind <em>Professor Layton</em> and <em>Ni No Kuni.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>The gung-ho attitude so many gaming execs and bosses have toward gen AI tools likely explains how ugly, wonky AI slop keeps ending up in big video games, including<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167"> Battlefield 6</a>,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>,</a>&nbsp; <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">Anno 117: Pax Romana,</a>&nbsp;</em>and others. And despite players almost universally being against AI art and other slop, this trend isn’t going away in 2026. PUBG publisher Krafton plans to spend nearly $70 million on becoming an “<a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-ai-pubg-bloodlines-2-motion-blur-2000638553">AI-first” company</a>. Ubisoft, meanwhile, is investing a lot into leveraging the controversial tech into its future video games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251">even showing off an FPS that was built entirely around AI tech</a>.</p> <p>The shit has even worked its way into <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-gzdoom-source-port-graf-zahl-ai-chatgpt-2000636055">stuff like GZDoom</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazons-fallout-season-1-recap-is-inaccurate-ai-wrong-slop-2000652678">television show recaps</a>. This is our future. It fucking sucks, and until the AI bubble pops, we all will have to put up with more slop in 2026, so greedy execs can make the line go up more by replacing devs and artists with AI chatbots and hoping gamers eventually get over it.</p>

 <h2><strong>Playing Video Games Is Becoming A Very Expensive Hobby</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000003611" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003611"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003611">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never been cheap to play video games. But in 2025, this already expensive hobby became even more pricey. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/2025-video-game-price-increases">As noted by Stephen Totilo over at <em>Game File,</em></a> since April, there have been eight price hikes total from<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220"> Nintendo</a>,<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"> Sony</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">Microsoft</a> on consoles, accessories, and subscriptions. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">This is likely one big reason why console sales were in the gutter in November.</a> And even if you tried to buy a used Xbox or PS5 to save money, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-cant-believe-how-much-microsoft-is-selling-used-xbox-consoles-for-2000650923">it would still likely be more expensive than that same console would have cost at launch</a> in 2020.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nintendo became the first publisher to break a shocking price barrier when it announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">Switch 2 launch title <em>Mario Kart World</em> would be priced at $80</a>. Later, Xbox announced that <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> would also be $80, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-outer-worlds-2-price-80-lowered-70-pre-order-pc-1851786791">but the backlash was so strong</a> that it relented and lowered the price to $70. However, Xbox didn’t back down on raising prices on Game Pass and turned the service, once called the best deal in gaming by many, <span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into</a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">&nbsp;a more complicated and expensive subscription service</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">Sony raised prices on PlayStation Plus as well.</a></p>

 <p>Perhaps you decide to skip consoles entirely, build a PC, and take advantage of all the great deals on stores like Steam and GOG. Well, thanks to a number of factors, including tech companies gobbling up parts for AI usage and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">President Trump’s idiotic tariffs</a>, <a href="https://overclock3d.net/news/memory/ddr5-nightmare-memory-prices-continue-to-skyrocket/">RAM and other PC parts</a> are<a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803"> becoming more and more expensive</a>. And this also means that PC handhelds, like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, will likely cost more when newer versions are announced, and prices on existing models will probably increase.<a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-game-over-for-the-steam-deck-lcd-rip-2022-2025-2000702545"> Valve has also announced</a> that it is done making the cheapest version of the Steam Deck, which isn’t good news for folks looking for an affordable and accessible entry into PC gaming. I mean, none of this is good news, and with rumors swirling that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">next-gen machines will be expensive</a> behemoths, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">I’d recommend gamers start saving up money as we enter 2026.</a></p> <h2><strong>Valve And Credit Card Companies Decide What Games Are Allowed To Exist</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614399"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614399">©EroticGamesClub</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281"><span>five months</span></a><span> since <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-nsfw-adult-games-visa-mastercard-collective-shout-2000614199">Steam and itch.io</a> began purging certain NSFW games from their storefronts following pressure from payment processors like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">Mastercard.</a> Despite an immediate backlash and ongoing calls not to let banks censor art, tons of games remain unavailable to purchase on the world’s biggest PC gaming storefronts. </span></p> <p><span>The worst part of all is that it’s still not even clear who the corporate partners are trying to appease with the crackdown.

 <h2><strong>The $55 Billion Saudi / EA Deal</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655345"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655345">©EA / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Electronic Arts is probably not anyone’s favorite publisher, given it’s responsible for turning some beloved IPs into live-service slop and gutting certain teams under its umbrella after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>undermining them for decades</span></a><span>, but nobody wants to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shareholders-approve-55bn-sale-saudi-arabia-trump-2000655342">a company bought out by the Saudi government</a>. </span></p> <p><span>Though EA claims it will maintain creative freedom after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">$55 billion deal is signed, sealed, and delivered</a>, all it takes is one person from on high to say that BioWare can’t include queer relationships in </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>or that </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> is now going to focus exclusively on the nuclear family for all of that independence to go away.

It was going to be a </span><em>GTA</em><span>-like semi-open-world action game that tied into a larger suite of online game creation tools that people could use to build their own experiences, ala </span><em>Roblox</em><span> or </span><em>Fortnite</em><span>. Instead, what </span><em>Mindseye</em><span> ended up being when it launched earlier this year </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108">was a complete disaster</a><span>. It was extremely buggy, ran like crap, was filled with boring missions, and felt sterile and empty. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-worst-games-of-2025-according-to-metacritic-mindseye-fire-emblem-glover-2000653114">It was easily one of the worst games of the year</a><span>, and it likely jeopardizes the future of Benzies’ studio and other projects.</span></p> <h2><strong>President Trump’s Gaming Posts And The Lack Of Any Pushback</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618902" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618902"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618902">©Rockstar Games / Comedy Central / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Trump administration turning fascist propaganda into the stuff of memes isn’t terribly surprising, but it’s disappointing that some of the biggest companies in video games just let him use their IP to do it. Microsoft and The Pokémon Company both saw their creations used in posts from the Trump administration trying to recruit nerds to join ICE, and while The Pokémon Company said it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>hadn’t given permission</span></a><span> for the use of its work, it stopped short of condemning the video post of ICE agents “catching” immigrants set to the iconic anime theme song from the ‘90s. Microsoft, meanwhile, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>didn’t say a goddamn word</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>With the current administration being this brain-rotted and online, I imagine most people want to just keep their heads down and not put the spotlight on themselves for longer than they have to. But if </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sabrina-carpenter-ice-video-juno-song-response-trump-2000649672"><span>Sabrina Carpenter</span></a><span> can tell Trump to eat shit, so can you, Master Chief. – Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><strong>The Continued Death Of Physical Media</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000003245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003245"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003245">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>2024 was a bad year for physical media, and 2025 just brought more bad news on that front. Some physical game releases on the Switch 2, the hottest new console around, make use of Game Key Cards, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">which are basically little pieces of plastic that don’t contain the game</a>, but instead a digital DRM key that lets you download and play a specific game. They rely on the internet and Nintendo’s servers, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-classic-games-mario-zelda-eshop-shop-1848544931">that should make everyone nervous.</a></p>

 <p>Meanwhile, I walked into a Target to do some Christmas shopping and discovered that my local store has just stopped selling Xbox games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446"><em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> skipped</a> a physical Xbox release entirely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">And PlayStation made only 3 percent of its total profits in 2024 from physical game sales.</a> Yikes. While physical games aren’t going away entirely in 2026, it does seem like the era of stores filled with aisles of games to buy is long gone.</p> <h2><strong><em>GTA 6</em> Delayed Twice As Rockstar Faces Accusations Of Union Busting</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002650"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002650">©Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, possibly the most highly anticipated video game release in a decade, suffered two more delays in 2025. Originally, Rockstar’s long-awaited open-world crime sim was supposed to launch this year, with many anticipating a fall arrival. But in the spring, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799">the game was delayed until May 2026</a>. Fans were given a second trailer to make up for the delay and marked the new date on their calendars. And then, about six months later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787">Rockstar announced another delay</a>, pushing <em>GTA 6</em> back all the way until November 2026.</p>

 <p>Of course, this wasn’t the most disappointing news to come from Rockstar Games in 2025. No, that would be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">union-busting accusations leveled against the company</a> after it fired over two dozen employees for allegedly sharing confidential information on Discord. The staff who were fired deny these allegations and, with the support of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain, <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/">continued to</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-workers-protest-nyc/">protest at Rockstar’s offices.</a> This whole situation has blown up so much that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-union-busting-firing-keir-starmer-2000652135">UK’s Prime Minister has openly called out Rockstar Games</a> and demanded further investigation. It’s clear this isn’t going away like Rockstar Games likely hoped, and when (if?)<em> GTA 6</em> finally launches in 2026, the company’s firing of these employees will likely be a hot topic among the press and fans.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/govee-retail-push-brighten-uk-gaming/</link>
            <guid>1391545</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever assembled a top-tier gaming setup, you’ll likely understand the importance of <strong>good lighting</strong>. Whether you’re putting together a streaming room or simply jazzing up your console space, adding a splash of RGB or a strip light or two is almost mandatory for modern gamers.</p>



<p>Enter Govee, one of the most trusted, reliable, and innovative names in the smart lighting space. The brand has pushed deep into the UK market with a new dive into the catalogues of major retailers. I’ve long been a fan of Govee’s products, and recently, I was able to sample the new Christmas range.</p>



<p>Check out what’s coming below with an all-new sale that has kicked off <strong>today</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-govee-s-illuminating-range-elevates-your-gaming-setup">Govee’s Illuminating Range Elevates Your Gaming Setup</h2>



<p>Govee has a mind-boggling range of lighting solutions, from corner and desk lamps to AI-powered television-based backlights. It has more strip lights and panels than you can handle, and it accommodates everything from a festive display to adding a burst of intuitive color to a gaming setup.</p>



<p>This Christmas, Govee has made a bold push into the UK retail market, offering an extensive range of lighting solutions at both Currys and Argos.</p>



<p>If you’re a gamer and you’re trying to brighten your setup, you <strong>can not go wrong </strong>with a little Govee in your life.</p>



<p>I was lucky enough to trial some of the most attractive offerings in the lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/govee-envisual-3s-smart-5565-tv-backlight-10268158.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Envisual TV Backlight</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7567814?clickSR=slp:term:govee:6:25:1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aura Smart Desk Lamp</a></li>
</ul>



<p>I should stress I’ve been using Govee lights for years. I’ve got smart RGBIC strips that illuminate the background of every stream, video, and session I produce, all manipulated via a handy app that allows for seamless remote control.</p>



<p>The Envisual TV Backlight is a phenomenal thing that uses a calibrated, mounted camera to detect what’s on your screen and relay it to a smart lighting solution <strong>in real time</strong>. It provides an expansion to the color already on your screen, bathing the wall behind your television with an innovative, energetic light.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Aura Smart Desk Lamp is something much simpler. It’s a plug-and-play lamp that sits nicely on the desk of my PC setup, offering a one-touch solution to gorgeous lighting. It’s a versatile little device that has low power draw but <strong>bright, sumptuous </strong>outputs, and it can be customized extensively, just like the Envisual.</p>



<p>Beyond these items I received, the ranges found at Currys and Argos this Christmas will have your head spinning. You’re quite simply spoiled for choice with what Govee has on offer.</p>



<p>For instance, there’s the <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/govee-ai-sync-smart-5565-tv-backlight-10277225.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Sync Smart TV Backlight</a> solution, which uses a powerful AI-driven mechanic called CogniGlow and feeds your screen’s content into an RGBWIC strip that will blow your hair back. That’s at the top of the Govee table and has a price point of £199.99, but with the new Christmas sale on, you can definitely find more items to suit a smaller budget.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market for a new lighting solution and you’re (ideally) located in the UK, don’t sleep on Govee. This is one of the best lighting providers I’ve ever rubbed shoulders with.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got a Govee lighting solution in your home.</p>

            <p>Danganronpa, a game series I can never reliably spell, has just passed 10m sales, maker <a href="https://www.spike-chunsoft.com/news/danganronpa-series-surpasses-10-million-units-shipped-worldwide/">Spike Chunshoft has announced</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/danganronpa-and-the-surprising-joys-of-clumsy-queer-representation">Best described by a 2023 Danganronpa Pride Week article</a> as "a Battle-Royale-meets-Ace-Attorney visual novel series that is, quite frankly, insane," Danganronpa began in 2010 on PlayStation Portable. Since then it's had three mainline series entries, two spin-offs, and is preparing for a new game, Danganronpa 2x2, next year. This will feature a new scenario and a revamped one from Danganronpa 2.</p>
<p>In the Danganronpa games, you play as high school students who are forced to kill each other by way of a bear plushie that likes to monologue. Gameplay combines debating with sharpshooting. It's a bizarre mix.</p>
<p>"Entertainment media has us geared to believe that we're always safe in the company of those we're familiar with, despite clear evidence of the contrary," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-danganronpa-so-viciously-appealing">a separate article about Danganronpa, which explored the series' vicious appeal</a>.</p>
<p>"Danganronpa ups the ante by presenting another variable to that thought. What do you do when you can't trust the people in charge, or those who stand as sterling examples of our community? What then? Where does that leave the middle-classed and the ordinary?</p><p>"Building on careful layers of paranoia, Danganronpa is a game about archetypes being stripped down and dissected, a game about the degradation of a supposed utopia, and a game with surprisingly good writing. And a game that's certainly worth picking up."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: Fortnite Has To Be Considered The Best Free-To-Play Game Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-fortnite-has-to-be-considered-the-best-free-to-play-game-ever/</link>
            <guid>1391527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I would go as far as saying that Fortnite might be the most incredible, rich library of content jam-packed into one game. Fortnite, outside of its Save The World component, is free-to-play across at least 10 platforms, from PlayStation to iOS. It might be harder to argue that Fortnite <em>isn’t </em>the best free-to-play game ever at this point.</p>



<p>As someone who hadn’t touched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-chapter-7-the-last-chapter-of-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> properly (outside of the odd work purpose) for roughly seven years, it’s hard to describe the blast I had with Fortnite when I hopped in for the now-legendary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-simpsons-fortnite-hidden-gag-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons</a> collaboration. The cartoon is one I hold dear to my heart, and getting to run around Springfield—with more Easter Eggs than a Cadbury’s factory—was more than enough justification to pull me back in.</p>



<p>Fortnite really does have no limits now, and it gets to a point where you simply have to take your hat off to Epic and say, “Bravo.”</p>







<h2 id="h-it-had-been-longer-than-a-fortnite-sorry-fortnight">It Had Been Longer Than A Fortnite, Sorry, Fortnight</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve come so far. Credit Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>There I was, getting ready to play my first full game of Fortnite in seven years, in my 2018 Rabbit Raider skin, feeling lost. Within minutes, I remembered why I put so many hours into the game in its first year or so. The crispy movement, the satisfying nature of the gunplay; while maps, loot, skins, and events have all come and gone, the game’s fundamentals remain rooted in their simplicity and success.</p>







<p>Fortnite is simply a fun video game, accessible and suitable for all ages. This makes its appeal worldwide and endless. An alien could fly down from another galaxy and probably start dropping 10-kill games before long. I could never adjust to the building nature of Fortnite’s formative years, making Zero Build a metaphorical heaven for myself. Skill issue, boomer issue, whatever you want to call it, I don’t care. Zero Build breathed new life into Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Fortnite package is a world buffet at this point. It offers almost every option and targets accessibility across the board. Generally, Epic Games delivers what people want. This brings in more players and retains its already sizable base. Currently in Fortnite, you have the following free-to-play options:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fortnite Battle Royale</li>



<li>Fortnite Creative</li>



<li>LEGO Fortnite</li>



<li>Rocket Racing</li>



<li>Fortnite Festival</li>



<li>Fortnite Ballistic</li>
</ul>



<p>I could go on. Here, you’ve got a complete battle royale game, a Rocket League/kart racer hybrid, a custom LEGO world builder, a Counter-Strike alternative, etc. These are fully fledged games within one game, with one common trend—they’re all free.</p>



<p>Its player base never seems to drastically waver either. According to <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite.GG</a>, it was only a year ago that the game hit its all-time player peak of 14,343,880 concurrent players, and while 2025’s highest only delivered 9,745,466 concurrent players, this is still lightyears beyond most other free-to-play games. Yes, Roblox has more players, but is it offering the level of high-grade polish?</p>



<h2 id="h-a-license-to-license">A License To…License</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Every time you think there’s a boundary Fortnite can’t cross, it does. The day Kratos and Master Chief walked into Fortnite was huge. The licenses and collaborations have snowballed since: Marvel, Star Wars, DC, Squid Game, Sabrina Carpenter, WWE, you name it, Fortnite has pretty much done it all.</p>



<p>2026 is already lining up Back To The Future, Kill Bill, Playboi Carti, and, allegedly, South Park and Harry Potter are on the way. There is no mountain that Fortnite can’t climb, and there’s not a single license safe from Epic Games. The company is willing to pay millions and billions in the hope you’ll part ways with your real-life V-Bucks.</p>



<p>Now, we come full circle. Fortnite took a huge gamble by turning the Fortnite map into one big homage to The Simpsons. It drew big numbers for the game, and there are a lot of Simpsons fans. Epic is not only able to get a sizable The Simpsons crossover like this, but also isn’t afraid to take a chance on something so drastic that it remains permanent for weeks on end.</p>



<p>Fortnie in 2025 has gone up another level, and the same is likely to happen in 2026. Is there a free-to-play game still played by millions of people every year, offering this much (and depth) of content, pretty much beloved by everyone? If you can think of one, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let us know. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For years Grand Theft Auto fans have wondered whether Rockstar might take the franchise out of its traditional America setting into cities in other countries. But according to one former developer, that’s never going to happen — and fans just need to accept it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gameshub</a>, former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij, who worked at the company from 1995 to 2009, said there were “ideas” about post-Liberty City, San Andreas, and Vice City GTA games set in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow, and Istanbul, but it was GTA: Tokyo that “almost actually happened.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Vermeij, who left Rockstar just after finishing GTA 4, another studio in Japan was going to take Rockstar’s code and develop GTA: Tokyo (Vermeij didn’t say which studio). “But then that didn’t happen in the end.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? It sounds like Rockstar came to the realization that American cities are the natural and best setting for GTA, and given it takes so long to release new games in the series, going international is too big of a risk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People love having these wild ideas but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it it’s too easy to go let’s do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there,” Vermeij said. “They have a mental image of the cities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s unlikely it’s going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there’s just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn’t make sense to set it in some left-field location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn’t work.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is of course set to return to Vice City, the GTA series’ fictionalized take on Miami, Florida. But then what? Will Rockstar ever take GTA international and set it across mainland Europe or in London?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s just not realistic,” Vermeij countered. “I would love it, and if games still took a year to make then yeah sure, you can have a little fun, but you’re not going to get that when there’s a GTA every 12 years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re not going to set it in a new location. You don’t really need to either because the technology changes so much. Nobody is going to say that they’re not going to play GTA 6 because they’ve already played Vice City. That doesn’t make sense. It’s completely different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’ll revisit New York again. They’ll go back to LA or maybe Las Vegas. I’m afraid we’re stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let’s just get used to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vermeij’s comments here echo those of Rockstar co-founder and former boss Dan Houser, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-needed-guns-you-needed-these-larger-than-life-characters-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-explains-why-grand-theft-auto-wont-leave-the-united-states">who recently explained why the Grand Theft Auto series won’t leave the United States in terms of its setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=udC7HKm43mCRmXtt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Lex Fridman podcast</u></a>, Houser said that — GTA London apart — Grand Theft Auto remained firmly rooted in the United States because it leans so heavily on Americana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We made a little thing in London 26 years ago — GTA London — for the top-down for PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation 1. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.”</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, such is GTA’s relationship with America, built up over the course of its many video games, that a University of Tennessee history professor will teach a GTA college history class early in 2026. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-got-a-gta-college-history-class-before-gta-6"><u>Professor Tore Olsson recently told IGN</u></a>: “Video games are great at conjuring fictional worlds, but they also impact players’ thinking about real-world times and places. And just as Red Dead Redemption 2 has shaped folks’ perception of the nineteenth-century American West or Ghost of Tsushima has informed their vision of feudal Japan, millions of people around the globe imagine contemporary America through the lens of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Just think of how many GTA veterans have recognized landmarks in Los Angeles and New York thanks to their hours in Los Santos and Liberty City!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser’s position on GTA is similar to that of the creators of post-apocalyptic role-playing game series Fallout, which has also remained in the United States. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us"><u>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard ruled out leaving the U.S. behind for a future Fallout video game</u></a>, saying he’s a big fan of the “Americana naivete” that informs so much of Fallout’s tone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has stoked the Fallout 5 fires by saying the franchise is "the one we're still doing the most work in above anything".</p>
<p>His comments partially relate to online multiplayer game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, which has been an ongoing project at the studio since its <a href="http://a/">very wobbly release in 2018</a>. Its existence means that while Bethesda hasn't released a mainline single-player Fallout game since 4 in 2015, Bethesda has had a Fallout team working continually since then. But the team hasn't solely been working on 76.</p>
<p>"I will say, first, looking at 76, we've never stopped developing Fallout. We've had a full team on Fallout for a long time. So, Fallout, as a franchise, is the one we're still doing the most work in above anything," <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned">Howard told Game Informer</a>.</p>
<p>"Now, the majority of our internal studio is on Elder Scrolls 6. We are doing other things with Fallout that we haven't announced, and you know, there'll come a time for that. I get the sort of anxiety from fans, like, 'Well, what else? What else? Feed me!' But, look, we're working on stuff, and we do like to wait. And so, I think there'll be a moment to talk about that, and we want to make those special moments for our fans."</p>

I suspect Howard and team will leave it later in Fallout 5's development to properly announce the game; we could have another <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>-like scenario where there are only several months between announcement and release.</p><p>It's also important to note how much has changed at Bethesda Game Studios since it released Fallout 4. Fallout 76 - a multiplayer game - was a significant departure for the studio, and Starfield represented the studio's most ambitious project yet as a completely new IP. Moreover, both games were not instant hits and required significant additional work after they came out. Such things change a studio, as studio director Angela Browder pointed out.</p>
<p>"I think every one of [our past games] is a learning experience, right? Let's take Fallout 76 – yes, we learned how to make multiplayer; we also learned what it means when you ship a product that doesn't necessarily hit really well right away," Browder said. "And we learned about investing and listening to our players and strengthening who we are and what we are, our own ability to resiliency and adversity, all these kinds of things, right?</p>
<blockquote><em>"We also learned what it means when you ship a product that doesn't necessarily hit really well right away"</em></blockquote>
<p>"When you talk about Starfield, we made the biggest thing we've ever done in our entire lives: we made space. I'm scared of space, I think space is really scary, but we made space! Everything that we learned by putting space into Starfield goes into Elder Scrolls 6. It's all learning.</p>
<p>"We are better developers for having made a multiplayer game, we are better developers for having developed our own IP now, because it's new muscles," Browder added. "It's tested us in a different way. It's taught us a lot of things that we never could have known otherwise. And I do think even as we go into titles that are IP we've made before that we classically understand, we're still better developers for having done it, because your brain thinks differently once you've done those kinds of things. And I think it's only going to make every title we do better."</p><p>Bethesda has collaborated on the Fallout TV series since then, too, of course, the first series of which aired last year, the second series of which began this month, and a third series of which has already been greenlit. And it's very good - very faithful to the almost absurd nature of the games, which juxtaposes a kind of relentless upbeatness next to a ridiculously brutal and unforgiving world. Todd Howard has already said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">Fallout 5 will take place in a timeline that acknowledges the TV series</a>, set either after the events of it or during it.</p>
<p>There's never been a better time for more Fallout, then. The question is simply when it will arrive. The sweepstakes are open - get your guesses in now.</p>

<p>The latest entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_s_ultimate_summer_camp">Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp</a>, released for the Switch back in 2021, but fans can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/danganronpa-2x2">Danganronpa 2x2</a> on Switch and Switch 2 in 2026, an enhanced version of the second mainline game.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/spyro-4-game-leaked-via-ex-toys-for-bob-developers-resume/</link>
            <guid>1391479</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fans of the dragon-themed platform series owned by <strong>Activision</strong> are getting an early Holiday present this year with the leaked news that a <strong>Spyro 4</strong> game is in development. The information was first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqQsIoR2rXk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by YouTuber 'Canadian Guy Eh', who noticed that a former <strong>Toys for Bob</strong> developer included on his LinkedIn resume that he worked on 'Spyro' for nearly two years up until March 2024.</p>



<p>Given the timeline, this cannot possibly be related to the <strong>Reignited Trilogy</strong>, which was first released on November 13, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and later <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-confirmed-for-pc-switch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted on PC and Nintendo Switch</a> on September 3, 2019. Chances are, then, this is the next project in development at Toys for Bob.</p>



<p>Some readers may recall that the studio, based in Novato, California, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-developer-suffers-layoffs-will-work-on-call-of-duty-warzone-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assigned to assist with Call of Duty Warzone</a> for a period of time in 2021. Toys for Bob later launched <strong>Crash Team Rumble</strong>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-rumble-is-all-about-taking-platforming-into-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4v4 team-based multiplayer game</a>, in June 2023. The game wasn't received well, though, and by March 2024, the studio had decided to separate from Activision (and therefore from its new owner, Microsoft), <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bob-goes-indie-but-will-still-likely-partner-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regaining its independence</a>. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bobs-first-independent-game-will-still-be-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, their first independent project is still expected to be made in partnership with Microsoft and, therefore, based on one of its IPs, of which Spyro is certainly one they're familiar with.</p>



<p>A Spyro 4 rumor actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-4-teased-in-crash-4-its-about-time-art-book-concept-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first circulated five years ago</a>, when it was discovered that the official art book of the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a></strong> (also developed by Toys for Bob) included new concept art related to the cute purple dragon.</p>



<p>While we wait for an official announcement, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/spyro-reignited-trilogy-classics-reborn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Reignited Trilogy</a> is currently available at a 65% discount on PC (Steam) and Xbox, whereas PlayStation users can only buy it at full price ($39.99) right now via the PlayStation Store. Spyro Reignited Trilogy <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-flies-to-game-pass-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can also be found on the Game Pass subscription</a> service at the Premium and Ultimate tiers.</p>

<p>After a bug almost cancelled Christmas!</p>

<p>Although it seems to be the end of the road for the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, in-game events will still be taking place over the next year.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, the event that was previously scheduled had to be suspended due to a bug. Thankfully, just in time for Christmas, the updated event has now been given the all-clear to go ahead.</p>
<p>Here's a rough translation of the notice shared on the official Kirby Air Riders social media account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>【Event】<br>
The event "Race to the Finish! City Trial," which was suspended due to a glitch, will be restarted with the rules changed to "Everyone Together! Same Stadium."<br>
There will be no changes to the lineup of participation rewards, which includes the "Santa" hat.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adwgozyn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>▼Event Period<br>
From December 24, 2025 (Wed) 12:00 to December 29, 2025 (Mon) 12:00</p>
<p>【Event】<br>
Event points will be reset to 0, but to make it easier for you to obtain all rewards up to the final one, we have set the points earned per match to be higher than usual.</p>
<p>Once again, we are truly sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As noted, this event will take place between now and <strong>29th December 2025</strong>, and there is a special "Santa hat" reward available.</p>
<p>Game director <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/2003387170883797265">Masahiro Sakurai also issued an apology</a> on his social account about this inconvenience, while acknowledging how the team still "somehow managed to make it in time for Christmas".</p>

<p>"The first CoD Switch version is nearly done"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8b372b96a42be"><a title="Call of Duty Warzone" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b372b96a42be/call-of-duty-warzone.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following a rumour last week about Bethesda's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield">Starfield</a> coming to the Switch 2 next year, there's now been a supposed update about the Nintendo version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>According to Windows Central executive editor Jez Corden, the "first" Call of Duty Switch release is "nearly done" and could be launching in just a matter of months. He goes on to mention how it's definitely "on the way" and has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530">apparently been "hitting milestones"</a>, so a 2026 release window looks like a possibility.</p>

<p>Our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/rumour-xbox-nearly-done-with-first-version-of-call-of-duty-for-nintendo-switch"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a> have shared their thoughts about what this release might even be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're going to guess this probably relates to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_warzone_2_0">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> — the ever-evolving free-to-play experience — rather than a port of Black Ops 7 that may get in the way of a potential Call of Duty mainline release in late 2026."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdlnsrox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms">original 10-year deal</a> was made to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms, there have been multiple reports about how it's still on the way. Most recently, in November, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/call-of-duty-dev-sledgehammer-games-seeking-talent-with-switch-experience">Call of Duty job applications</a> seeking "Switch experience" were discovered.</p>
<p>Activision also shared an update earlier this month about the Call of Duty series "going forward", mentioning how its development and release strategy was changing. This followed on from a negative fan reception to the latest outing, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, this follows the news last week from the same source, claiming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/rumour-bethesdas-newest-ip-is-still-reportedly-on-course-for-switch-2">Starfield will land on the Switch 2</a> at some point next year.</p>

<p>When the Switch 2 was announced, many Nintendo fans were already calling for themes to be added to the HOME Menu.</p>
<p>While there have been no developments on this front, there is something else that <em>some</em> fans are excited about. From the system HOME Menu, if you navigate to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' icon, you'll be presented with a "Happy Holidays" theme featuring Mario and the rest of the crew.</p>
<p>This limited-time theme has even got its own music, and when you flick through the menu, a jingle sound effect plays.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067svqthw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The music appears to be 'Snowball Park' from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and there's also a small easter egg. If you <a href="https://x.com/DeboReynoldsJr/status/2001893719860293660">navigate to the bottom of the menu</a> and keep pushing the analogue stick down, you'll see some Mario-themed characters and a "Happy Holidays" message pop up.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we've seen themes added to <em>other</em> sections of Switch systems before, and it probably won't be the last.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo is also offering special holiday-themed Switch Online icons. You can get these icons for 10 Platinum Points each, and borders and backgrounds will set you back 5 Platinum Points each.</p>

<p>But you can keep it anyway</p>

<figure data-uuid="ddc17bf70fdbe"><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ddc17bf70fdbe/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: CD PROJEKT RED</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> for the Switch 2 was spotted going for <strong>75% off</strong> its regular price in the US, reducing it from $69.99 down to just <strong>$17.49</strong>.</p>
<p>Fans were convinced it was an error, and now, sure enough, <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/2003602413702512780">CD Project Red has confirmed</a> the price displayed on the Switch 2 digital store "in the Americas on December 22, 2025" was "incorrect". It seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</a> for Switch was also accidentally discounted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, CDPR is in a festive mood, and if you did manage to purchase either of these games at the discounted prices, you'll be able to keep them. Here's the official notice about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CD PROJEKT RED:</strong> The discounts for Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition displayed on Nintendo Switch 2 eShop in the Americas on December 22, 2025 were incorrect.</p>
<p>The situation is a result of an error we made when submitting the discount. We have corrected the error and new discounts have now been applied.</p>
<p>Purchases made at the previous discount rate are unaffected by this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there have been "new discounts" applied to the titles in the Americas. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is currently available for <strong>$39.99</strong> instead of $69.99 (that's <strong>42% off</strong>), and the Witcher 3 Complete Edition on Switch is now priced at <strong>$14.99</strong> instead of $59.99 (<strong>75% off</strong>).</p>
<p>The Ultimate Edition of Cyberpunk 2077 includes not only the base game, but also the DLC expansion <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Phantom Liberty</a></strong>. And the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 comes loaded with Geralt's original adventure and the two expansions.</p>

                <p>In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a> Twitch channel within a limited time.</p><p>Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-finally-completes-hardcore-minecraft-but-some-arent-happy/1100-6536784/" data-ref-id="1100-6536784">Minecraft Hardcore</a> run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can "see" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model.</p><p>Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N29b-o4fJBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N29b-o4fJBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When Neuro beat the world record for the first time, she was rewarded with a global emote from Twitch--one which can be used anywhere on the platform, by anyone, whether they're following her channel or not. She's the first streamer to consecutively hold two Twitch Hype Train world records, so it remains to be seen whether a similar protocol will follow this achievement.</p><p>After beating her world record again, Vedal prompted Neuro to comment on the achievement. "I'm speechless," she said. "I'm blown away by the amount of support. Thank you so much everyone." Vedal had some further comments, adding, "This has changed my life completely. I'm very grateful that I have the opportunity to do something cool like this and that you guys are here to support it, but I do not deserve it." Neuro was quick to dispel her creator's self-doubt though, saying, "It doesn't matter whether you think you deserve it. What matters is that you've created something unique, and people are willing to support that." The wholesome exchange stopped short of Vedal telling Neuro he loves her too, though. Shame.</p><p>As it stands, Neuro-Sama's subathon is now set to end in around 345 hours. You can watch the rest of her antics on <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987's Twitch </a>channel.</p>
