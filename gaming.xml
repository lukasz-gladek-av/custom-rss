            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizard of the Coast's and Archetype Entertainment's <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is now out. This tabletop adaptation of the AAA sci-fi game, announced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">limited info in 2024</a>, is shipping out, and it provides a spacefaring twist on the rules of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Exodus TTRPG Release</h2>

<p>On their official webpage, Wizards of the Coast are selling two <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG books. The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> contains rules for both players and Game Masters to help them get started. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> contains rules on alien creatures, beings that inhabit abandoned starships, and uncharted worlds.</p>

The game's creative head is James Ohlen, a game industry veteran whose work includes the original <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Aside from some pre-rendered trailers and an episode in the Prime Video anthology series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, not much else is known about its core gameplay or its setting.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG helps shed some light in this regard. According to a deep dive <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/exodus/dnd-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wargamer</a>, players take on the role of Travelers. They are a community of space explorers who seek riches and advanced technology to bring back to their home world. The catch is that there is time dilation with FTL travel, meaning by the time they return home, years will have passed.</p>

<p>As for the RPG system at its core, it's <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition with some sci-fi tweaks. Gameplay caps at level 10 instead of level 20, but players' stats increase faster thanks to a Constellation tattoo mechanic. The game features four classes, each with two subclasses. Lastly, magic and magic items are replaced with substantive equipment, gear, augmentations, and spaceships.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is the latest part of a transmedia marketing approach to the Exodus game. This transmedia approach includes a novel, and the Star Heist actual play series.</p>

<p>The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> is available at an MSRP of $28.55. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> is being sold for $35.99. Alternatively, the two-book bundle is available for $64.54.</p>

              <p>Two free mods for the PC version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a> that removed the clothes from one of the game’s main female characters were removed by publisher Take-Two Interactive using a DMCA request.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a>, a pair of NSFW nude mods for the recently released linear action game <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>have been removed from popular modding site Nexus Mods by Take Two’s lawyers, according to a Nexus customer support representative on <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/">the site’s forums</a>. One of the nude mods replaced Isabella Torrisi’s in-game model with a nude version.&nbsp; The other mod, “Extended Textures For Nude Isabella,” allowed players to modify the character’s model, letting them give her “bigger nipples, bigger areola,” and even offering “cute pubic hair” options, according to text still indexed on Google search results. Both of these mods were created by Nexus user norskpl.</p> <p>“A takedown/DMCA request was issued by Lisa Deere [on behalf of Take Two Interactive Software, Inc.] on 08/12/2025,” posted a Nexus mod rep on the forums. “We were able to internally verify the legitimacy of this claim through the requesting of additional evidence to prove the identity of the claimant and the rights they hold over the content in question.”</p> <p>Interestingly, screenshots of the mod seem to indicate that norskpl didn’t create the nude model of Isabella themselves, but instead ripped it out of a different part of <em>The </em><em>Old Country</em> which features a nude Torrisi in bed with another character. It seems that they then tweaked the model and added options to modify it using mods. So in a way, this is like Take-Two Interactive’s lawyers DMCAing their own content. It’s an odd situation, but not surprising, <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">as in the past, Take-Two has used DMCA requests</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-interactive-removes-more-gta-mods-using-dmca-s-1848053219">yank down mods they don’t approve of in other games</a>, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-goes-on-another-grand-theft-auto-mod-killing-s-1847467984"><em>Grand Theft Auto V. </em></a></p> <p>Perhaps using the <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s own pre-existing nude model is the problem, as it is content owned by Take-Two being used in a way they likely don’t approve of. I wonder, had the modder had just replaced the don’s daughter with a nude Shrek or Thanos, if Take-Two lawyers would have shown up at all.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to get plenty of attention, and with the launch of a new limited-time game mode, several balance changes have also been made.</p>



<p>Now deep into Season 3.5, players will be forgiven for starting to look ahead to Season 4 and wondering what’s in store, but the launch of Klyntar’s Resource Rumble mode should keep you busy for the time being.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping on top of all the balance changes, however, so you’re familiar with all the buffs and nerfs. We’ve got all the details for you here.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-august-20-buffs-amp-nerfs">All Marvel Rivals August 20 Buffs &amp; Nerfs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Buffed. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals balance changes on August 20 impact three heroes, with Blade, recently added at the start of Season 3.5, given a buff, while Human Torch and Loki receive a nerf.</strong></p>



<p>Blade has boosted Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening, boosted from 60% to 65%, while the self-healing reduction has been lowered from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Human Torch’s Flame Field damage over time has been reduced to 20/s from 25/s, with Pyro-Prison damage also reduced from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<p>In the Strategist department, Loki’s Mythical Missile damage dealt by the God of Mischief and his illusions has been reduced from 30 to 25, although healing for teammates remains unchanged.</p>



<p>All other characters in the game remain untouched, though don’t expect it to remain that way for long as the big end of season balance patch is now just a few weeks out.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-marvel-rivals-version-20250821-patch-notes">Full Marvel Rivals Version 20250821 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The full patch notes are below, as shared on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250820/41667_1254957.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-duelist">Duelist</h3>



<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>



<p>The Daywalker’s resilience just slightly leveled up. Blade’s got more staying power for those midnight brawls!</p>



<p>– Increase Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening from 60% to 65%. Reduce self-healing reduction from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Human Torch</strong></p>



<p>Johnny Storm’s heat is still on, but his flame’s been dialed back just enough for ground heroes to catch their breath!</p>



<p>– Reduce Flame Field (right-click on terrain) Damage Over Time from 25/s to 20/s.</p>



<p>– Reduce Pyro-Prison Damage Over Time from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<h3 id="h-strategist">Strategist</h3>



<p><strong>Loki</strong></p>



<p>The God of Mischief and his illusions are a tad less punishing!</p>



<p>– Reduce Mystical Missile damage dealt by Loki and his illusions to enemies from 30 to 25. (Healing for teammates remains unchanged.)</p>

<p>Skate made an appearance during the Future Games Show at Gamescom, with the big announcement being a tease for a major update next week as Early Access looms.</p>



<p>The EA title, relaunching the franchise after a 15-year hiatus, has been in Closed Alpha stage for months, but with the end of the summer looming large, big news is seemingly on the horizon.</p>



<p>In a developer interview shown at Future Games Show, details were shared about development, including the in-depth parkour features, with a sign-off to keep eyes peeled for a big announcement next week.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-poised-for-big-update-ahead-of-early-access">Skate Poised For Big Update Ahead of Early Access</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Early Access is coming. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The comments at Future Games Show align with a recent <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1957843556678136288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) directed to Skate Insiders, informing them that maintenance will take place from today, August 20, until August 26, leaving the game inaccessible.</p>



<p>With Summer 2025 stated as the release for Early Access, and just a few weeks left until we tick into September and leave the Summer behind, next week’s big update could well be the launch into Early Access.</p>



<p>Skate will be released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC, though it’s not clear yet whether the title will eventually make its way onto Nintendo Switch 2, nor do we know when a full launch will be.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on Skate’s social media channels for the big announcement next week, which we’ll also cover here at Insider Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Expression Games and Team 17 have announced a follow up to the 2021 WW2 multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a>, with this new game taking us to an altogether different war. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be set during the Vietnam War, which took place between 1965 to 1973, moving players from the battlefields of Europe to the jungle terrain of the South East Asian nation.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzYzYNVWZ_A</p>


<p>When Hell Let Loose: Vietnam launches it will feature six different maps where teams of 50 will face off against each other to fight for victory and, much like the original, communication between players will be essential to getting the advantage. The Vietnam War was fought in entirely different ways to WW2, and that means there are new additions coming to in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>
<p>These additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>
<p>A release date for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is to be confirmed, but it will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Expression Games has also confirmed that the original Hell Let Loose will continue to get support and updates too.</p>

<p>Given just how persistent the calls are for Battlefield to return to a Vietnam War setting, this is bound to be a popular announcement. We’ll have a preview of the game shortly.</p>

<p>In our Hell Let Loose review, I wrote, <em>“Hell Let Loose could become a real hit amongst those looking for a bit more of a grounded experience than Call of Duty or Battlefield. However, the experience will rely heavily on the community engaging with each other positively to put plans together and make the experience authentic. Hell Let Loose is a game about teamwork and without it the chaos of war will overwhelm a player.”</em></p>

			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is a new title from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-developers-showcase-new-pvpve-extraction-shooter-hunger-in-first-gameplay-trailer/">Hell Let Loose</a> developers Expression Games and publisher Team17, bringing the tactical gameplay of Hell Let Loose and the massive 50v50 battles to "<em>a war with no front lines</em>."</p>



<p>Announced during the Future Games Show today, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026, as a specific release date wasn't announced. It builds on the original set in World War II with its signature strategy-focused gameplay, where you won't be able to win any battle on your own, and you'll need to communicate as best you can with the rest of your squad if you hope to stand a chance at victory.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam takes place during the Vietnam War from 1965-1973, and throws players into the country's jungles across six maps, and it introduces a new category of troops with aerial helicopter support troops, and the use of patrol boats. You'll also be able to take the fighting into the tunnels and construct them while playing as North Vietnamese soldiers.</p>



<p>Even with Hell Let Loose: Vietnam coming next year, Expression Games is clear that it will continue to be developed alongside new content for the original Hell Let Loose, according to a press release for today's announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Squanch Games just debuted a new 42-minute gameplay demo for High on Life 2, the sequel to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/high-on-life-review/">comedy-driven first-person-shooter from 2022</a>, but more significantly for fans looking forward to the sequel, is that we also got an official release date announced, with High on Life 2 confirmed to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>February 13, 2026.</strong> It'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>



<p>Set five years after the events of the first game, High on Life 2 begins by charging you with killing a senator that the game swears is evil, who wants to turn humans into pills with his pharmaceutical company, and get even richer than he already is. As a human yourself, you (presumably) don't want that to happen, and so begins this new adventure. Simple enough, right?</p>



<p>Or at least that would be the case, if the real driving force behind the narrative wasn't the fact that there's a larger conspiracy in which you have been sent a bounty to go after your own sister, and the successful life you've been building as a bounty hunter gets thrown for a new chaotic loop as you unravel the mystery behind the latest threat to you and the rest of humanity. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="42 MINUTES OF HIGH ON LIFE 2 GAMEPLAY!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m__l_bB13UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One of the more significant changes in the sequel that the gameplay demo showcases is how the skateboard your character rides on has taken over the game's main movement systems. There will also be new weapons introduced, and new areas to explore as the game is set on a planet called ConCon that seems to be made up of a bunch of floating conventions.</p>



<p>It definitely looks like Squanch Games has ramped up the budget this time around, as well as every other aspect of the game. But we'll have to wait and see if it all sticks the landing, and if this sequel can actually deliver on a solid gameplay experience instead of just delivering a bunch of jokes like the first game, and your mileage may vary as to whether you even liked the humor in the original. </p>

            <p>I drop the house into the great maw (not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-sword-surfing-creature-collecting-and-a-big-old-bucket-of-gamescom">that one</a>). It screams as it falls away from the clutches of my mouse clicker. It disappears from view, but there's a sickeningly wet crunching that betrays its fate. Oh and the fact that the entity's jaws immediately flare open once more, teeth and tongue dripping with anguish to cram vegetation, trees, towerblocks into its gullet.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">In Full Bloom</a>, a game that scores the full 10/10 in the wonderfully ironic naming category. Set in a greyscale universe sucked free of all hope and colour, it tasks you with accomplishing an impossible task. You've got to keep the infernal child of constant consumption happy by tossing an unending stream of junk into its mouth. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The demo I've just played for it has been out for a little while on <a href="https://obleakgames.itch.io/in-full-bloom">Itch.io</a>, while the Steam page foretelling a full release in 2026 went up a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magsch-no.bsky.social/post/3lrnffpb6zk2o">couple of months ago</a>. The thing that led me to In Full Bloom today, of all days, was <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1958116759858250029">one tweet</a> in a thread, which featured a picture of Swiss studio Obleak Games' patch of Gamescom. I saw the giant mouth perched atop a dark planet, and decided this was a thing I had to play.</p>
<p>I'm glad I did. In Full Bloom's described as a Katamari-like, and the truth is that it's exactly what would happen if the folks who do Katamari were like 'Right, how can we take everything that doesn't make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end in this game, and flip it so that's a feeling so overwhelming you won't be able to forget it'. To put it another way, the game's like jumping into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC91V6D3nkhP89wUb9f_h17g">MeatCanyon</a> video about ASMR. Being not just present among the skin-crawling proceedings, but winding the crank that powers their descent into even more horrific depths.</p><p>Ok, I might be being a bit dramatic, but if you dislike the sound of people eating, this isn't the game for you. The demo has three stages - small mouth, big mouth, and bigger mouth. You start off with the first, feeding it detritus and colourless veg from a garden as it grows with each gulp. The entity's young at this point, so it makes panicked baby squeals and gurgles amid the slurping and swallowing of its three-toothed maw. I think they get more intense if you stop shovelling food in, but honestly they made me so uncomfortable that I couldn't entertain slowing down to find out.</p>

<p>Big mouth's grown up, so it has a full set of human gnashers and can gradually work its way up to chowing down a full cul-de-sac. Fences, trees, screaming houses. There's also a bus doing merry laps around the creature - you can have your weird son try to catch it by pointing with the mouse, but I didn't manage it. The lethargy of this movement, while saving In Full Bloom from being a fully static experience and undeniably fitting with the rest of its atmoshere, does mean there's nothing akin to the frenetic rolling that gives good universe Katamari its upbeat tempo and fuels a lot of the fun.</p>
<p>The sense of satisfaction you get from plucking up increasingly ludicrous amounts and sizes of object is still there, but that sense of satisfaction has become terrifying, as you sacrifice moons to a continent-proportioned pit of despair.</p>

<p>The demo will need a lot of the fleshing out before it's a game I can see myself playing for more than one sitting. It's carried a lot by the novelty of the weirdness. As of right now, it's a top class metaphor for the mechanisms of capital, always desperate for <strong>more</strong>, demanding constant and unsustainable growth because as the game's description says, "there is only one way".</p><p>I reckon it's more universal than just that, though. It might be because the experience is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">fresh in my mind</a>, but I spent my time with it being reminded of how helping cover the biggest game showcases has often left me feeling so far in my career. I like video games, but when they're being fired at you one after the other, in a barrage of double digit minutes or hours, they tend to just blend into an overwhelming soup of lights, faces, rambling voices, bangs, booms, instrumental swells, platforms, release dates, jangling Keighs.</p>
<p>By the time your eyes have adjusted to try and take in one, the next has already arrived, like scoops of ice cream being fired from a machine gun. In the rush of the moment, the job's to be a speedy vessel of information, from the stream to the virtual page. Ice Cream. Vanilla. Travelling at 50mph. Could have been double scoop if £50.99 deluxe edition was bought. Publish.</p>
<p>There's a great skill to it, and even more of a skill to being able to take all of this in and occasionally give some useful commentary, like 'the consistency of that mint scoop as it flies by may hint at chocolate chips, which would be an improvement from the last one, the chiplessness of which I and many long-time fans disliked'. As with folks watching at home, there's a thrill to just seeing which games pop up, but the adrenaline rush is tied to a love of the scramble.</p>
<p>There may well be a day when this work feels more like classic Katamari rolling to me, but for now it's more like feeding In Full Bloom's great gob. Speaking of which, oh god, I think it's hungry again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>More price hikes are coming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">thanks to President Trump’s tariffs</a>. Diapers, toothpaste, cars, it’s all about to get <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/20/trump-tariffs-car-prices">more expensive</a>. Families are projected to collectively <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/tariffs/tariffs-bring-massive-new-taxes-on-food-apparel-back-to-school-items">pay millions</a> more for back-to-school supplies and $2 billion extra on new clothes. Home Depot <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/economy/home-depot-tariffs-prices">just warned</a> home repairs and renovations will get pricier too. In gaming, the latest wave of trade-war-fueled inflation is already here. The average console is now anywhere from $30 to $100 more expensive than it was a year ago. Trump’s tariffs are a lot of things—<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">random, chaotic, nonsensical</a>. They are also secretly a massive tax on playing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>.</p> <p>Rockstar Games’ next blockbuster is expected to help sell millions of new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, the only hardware you’ll be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-take-two-ceo-price-80-ps5-2000616607">play <em>GTA 6</em> on when it arrives next May</a>. It’s the kind of release that gets people who have been holding out on upgrading or who dropped out of gaming altogether to walk into a GameStop or Walmart and pick up a new console. And doing so will now cost an additional 20-35 percent, more than the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/value-added-tax-vat-rates-europe/">highest sales tax in Europe</a>. And console pricing could get even worse. Who’s ready for Nintendo to announce a Switch 2 OLED in 2027 that starts at $600?</p> <p>Microsoft was <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">the first to pull the trigger</a> on responding to Trump’s trade war with price increases. In May, the Xbox Series S went from $300 to $370 and the Xbox Series X went from $500 to $600. Controllers and headsets also got more expensive. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">Nintendo followed suit earlier this month</a>, holding the line on the $450 price tag of its new Switch 2 but bumping the older models up by $50, with accessories getting multiple rounds of price hikes. Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">has now thrown up its hands, too</a>. Having already raised the disc-less PS5 to $450 with the Slim redesign, it’s going to be $500 starting August 21, with the other versions, including the Pro, going up by $50 as well.</p>

 <p>“Even though Sony is diversifying away from China (for US bound shipments), it’s still an important manufacturing center for Sony. 30% tariff on China, 15% tariff on Japan, 20% tariff on Vietnam, 19% tariff on Malaysia means Sony is impacted no matter what,” <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1958185512075690196">wrote</a> Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad on X. “I was expecting a $50 price increase because Sony has been proactive in adapting in the wake of tariffs. Xbox’s price increase being slightly higher is because of the increased dependence on China (higher tariff).” He notes that prices could still go up again depending on whatever Trump decides to do next.</p> <p>When <em>GTA 5</em> launched in 2013, a new Xbox 360 was as cheap as $200, and a new PS3 was just $250. In today’s dollars, they would still only cost $280 and $350, respectively. Trump’s tariffs are far from the only reason console prices have gone way up, but they’ve certainly made an existing trend way worse in the U.S. Trade groups <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">warned of billions</a> being sapped out of the video game industry if Trump went ahead with his most draconian tariffs. We’re not even in that worst-case scenario, and things already suck.</p> <p>None of this should be that surprising. Trump has been promising new tariffs for years. He campaigned on it. He got elected. He is doing it. And now we are stuck with the bill. The president has been promising for months to bargain his way out of dropping poll numbers and a possible economic recession by winning better trade deals and ushering in a new golden age of American manufacturing. So far, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing-resurgence-jobs">it hasn’t worked</a>. It reminds me of lobbing a banana at the racers ahead of you in <em>Mario Kart,</em> only to miss them and end up driving over it yourself.&nbsp;Call it the art of the peel. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/06/tariffs-yes-we-have-more-expensive-bananas/">Those</a> are getting more expensive, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam has just been unveiled by Team17 and Expression Games. In a follow-up to 2021’s Hell Let Loose, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam welcomes players to one of the most brutal and notorious conflicts of the 20th century, plunging them into 50v50 battles in the jungles of Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will debut with six sprawling maps and will feature land, sea, and air combat.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-jungle">Welcome to the Jungle</h2>



<p>Vietnam was a harrowing war, but it makes for a fantastic theatre for video games. Historically, we’ve seen plenty of games pop up that have used the Vietnam War as a key setting, from Black Ops to Shellshock, and from Conflict to Battlefield.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the next take on the gruesome war that took the lives of millions of people between the 1960s and 1970s.</p>



<p>In a press release, Team17 and Expression Games revealed what players can expect in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set during the Vietnam War, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam offers existing and new fans a high caliber gameplay experience of authentic warfare where teamwork is the key to success. Experience 50v50 player battles across stunning, sprawling maps with careful attention aimed at creating an authentic, atmospheric and historically sensitive experience of events that occurred during armed conflict that occurred in Vietnam, between 1965-1973. </p>



<p>Retaining the gameplay base that fans loved from the first title, this is a brand new experience, utilising combined arms, with air, water, armour, infantry and support weapons that encapsulates the theatre of war feeling beloved by fans of the original title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players will be using helicopters to deploy troops on the battlefield and deliver fire support to squads pinned down by enemy fire. Patrol boats will strafe the shore, while Vietnam’s NVA forces will use tunnels and jungle warfare tactics to dynamically ambush enemies.#</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest trailer shows more combat and open-world exploration.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world action RPG The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin released a new trailer as part of gamescom’s Opening Night Live on Tuesday and also announced that sign-ups are open now for an upcoming <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">closed beta test</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presented by Netmarble, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin tells an original story set in Britannia, the same world as the globally popular The Seven Deadly Sins anime and manga series. The art style is also inspired by those series, and the game’s multiverse narrative will transcend timelines and dimensions to combine brand-new characters with established heroes from throughout the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest trailer continues a trend of releasing new footage at major game shows this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-action-rpg-the-seven-deadly-sins-origin-unveils-two-new-trailers?_gl=1*1i895aq*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTY3MDY1MTM0MC4xNzU0MDc1NTYw*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTQwNzU1NTkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQwNzU1NTkkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>Two new trailers</u></a> released back-to-back at Summer Game Fest and the Future Games Show in June, and now the gamescom trailer (which you can watch above) shows some brand-new footage and gives us a look at combat and exploration. The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is also scheduled to be showcased at Tokyo Game Show in September, and its presence at all these major game shows is steadily building momentum and anticipation of a release later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Narrated by the Japanese voice actor of Meliodas, one of the series’ lead characters, the new trailer begins by giving us a glimpse of its vast open world from atop a cliff. We then see a series of short clips of characters that fans of the series will recognize before transitioning to exploration of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s fishing and then the main character Tristan inserts blocks into a small monument and is rewarded with the appearance of a treasure chest. So it seems like the open world will have scattered environmental puzzles to solve and earn rewards.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/environmental-puzzle-1754502772701.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, there’s a look at traversal methods. A character jumps onto a spinning flower and rides its updraft of wind into the air before summoning a flying mount, and then we see the full party exploring a desert region on the backs of other flying mounts. So you won’t have to hoof it across Britannia all the time; that’s a relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the trailer is essentially a supercut of several different characters in flashy, fast-paced combat against some wild-looking enemies. The combat showcase includes switching between characters to combo their attacks together, along with multiple different elements being used — lightning, fire, and ice all make an appearance. The trailer ends with 10 characters running toward the horizon together, giving us a taste of the large cast that will be available.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/huge-monster-1754502995894.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the trailer, Netmarble announced that they’re now accepting sign-ups for an upcoming closed beta test that will give fans a preview of gameplay mechanics, character interactions, and environments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can sign up on the game’s <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">official website</a>, and everyone is eligible.

        <p>Now, Streumon returns to its independent roots as developer and publisher of <em>Daimon Blades</em>, following a strategic move to reacquire full ownership of the studio in an era dominated by acquisitions and mergers. This renewed independence reflects the team’s deep commitment to creative control and quality. With Daimon Blades, Streumon is forging a bold new cooperative slasher, shaped by experience and driven by uncompromised vision.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p><em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> is a story-driven survival strategy game in which the fate of the iconic starship is in your hands. Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?</p><p><strong>“What if?” Scenarios</strong></p><p>Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently? If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?</p><p>Wonder no more: <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> allows players to take control and shape the journey of the U.S.S. Voyager as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s! The game features <a title="Genres > Roguelike [355 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.</p><p><strong>Deep Ship <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a> and Research</strong></p><p>After being moved forcefully into the Delta Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager ends up heavily damaged and in dire need of repairs as well as internal reconstruction. Restore destroyed rooms, secure life support and energy supplies, and start constructing. Ship systems, crew quarters, industrial and research facilities: You must decide what to build and when, to ensure the ship has what it needs for the perilous journey.</p><p>Expedite research into different fields. New technologies and improved layouts will not only strengthen the ship but also boost your crew’s morale. Exotic and dangerous research, like the technology of the Borg, is also within your reach. As captain, will you embrace it for the potential it offers, or will you omit it for the dangers it presents?</p><p><strong>Exploration and Resource Acquisition</strong></p><p>The dangers and opportunities of the Delta Quadrant beckon to be discovered by you and your crew. Scan celestial bodies to locate precious resources that fuel your journey. Find points of interest and oddities along your way, but beware: While the Delta Quadrant may reward the bold, it punishes the careless just as quickly. As captain, you have the final say in plotting a course and defining an approach.</p><p><strong>Ship Combat and Away Missions</strong></p><p>The journey of the U.S.S. Voyager would not be possible without both combat between ships and away missions to planets or space facilities.</p><p>For away missions, put together a team based on the individual talents of your crew. A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots. Minimize the risk for the team’s members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach—you decide.</p><p>When diplomacy fails, the U.S.S. Voyager and its crew are ready to enter ship combat at your command. From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry. And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>“What if?” Scenario and Storytelling</strong> – The ultimate platform to play out your course of action during the iconic journey of the U.S.S. Voyager.</li><li><strong>Complex Ship Management</strong> – Repair, construct, and maintain an efficient and habitable ship to ensure systems and crew operate effectively.</li><li><strong>Exploration and Decision Making</strong> – The Delta Quadrant is a fascinating yet perilous place that awaits exploration and demands decisive action.</li><li><strong>Combat and Away Missions</strong> – Use the talents of your crew smartly to minimize risk during away missions as well as strike boldly during ship combat encounters.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced Surviving Mars Relaunched, an expanded version of 2018’s Surviving Mars. This relaunch version will include the base game, all of the original DLCs, including content packs and radio stations. Paradox has also confirmed that those with the original release will have an upgrade pathway, but the original version of Surviving Mars will be removed from sale on all platforms when Relaunched is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Surviving Mars Relaunched | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTU0f4tlg5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Surviving Mars: Relaunched is not just going to be a repackage of Surviving Mars, with this release including user interface improvements as well as new content. That new content is called Martian Assembly, something not available in the original release, where a dynamic political system will be added. In the Martian Assembly, you will pass laws to balance the needs and wants of the colonists including domestic matters to full Martian independence.</p>
<p>If you own Surviving Mars and want to upgrade to Surviving Mars Relaunched, you will get a discount. Paradox has said, <em>” An automatic discount of $20 on the standard price $39.99 (discounted price $19.99) will be applied to your purchase of the base game Surviving Mars: Relaunched if the original Surviving Mars is already in your library. The discount will only be applied if you are purchasing it on the same platform and using the same account as your original purchase. The offer cannot be applied across platforms.”</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/15/surviving-mars-review/">Surviving Mars Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Surviving Mars review, Stefan wrote, <em>“If we ever try to colonise our red neighbour, it’s going to be one of the greatest challenges that mankind will ever undertake. Though Surviving Mars makes a game out of it, Haemimont have brilliantly kept that hard edge, as it constantly pushes and tests your ability to plan with survival in mind, especially with the unpredictability of the Mysteries of Mars. There’s plenty of ways to improve it and put more colony control in the hands of the player, but the first landing is already off to a great start.”</em></p>

              <p><span>Catch me redownloading </span><i><span>Guilty Gear Strive</span></i><span>, as Lucy from the excellent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-netflix-studio-trigger-1851785703"><i><span>Cyberpunk Edgerunners </span></i></a><span>anime is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248"><span>joining the roster as a guest character</span></a><span>. Arc System Works’ anime fighter is releasing its </span><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/#p21"><span>1.48 patch tomorrow</span></a><span>, August 21, and not only will it come with the usual balance changes and bug fixes, but it will also bring more </span><i><span>Cyberpunk</span></i><span> content to the game as well. However, there is one downer in the small print.</span></p> <p><span>Lucy is the only </span><i><span>Edgerunners </span></i><span>character joining the roster, but there will be references to others in the 1.48 patch, with avatars based on Lucy, David, and Rebecca from </span><i><span>Edgerunners</span></i><span> being made available. Meanwhile, in one of the crossover’s coolest touches, a selection of tracks from </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>‘s soundtrack will be available as background music for all your fights, regardless of whether or not you’ve paid to play as Lucy. This includes songs by Johnny Silverhand’s band Samurai, such as the lesser version of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq3d6XA75Y"><span>“Chippin’ In”</span></a><span> (should’ve been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ud65jWxMJg"><span>the superior take by my trashbag boyfriend Kerry Eurodyne</span></a><span>), as well as </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN1RJF55NXI"><span>“Never Fade Away.”</span></a><span> The best song on the list, however, is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMY1uzSC1E"><span>“I Really Want to Stay at Your House” by Rosa Walton</span></a><span>, arguably the most iconic song from the game and anime. The song accompanies some of </span><i><span>Edgerunners’ </span></i><span>best moments, and is used to incredible effect. So if you want to have yearning pop perfection playing in the background as you climb up the ranks, you can do that…but only for a limited time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>According to the patch notes, “I Really Want to Stay at Your House” will be removed from </span><i><span>Strive </span></i><span>in 2027, and that’s as specific as the notes get. The specific end date will be “announced separately,” and “may be moved up without prior notice.” Bummer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p><em>Project Bloomwalker</em> is an all-new cozy crafting adventure game.</p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting a vision of a world where the protagonist’s footsteps bring life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal that transforms the world around them. Aboard their moving house, players and their adorable spirt companions called Oddling embark on a journey to explore uncharted territories, cleanse tainted landscapes, gather resources for crafting and decoration, and forge bonds with their Oddling friends as they prepare for new adventures.</p><p>Set in a once-beautiful land shared by humans and mysterious spirits, the game begins when a mysterious meteor crashes down that leaves an impact site so polluted that no life can survive. As the world suffers, Bloomwalkers appear who can wield power to restore life and heal the wounded earth. Taking on the role of a Bloomwalker, players will journey forth in their unique moving house to cleanse the polluted landscapes and rekindle the harmony of nature.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The difference between <em>Project Bloomwalker</em> and other <a title="Genres > Crafting [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting games</a> is its moving house system. Instead of being tied down due to a misplaced base, players experience true nomadic freedom with their own mobile house. They can effortlessly relocate, uncover breathtaking landscapes and transform any location into their personal sanctuary that embraces the joy of a life on the move.</p><p><strong>■ Game Overview</strong></p><p><strong>How would you describe <em>Bloomwalker</em> in one sentence?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> is a cozy interactive experience that lets players embark on a cozy crafting journey aboard a traveling house while befriending Oddlings, cleansing a tainted land and creating their perfect sanctuary.</p><p><strong>What is the core concept, and what kind of experience can players expect?</strong></p><p>We aim to evoke the joy of healing and restoration in <em>Bloomwalker</em>. This isn’t a game of combat, but of caring and reviving a world in need. Players will purify a wounded land and build a family amidst solitude, experiencing heartfelt connections and emotional resonance throughout this moving journey.</p><p><strong>What does the title <em>Bloomwalker</em> mean?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting our vision of a world where your mobile house brings life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal, transforming the world around them.</p><p><strong>You describe the game as “emotional crafting”-how does that differ from traditional <a title="Genres > Survival [445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> crafting games?</strong></p><p>While traditional crafting games often revolve around survival, <em>Bloomwalker</em> offers a different experience, emphasizing “us and the world” through emotional crafting. Instead of the constant struggle to survive, we provide the joy of creating beauty, healing nature, and building meaningful relationships. With its rich themes of environment and emotion, we hope to invite more players to experience the unique and rewarding essence of the crafting genre.</p><p><strong>■ Gameplay and Systems</strong></p><p><strong>What do players primarily do in the game?</strong></p><p>There are four core activities in <em>Bloomwalker</em>:</p><ul><li>Explore unknown lands aboard your moving house.</li><li>Purify polluted nature.</li><li>Craft and decorate using gathered resources.</li><li>Connect with the Oddlings as you prepare for your next journey.</li></ul><p>You’ll also face challenges, including mysterious threats like the “Pelicanny.”</p><p>The game will support <a title="Genres > Co-Op [316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, so players can explore and decorate their traveling home with friends.</p><p><strong>Why did you decide to make the house move?</strong></p><p>We encourage players to explore freely, without the fear of making mistakes. Unlike many crafting games where the base location is a stressful choice, we’ve removed that burden. Your house is a nomadic companion, allowing you to pack up and move to any landscape, transforming it into your next camp and home.</p><p><strong>I wanted to control the house myself, but I couldn’t. Is it not controllable? Can I customize or upgrade it? What’s the “Magic Door”?</strong></p><p>Yes! Full movement control is a key feature of the full game. The demo’s automated path was simply for showcasing the core appeal in a short time. And yes, you can unleash your creativity and decorate your house as you wish. We use a ‘Magic Door’ system to expand the interior space without changing the exterior, allowing you to design your own limitless and unique worlds.</p><p><strong>The Oddlings are adorable. Who are they?</strong></p><p>Oddlings are fairy-like companions you meet in the polluted world and, in turn, are your chosen family. We hope their presence brings the warmth of a “big, bustling family,” sharing daily life together. You’ll wake up, cook, play, and tuck each other in at night which is the kind of heartwarming routine that brings a smile to your face, and it’s all part of the game.</p><p><strong>The black cat inside the house was memorable. Who is it?</strong></p><p>Drawing inspiration from beloved fairy tales like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the cat is a mysterious character who lives in the moving house and joins you on your quest to purify the world. It holds a secret… but we wouldn’t want to reveal too much! :)</p><p><strong>The missions seemed quite structured—does that mean the game has low freedom for a crafting game?</strong></p><p>The demo was designed to be a guided tour, highlighting the core features in a limited timeframe. In the full version, you’ll be able to explore freely, choosing your own objectives, solving environmental puzzles, and discovering hidden materials and secrets throughout the world.</p><p><strong>■ Art, Story, and Atmosphere</strong></p><p><strong>The art style is stunning. What inspired this direction?</strong></p><p>Our vision was to immerse players in a living, breathing world reminiscent of a stunning animated film. The art team’s primary focus was to ensure every visual element felt alive, employing gentle yet vibrant color contrasts to emphasize the powerful transition from decay to flourishing life.</p><p><strong>What’s the overall story and worldbuilding like?</strong></p><p>Humans and spirits once shared a flourishing world, until a meteor brought ruin. The impact zone became a source of corruption, spreading decay across the land. In response, individuals called the Bloomwalkers with the ability to heal the environment began to emerge. Their presence brings life back to blighted areas. Players will take on the role of a Bloomwalker, traveling the land in their Moving House of Restoration, seeking to undo the damage.</p><p><strong>■ Development History</strong></p><p><strong>What games inspired <em>Bloomwalker</em>?</strong></p><p>The crafting genre is filled with excellent games that have captivated players and sparked creativity. <em>Bloomwalker</em>, however, seeks to redefine the experience by introducing elements of heartfelt warmth, animation-inspired emotion, and a profound sense of harmony with the natural world. Instead of drawing inspiration from particular games, we chose to build upon the genre’s foundations while injecting our own unique emotional narrative.</p><p><strong>Why choose the environment as a central theme?</strong></p><p>Our philosophy is that games have the power to offer a warm and reflective perspective on life. <em>Bloomwalker</em> isn’t about delivering a complex message; instead, we aspire to evoke a subtle emotion in each player: the urge to protect the beauty that surrounds them. Our hope is that the game can encourage players to embrace a more positive outlook on the world.</p><p><strong>■ Other Details</strong></p><p><strong>When will the game be released, and on what platforms?</strong></p><p>We will share more details on the launch schedule through various channels.</p><p>It may take a while, but we believe it’s the time needed to fully realize the living, breathing world we envision.</p><p>The game made its debut at Gamescom, and we’re committed to making it a lasting, memorable experience.</p><p>Platforms? We’re preparing a broad launch. You’ll find <em>Bloomwalker</em> on <a title="Platforms > Xbox [26,484 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, including Game Pass, and various platforms across console and PC.</p><p><strong>Why did you debut at Gamescom? Are you targeting the European market?</strong></p><p>Gamescom brings together some of the most passionate gamers in the world, making it the perfect place to share our new journey. We also believe that European players—many of whom deeply value environmental themes—will resonate strongly with our message of restoration and renewal.</p><p><strong>What about language support?</strong></p><p>The demo is currently in English, but the full game will support a wide range of languages, which is in line with what’s standard for console releases.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/netmarble-announces-cozy-crafting-adventure-game-project-bloomwalker-for-xbox-series-pc-and-more]]></content:encoded>
