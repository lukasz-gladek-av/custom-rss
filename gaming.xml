            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="35655e5426fe6"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35655e5426fe6/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>While the Switch and Switch 2 are portable systems that come with their own built-in screens, I've often been drawn to pairing Nintendo's hybrid consoles with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch">portable monitors</a> when I'm on the road and away from my TV.</p>
<p>One of my favourite choices for the original Switch is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#the-premium-choice-espressodisplay-v2">Espresso V2</a>, a premium 1080p screen which doesn't even need the dock – you can connect the console via a USB-C cable and power the screen using another USB-C-based power brick.</p>
<p>You can imagine, then, how excited I was when Espresso Displays offered to send out the 4K version of their screen to test with the Switch 2. <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-pro?variant=47210169860328">The £650 Espresso Pro 15</a> boasts a 15.6-inch, 60Hz LCD panel capable of displaying 1.07 billion colours and weighs 800 grams. With its anodised aluminium casing and super-tough glass front, it's the kind of screen I can see myself taking on the road with me – but there's one big drawback.</p>

<p>It seems that Nintendo has changed the way the Switch 2 outputs video through its USB-C ports, so you need the dock to run it on external displays like this – and that means using Espresso's own HDMI-to-USB-C cable, <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/hdmi?variant=46000850272488">which comes at an extra cost of £60</a>.</p>
<p>Even then, there are issues. Espesso's aforementioned cable has an extra USB-A cable built in for additional power to turn on the screen, but this cable isn't physically long enough to reach the USB-C port on the Switch 2 dock.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to place the dock next to a wall socket so I could plug in a USB power brick to juice up the screen. Alas, even this isn't enough to bring the display to life, so <em>another</em> USB-C power supply was required, plugged directly into the Espresso Pro 15's second USB-C port.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Espresso V2 required a similar setup (both of its USB-C ports were occupied), but the need to use the dock and an extra power supply for the HDMI cable is somewhat inconvenient.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the fact that the Espresso Pro 15 isn't using an OLED panel is a disappointment, as the difference is definitely noticeable; while the LCD screen seen here is bright, it lacks the punch of other displays I've used, such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#when-1080p-just-doesnt-cut-it-innocn-pu15-pre-15-6-4k-oled-monitor">INNOCN PU15-PRE</a> (which is also 4K).</p>
<figure data-uuid="f56ae2becb514"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f56ae2becb514/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a shame, because the bundled <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-stand-plus?variant=46757226938600">Espresso Stand+</a> makes this even more appealing for gamers. Using powerful neodymium magnets, the screen bolts onto the stand with ease, and even allows you to spin the display 90 degrees for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tate-mode-nintendo-switch-games">TATE-mode shmup action</a>. The Stand+ is adjustable and comes with two height settings, making it quite versatile.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that I used the Espresso Pro 15 from a gamer's point of view. However, its maker describes it as a screen aimed at professionals, and it's certainly more successful when viewed from that perspective. It can be powered using a single USB-C cable, which also connects to your Mac or PC and turns it into a second display, complete with touch support. That's a far more elegant solution than having to use a dock and two power supplies, as is the case when playing on it with a Switch 2.</p>
<p>With its lofty price tag and dependence on an additional extra in the shape of a specialised HDMI cable, it's hard to recommend the Espresso Pro 15 if you're <em>solely</em> looking for a portable gaming screen to use with your Switch 2 – but if you in the market for one that can double as a work monitor <em>and</em> a gaming one, then it might be worth a look.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Total War: Medieval III Is in Early Development; Warcore Engine Announced]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/</link>
            <guid>1373269</guid>

			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLDUmptln8&amp;pp=2AYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase</a> dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the franchise, Creative Assembly announced that Total War: Medieval III is now in early development.</p>



<p>In the official announcement article, the developers position the game as a return to a grounded, systems-driven historical Total War, with a heavy focus on politics, religion, and feudal power structures, rather than just map-painting conquest and a focus on medieval Europe and its neighboring regions, rather than a globe-spanning map. </p>



<p>The game is being developed with the next-generation Warcore engine, an evolution of the Total War engine intended to power future titles and support both PC and consoles. The team confirmed plans to bring Total War experiences to PlayStation and Xbox using this technology, while emphasizing that high-end PC strategy remains the priority and that the series will stay at the forefront of large-scale battles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Total War: Medieval III was undoubtedly the showcase's highlight, there was plenty more, starting with the availability of the premium <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER III</a> DLC Tides of Torment, which adds three new Legendary Lords to the High Elves, Norsca, and Slaanesh races. Furthermore, the stream unveiled the upcoming Lords of The End Times Pack, which will unleash four new Legendary Lords into the colossal Immortal Empires campaign (which, by the way, is now available for free to <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-review-monsters-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER I</a> &amp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-ii-its-bloody-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER II</a> players) experience in Summer 2026. The first to be revealed is none other than the great necromancer, Nagash, who returns to reclaim his lost power and drown the world in undeath.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>These new lords also herald the arrival of the free End Times Update. Drawing inspiration from the lore, players will embark on a campaign experience transformed, featuring apocalyptic scenarios and cataclysmic events that push the boundaries of strategy and survival. And to crown this update, a new Legendary Lord will rise, ready to leave their mark on the cataclysm to come.</p>



<p>Today's announcements aren't everything. There's an unannounced Total War project that will be fully revealed at The Game Awards in a week from today. Creative Assembly described this as the next major release in one of the most ambitious games in Total War's entire history, framing it as the start of the franchise's exciting new era.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a> is in early pre-production, Creative Assembly have revealed during Total War's 25th anniversary showcase, with release still years away. It's to be the "rebirth of historical Total War", and CA are unveiling it earlier than they've ever announced a Total War game before, so that you crafty peasants can offer more feedback throughout development.</p>
<p>Time to hang up your Reikland Runefang and start boning up on the fall of the Byzantines - though there's precious little news about how the new Twar will differ in practice from Medieval 2, which launched way back in 2006. Here's a live action trailer full of moody-looking regents, some of whom are badly in need of a sticking plaster.

<p>
During the showcase stream, there was much loose historical background and talk of reinventing the wheel (which may have happened several times during the medieval era - enlighten me, historians?) but few concrete specifics. They don't even have a fixed start date for the period, though it sounds like it'll be approximately 12th to 15th century.</p><p>If I'm reading the entrails correctly, the game's world will range from the Holy Roman Empire through the Kingdom of England to the Italian Free States, the Mongols and the Ottomans. It will feature such celebs as Saladin, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and Richard the Lionheart.
</p>
<p>
The devs characterised the medieval period as one of experimentation, personal ambition, and the formation of nations. There was an aside on "lines of succession", which suggests you might be switching between rulers and their heirs, but colour that speculation. There was also a bit of detail on recruitment and historical armies, with a senior game designer commenting that rather than having a standing army, you might call on oaths of fealty to rally the banners of your vassals. 
</p>
<p>As divulged on <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii">the official website</a>, Medieval 3 will run on Warcore, Creative Assembly's new engine tech. It's billed as "unlike anything we’ve worked with before, offering a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks - all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve." Given how long Creative Assembly have been working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a>, it's nice to hear that there's a more comprehensive technological overhaul in the offing. </p>
<p>
I'll be honest, Medieval is one of the Twars I skipped. I am Shogun and Three Kingdoms to the bone. Still, I'm delighted for you fans of knights and castles. If you're baying for more, please direct your baying at <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii">this announcement post</a> from Medieval 3 creative director Leif Walter. It contains a lot of blue sky thinking, but there are some possibly indicative remarks about letting players deviate from the textbooks and your realm being "really almost like the main character in an RPG game".
</p><p>
That's not all Creative Assembly announced in their showcase. Not all they teased, rather. They've got another game reveal next week, during the Geoff Awards. Apparently, "this title will be Total War's next major release and represents one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history, marking the beginning of an exciting new era." Are the words "for the Emperor" stomping with zealous indignation towards this sentence, CA?
</p>
<p>
If all of this has you classique Warhammer advocates boarding your griffins and fleeing to the mountains, come back. There's more Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC on the way - Lords of the End Times, which introduces uber-necromancer Nagash and three other legendary lords. We'll try to write about that when we can. I have to go read up on Eleanor of Aquitaine.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 goes live on Tuesday, meaning that there’s a large update for all players to download in order to get back in the game.</p>



<p>While many have been able to download the large update with no issue, there have been many others reporting issues with getting the latest content.</p>



<p>First mentioned by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1996629708621148440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, users are reporting that they are stuck in an “update available” loop. It’s not all platforms, but one that’s known to have an issue is Battle.net</p>



<p><strong>“The game is updated, but I can’t get in [because] this is the [message] I keep getting, Battlenet,”</strong> one user <a href="https://x.com/NightwolfLotus/status/1996629997608665298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Said another</a>, “<strong>Already downloaded the update yet I cannot get passed this [Black Ops 7 start screen. I’ve restarted [Battle.net] and nothing.”</strong><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272"></a></p>



<p>As of writing, Activision nor developers Treyarch and Raven Software have made any sort of public comment on the issue. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>



<p>Have you had any issues playing Black Ops 7 after downloading the Season 1 update?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime, up until this week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, at least, is mostly free of spoken dialogue — especially when it comes to its mute protagonist, Samus Aran. But an unused monologue was recorded for the original Metroid Prime, and eventually uncovered by fans, with its performer remaining unknown. Until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently sat down with legendary Mass Effect and Metal Gear Solid (among many, many others) voice actress, Jennifer Hale, who provided the voice for Samus — entirely grunts and effort sounds — in the original Metroid Prime trilogy. While we were talking with her (and before it was confirmed she had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-replaced-samus-voice-actor-for-metroid-prime-4-so-its-no-longer-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-doing-the-grunts"><u>been replaced for 2025’s Metroid Prime 4</u></a>) we thought we’d get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding who voiced that once-lost voice-over that was left on the cutting room floor. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That monologue goes as follows, for those who are unfamiliar:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“Ten years ago, below the surface of planet Zebes, the mercenaries known as Space Pirates were defeated by interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran. Descending to the very core of the Pirate stronghold, Samus exterminated the energy-based parasites called Metroids, and defeated Mother Brain, the leader of the Pirate horde. But the' Space Pirates were far from finished. Several Pirate research vessels were orbiting Zebes while Samus fought on the surface below. After the fall of Mother Brain, the ships escaped, with the hopes of finding enough resources to rebuild their forces, and take their revenge. After discovering a possible Pirate colony on planet Tallon IV, Samus has again prepared for war, hoping to end the Pirate threat forever.”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Hale being the most famous voice of Samus, you’d perhaps assume she also recorded these introductory lines to the world of Prime. Well, you’d be wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's Vanessa. Vanessa Marshall," Hale reveals. It's perhaps not a surprise, as Marshall is already credited with also lending her talents to the voice of Samus in Metroid Prime, notably contributing her death scream to the sound library. Marshall also starred alongside Hale in Marvel’s Midnight Suns, as well as Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty as Olga, and may be familiar to fans of animated TV as the voice of Hera Syndulla in Star Wars' Rebels and Bad Batch series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to why Retro Studios and Nintendo went with Marshall over Hale for this prospective monologue, only to then ditch it anyway, Hale says she's unsure. “I adore Vanessa,” Hale adds. “I love that we actually shared this role. It's so crazy, and I'm not sure why. I never remember saying no to this. I would never have said no to doing this. They may have preferred her work. I have no idea.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not getting to record these fully formed sentences, Hale did get the lion's share of the grunt work on Metroid Prime. It sounds an intriguing process, which she went on to explain in more detail:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I like to have identified a character's way of speaking before I do grunting for them, because how you grunt is different to how I grunt, to how anyone else grunts," Hale explained. "It's very specific. If you are a civilian and you're grunting, you're like... [makes surprised grunt noise] because it's all surprising and it's all new. If you've done it a million times, you're like [makes short grunt noise], because you've gone under fire 1,800 times and you're used to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that once-lost intro narration was never used in the original Metroid Prime, parts of the monologue would later see the light of day, thanks to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Jay Ward, who voiced Star Fox’s Wolf O’Donnell in the Nintendo fighting game series, rerecorded certain lines of it that were laid under the Opening/Menu - Metroid Prime track on the soundtrack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Who knows where this monologue will turn up next, or why it was never actually used in the final game. At least for now, thanks to Samus herself, part of this mystery has been solved. Would you have liked the intro narration to have been kept? Although I do love the lonely, wordless nature of Metroid Prime, I do like the “Ripley at the end of Alien” feel this gives to the game.

            <p>Three Fields Entertainment, developers of Burnout with sky roads racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckreation">Wreckreation</a>, have announced that their entire team have been put on notice of redundancy. According to the announcement from CEO and former Criterion studio director Fiona Sperry, this comes as Three Fields find themselves without backing from Wreckreation publishers THQNordic, having "had to self-fund most of this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful," Sperry wrote in a message shared via the game's Twitter account.</p>
<p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for all of us," she continued. "What makes it even harder is that we have so many things in the pipeline — multiple features, updates, and creative ideas that we were excited to bring to the game, many of which are showcased in the video we’re sharing today."</p>
<p>Said video, which you can watch via the tweet above, shows off a number of feature additions which I'll be keen to give a go if they do make it into Wreckreation. One's an "accident black spots" mode mirroring classic Burnout's brilliant crash mode, in which you're given a junction and tasked with causing as costly a pileup as possible. There's also a "tightrope mode" all about driving along very narrow airborne obstacle courses, the ability to add buildings to the map while in the game's live mix building mode, and a bunch of construction vehicles and trucks you can drive around.</p><div>

<p>Of all those, the crash mode's something I could genuinely see giving Wreckreation some bounce-back potential, assuming the likes of BeamNG.Drive haven't filled that void in many players' minds. The ability to essentially build your own towns could also go a long way to helping put a plaster on one of the game's biggest problems - its boringly barren worldspace outside of player-built sky spaghetti.</p>
<p>"My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," Sperry wrote. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team." As of writing, Three Fields still plan to deliver an update adding crossplay to Wreckreation before Christmas.</p>
<p>All the news we report about game developers losing their jobs or being at risk of that sees us send our best to the folks affected, but I'm particularly sad to see Three Fields in this tough situation. That's largely because I really enjoyed the work Sperry, Alex Ward and co did on Burnout and Need For Speed while at Criterion, with both those series either dormant or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">currently on hold</a>.</p>
<p>Both Wreckreation and 2019's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dangerous-driving">Dangerous Driving</a> had a chance to be Three Fields' big 'Burnout's back, baby' moments, conclusively proving to the suits at EA that locking the series in the attic of dormant entities was a hugely short-sighted move. Neither quite managed to stick the landing, though. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckreation-melds-burnouts-anarchy-with-gta-onlines-airborne-marble-runs-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-polish">my hours playing both</a>, I've never felt like that faliure was down to them being cynical nostalgia-fests, attempts to cash in on the anarchic old arcade racers myself and others fell in love with. Instead, and perhaps this is because I've gone in each time hoping I'll be blown away, the two games felt like the vision was solid, but the small studio just hadn't been able to nail the nuances of execution.</p><p>They weren't a million miles off reigniting the magic of classic Burnout, with EA and Criterion's substantial resources behind it. They're still yet to get there, though. Here's hoping that another publisher who're willing to back Three Fields swoop in and as always, solidarity to the studio's staff as they face an uncertain future.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today. The Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 game was already getting dinged in some people’s minds over a trailer that showcased overly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368"><span>chatty companion characters</span></a><span>. Now we’ve moved on from side-eyeing MCU-era cringe to debates about whether or not the game even looks good. A lot of folks are throwing tomatoes at the supposedly lifeless open-world segments on social media, but people who are actually playing </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>tell a different story.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, some </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>screenshots are pretty rough. The game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-amiibo-samus-music-motorcycle-functionality-2000650508"><span>desert sections</span></a><span> can look pretty bland in still shots, and without any real dynamic weather effects or notable architecture and landmarks, they look like something out of a game from almost 20 years ago. The comparisons to older games that it resembles, or even older games that are doing a lot more with their environments, are not flattering.</span></p>

There are plenty of ugly areas in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, but there are also ones that look pretty lovely. </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, though? That shit looks like an ugly GameCube game that was still in early development, no matter where you are. So when another big Nintendo game seems to be following the same open-world style at the expense of detailed environments, it’s understandable why some folks would be worried.</span></p>

 <p><span>In general, </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has some notable graphic disparities depending on the environment you’re in. Folks have been noting this before the game was even out by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1nf7yrd/i_cant_wrap_my_head_around_how_theres_such_a_big/"><span>comparing shots from the same trailer</span></a><span>, in which the game oscillated between looking pretty alright to looking like the shots people are complaining about.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, some of this feels like knee-jerk reactions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>’s series-low reviews. The game is sitting at </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/"><span>a respectable 81 on review aggregate site Metacritic</span></a><span>, but that is a bit of a drop compared to the 90+ scores of the first three games. I saw folks on a ResetEra forum saying this was “an absolute failure” or a “fucking disaster” for the historically beloved series, so some of this drive-by hate feels a bit reactionary to a game some people have already decided is a flop.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But what are people who have actually played the game saying? I was surprised to see some folks on my feed also call it one of the best-looking games Nintendo had brought to its handheld console. However, most of the praise points specifically to the smaller-scale dungeon areas, rather than the open-world ones, even comparing its mood and visual identity to the </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>games, which makes sense considering staff who used to work on the series at 343 Industries have </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1996542214466687263"><span>moved over to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>developer Retro</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retro’s art design still rocks! Metroid Prime 4 is a visual stunner — and no framerate drops in sight.

 <p><span>“Within each dungeon-like area to explore, Metroid Prime 4 shines, mixing tactile FPS exploration with gorgeous visuals and impeccable atmosphere,” Oscar Taylor-Kent said in the </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span> review.</span></p> <p><span>Now that players have </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> in their hands, some are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pdrahj/stunned_how_good_prime_4_looks_within_first_hour/"><span>praising the visuals</span></a><span>, especially in those smaller, more focused spaces.</span></p> <p><span>“Retro is a master of using mostly baked plus some tasteful dynamic lighting to achieve great visuals,” Reddit user threeinacorner wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“You really need to see it on a highly capable OLED TV with really good HDR.

<p>Total War: Medieval 3 has been confirmed by the developers through a new announcement; the title is currently in its early pre-production stage. </p>



<p>The last instalment of Total War: Medieval was launched back in 2006, and the players have been aching for a new iteration of the series. Fortunately for them, Medieval 3 has been announced, and the developers have shared a wealth of details about the project through a new blog post and trailer. </p>







<h2 id="h-total-war-medieval-3-will-be-the-ultimate-what-if-game">Total War: Medieval 3 Will Be the Ultimate “What If” Game</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> featured Total War: Medieval 3’s game director, Pawel Wojs, providing players with all the details about the upcoming title. Wojs has worked on the previous instalment for almost 20 years and is now going to lead the latest project. The developer’s vision is to make Medieval 3 “the Total War sandbox set within the Medieval world and to be the ultimate “What if?” game where you can alter the course of history.” Interested readers can learn more about their <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vision</a> here.</p>

<p>The developers plan to achieve this by immersing players in historical accuracy and having the world respond “in ways that feel genuinely plausible.” The game is currently in early pre-production, with release years away, and they are just past the opening stages. The developers also have Warxore now, which is the next evolution of their game engine, which provides them “a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks – all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve.”</p>

</figure>
<h2>Fly Like a Blood Eagle</h2><p>One of the major selling points of <em>Cloudheim</em> is its fast-paced, high-flying combat. You begin the game with a triple jump by default; that alone should give you an idea of the tone being set here.</p><p>Combat mainly involves fighting a dozen small enemies and a couple of larger (usually armored) enemies and scoring dozens or hundreds of hits in a single battle. You have a few abilities that you can use situationally, and damage can be avoided by dodging on the ground or in the air.</p><p>That's not to say that you can bounce around the battlefield forever. Every ability — including your dodge — has a certain number of charges. Use up those charges, and casting that ability again will cause "mana burn" to build up.</p><p>If you fill up the mana burn meter, you both slow down and lose the ability to cast any of your abilities. In principle, the idea is to use combos and abilities carefully to take down enemies without building up too much mana burn.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current state of combat feels a little bland. I successfully button-mashed my way through 50 or so hours of gameplay with few problems; as long as I dodged the more serious enemy attacks, I was fine. Another layer of complexity is needed here for the combat system to truly feel engaging.</p><figure role="group">

The back of this turtle serves as a safe haven where you can build crafting devices, specialized structures, and decorations.</p><blockquote><p>The shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p></blockquote><p>You're not alone on this island, either. Adorable little creatures called "Blins" inhabit this place with you, and they can be assigned to certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-building-guide-how-to-get-blins" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="de5d4611-4621-4a93-b9c8-33c18678a2e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">buildings</a> to work for you. You could, for example, assign a Blin to a prospecting site. When you next return to Odin's Shell, you'll find that it is filled with crafting materials for you to mine.</p><p>Perhaps the strangest inclusion of all is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-shop-guide-how-to-sell-items" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="314316d3-dc01-4826-a864-237ed4ac24e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shop</a>. Though it only occupies a small part of the game's description, the shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p><p>Alternating between exploring the world, advancing quests, and selling items in your shop forms the core gameplay loop of <em>Cloudheim</em>. It can be fairly engaging and entertaining (combat shallowness aside) — at least when it comes to the systems that are actually implemented.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Missing Mechanics</h2><p>A casual scroll through the building options or the in-game archive makes it seem like <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot to offer. My actual experience with the pre-launch version of the game, however, painted a somewhat different picture.</p><p>Important systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-forge-guide-purify-and-smelt-ore" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="496c455c-6646-4c23-ac60-1f9c6601e4e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">smelting and forging weapons</a> are implemented, and they work well enough. In the early game, it doesn't really feel like anything is missing. This changes as you advance deeper into the game and the building system.</p><p>Take Alchemy, for example. You can find and grow plants that can then be converted into potions. However, the potions you get are entirely random, and they have no gameplay effect whatsoever; currently, potions are only used as stock for the shop.</p><p>This also applies to cooking. Menus allude to cooked food, and you can find bits of food (such as cheese wheels) as random loot, but you can't actually do anything with food other than sell it.</p><p>The lack of practical cooking and alchemy applications also renders the fishing system somewhat useless. I'm sure the alchemy, cooking, and fishing systems will get fleshed out some more in future updates. For now, there isn't much there.</p><p>I also encountered one major chunk of missing content at the end of the second island. Although the map implies that you can visit four major regions, the final dungeon at the end of the second island simply doesn't open. Progression tends to drag toward this point, making it much more difficult to move on to the third and fourth islands.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Cloudheim</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Like many games of this style, <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot of potential. The first island of content is solid, and the second island has a good chunk of content on it. You can probably expect a solid 20 or so hours of gameplay from what's there.</p><p>That said, there are still plenty of rough edges that need to be ironed out. If you're fine with trying a game that is very Early Access in a lot of ways right now, you should consider checking out <em>Cloudheim</em> and enjoying a somewhat different take on the whole Viking thing.</p><hr><p><em>Cloudheim</em> was previewed over approximately 50 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2070270/Cloudheim/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher.

<p>As one who thoroughly enjoys cozy games with robust building components in their gameplay, one was pleasantly surprised by how much content players will have access to in helping them create some gorgeously designed spaces. Whether it's a warm and cozy retreat perfect for finishing that novel along the snow-capped mountains, a mostly soundproof home to record that next radio smash hit, or a beach house to welcome family and friends for the holidays, there's plenty of design and decorating elements for players to explore and have fun with.</p><p>Sure, not everything featured in <em>Log Away</em> is perfect, and there are a few missed windows of opportunity that could've been capitalized on, aside from some technical issues experienced; this indie cozy sandbox‑building game makes for the ideal game to escape the toils and troubles of the world. And to celebrate the game's release, players can adorn their home in time for Christmas with themed seasonal items as part of a free DLC available until December 11th, 2025.</p><h2>Synergized Hearts And Spaces</h2><p>Jumping into <em>Log Away</em> comes with some hand-holding before players can truly let their creativity run freely, as a tutorial will guide players in learning gameplay and control basics. Additionally, they'll have access to plenty of building and decorating components and items to lay the foundations of the dream vacation home, from minimalist, rustic pieces to modern chic and beach-themed items, and, of course, seasonal Christmas items available through the themed DLC.</p><p>While the primary goal is to design and build their home away from home, they also have a Coziness System, which is fronted by the Cozy Heart. This unique mechanic, akin to a "thermometer" is an in-game meter that gradually gets filled up based on how cozy your living spaces are, or as the developer states, "a reflection of coziness" and this can be achieved by the number of items placed on the plot, where they're placed and more importantly, if these placed items match similar items to develop a synergy (think a table and chairs).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Carefully place similar furnishing and decor items together in a space to gain synergy and increase the home's coziness. (Picture: The-Mark Entertainment / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One will admit they didn't pay much attention to these synergies at first, as they were stumped when they realized the Cozy Heart meter wasn't gradually building up as one wanted; it was after rereading the tutorial that one realized that placing similar items together increased one's coziness meter. Additionally, it could be said that items from the same destination, pick, or interest may help increase a home's coziness; however, this was challenging to track and confirm.</p><p>Regardless, by default, we were placing similar objects together, for example: items attributed to the Writing interest or from a seaside/beach landscape can help increase the coziness if placed together in the same area. This may help and guide players into designing and decorating their indoor and outdoor spaces more thematically, and once maxxed out, they'll earn mementos called Keepsakes, each of which has an associated backstory and memory, and can be placed within their spaces to showcase them proudly.</p><p>These Keepsakes are specific to the interests players selected for their retreat, as there are 24 Keepsakes per interest to discover and obtain, but they cannot be acquired in a single retreat, so multiple retreat builds are likely needed for all Keepsakes to be unlocked. Nevertheless, players will be able to enjoy what Log Away has to offer without time constraints or pressure from them, and instead can be best enjoyed in their own time.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>To make the most of their in-game cozy experiences while designing and building their dream retreat, there are a few additional features to enjoy, including a photo mode with unique filters and options to capture their beautiful homes (which can make for great postcards). The game also features soundtracks to serve as the main playlist while building their homes, as players can change up the soundtrack, but also toggle day and night time, and seasons to find the perfect weather conditions to warm up to in their beautifully decorated homes.</p><h2>Not Quite A Warm Welcome</h2><p>As mentioned before, not everything included or offered in <em>Log Away</em> is picture-perfect, and we had our fair share of issues we've encountered during the review process. Gameplay-wise, the biggest gripe during the review process is the lack of real estate when building our holiday cabin, as players will only have a 7x7 plot to work with.</p><p>As someone who's spent hours in <em>Tiny Glade</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/palia-starter-guide" rel="nofollow"><em>Palia</em></a>, both games which provide massive plot for players to build and decorate their homes, this small-sized plot is quite restrictive and at times, quite challenging to work with, especially towards maxxing out the Cozy Heart meter. Switching gears to game optimization and performance, when loading a saved game file or starting a new retreat, the graphics appeared distorted or grainy/grain-like, which, coupled with slow loading times, was a slight annoyance to be confronted with.</p><p>While the game controls are simple and easy to understand, toggling between building, furnishing, and decorating (or BFD stamps) can be clunky at times; the camera movement is what quickly became a slight nuisance. Whether it was to zoom in to place an object carefully or remove flowers or pathing, or zoom out to get the full view of our progress on the project, the camera movement and speed are extremely clunky and laggy, which makes using Photo Mode quite frustrating.</p><h2><em>Log Away</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<p><em>Log Away</em> provided the ideal form of escapism, transporting players to tranquil destinations where they could build and decorate their dream vacation home. With plenty of building tools, furnishings, and decor items available for players to access on top of the thematical items and the Christmas DLC, players will be well occupied in designing, building, and decorating their spaces.</p><p>The game's coziness system is at the very heart of creating the ideal ambiance for their perfect getaway home by maximizing what space they have with the pieces they've selected to increase the coziness and, by doing so, unlocking Keepsakes. However, there are a few issues with optimization and performance due to buggy camera movement that hampered our experience in building, furnishing, or decorating mode.</p><p>This can also be transferred onto the Photo Mode, which made taking snaps of our completed projects or projects in progress a challenging process, as zooming and panning over the property gets laggy. Alongside these issues, the decision to lock players to a 7x7 building space on a massive plot is an interesting choice, as one hopes the plot size increases to give us more room to create more beautiful spaces and unlock more treasured memories to own as Keepsakes.</p><p>After all, we'll still be here for the cozy vibes and the profound memories from those treasured Keepsakes.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Log Away&nbsp;</strong>was reviewed on PC via Steam, with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours&nbsp;- all screenshots were taken during the review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass has gone through some turbulent times of late, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">sheen completely coming off the subscription service</a> as it made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">its cheaper tiers much less worthwhile</a>, followed by a series of price increases building to October’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">sudden 50 percent hike</a>. $30 a month is a heck of an investment, given that in 2023 it cost half of that, so if you’re paying, you’ll want to get the best out of it. And with over 400 games currently included, finding the stuff worth playing gets harder and harder. So to make life easier, we’ve gone through the jumbled pile and picked out the 10 best RPGs to play.</p> <p>There are, by Microsoft’s count, 307 games on Xbox Game Pass that it considers to be RPGs. But given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">genre titles mean close to nothing now</a>, and all genres are merging together, a fair number of them are stretches. For instance, this list isn’t going to include any&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, no matter how many RPG elements the series has begun to include over the years. They can have their day in a Best Action Games list and be happy about it.</p>

 <p>Anyway, here are 10 of the best RPGs to install on your Xbox if you’re subscribed to Game Pass, with a good mix of the blatantly obvious and the somewhat more obscure.</p> <hr> <h2>Avowed</h2>  <p>I said it’d include the obvious, but it’d be criminal not to recommend one of the best new RPGs in&nbsp;<em>years</em>. Obsidian’s first/third-person free-roaming take on its glorious&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series proved to be <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">an absolutely cracking success</a>. It’s real-time magic-n-swords combat works brilliantly, in a world that’s as rich and detailed and packed with character as either of the previous, more traditional <em>Pillars</em> games. Plus, it offers so many extraordinary choices that you can play it all over again as soon as you’re done.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Dragon Age: Origins</h2>  <p>If you prefer, you can assume this entry to be for any of the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games, given EA has all four of them included on Game Pass, including last year’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. But the first one, <em>Origins</em>, will always be the best. It was the result of ten years of work, with an obvious depth of lore and history showing the results of such an extraordinary investment of time. It also plays out with a combination of real-time and pauseable combat, allowing you to approach it new-school or old. It is one of the most wonderful RPG stories ever told.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Fallout: New Vegas (PC Only)</h2>  <p>Yes, you can play the more recently revamped&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em> on Game Pass too, but if I’m picking just one of the series’ first-person era, it has to be Obsidian’s <em>New Vegas</em>. It’s scientifically proven to be the best of the lot, and it remains a gruesome tragedy that it’s not received a modern glow-up. But what better time to play this incredibly deep, post-apocalyptic RPG than in the weeks before Amazon Prime’s stunning&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> TV series reaches Vegas in its second season?</p>

 <hr> <h2>Moonlighter</h2>  <p>At a time when so many would-be RPGs have split off into the realm of the roguelite,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em> straddles the two fields like a mighty but modest titan. This adorably splendid game combines running a local store with the need to go off on deathly adventures to find loot to sell in said store. The result is a gorgeous mix of action-RPG and shop-running, town-building loveliness. There’s a sequel in early access on Game Pass too.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>  <p>One of 2025’s breakout hits, not least thanks <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-xbox-goty-2000650073">to its inclusion on Game Pass</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has made turn-based RPG combat sexy again. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">definitely-not-an-indie game</a> from French developers Sandfall Interactive has a story that twists and turns as its chapters progress, a uniquely interesting defense system, and a voice cast to die for.</p>

 <hr>   <p>There’s no escaping it. It might be 14 years old (although this Special Edition is a mere nine), but <em>Skyrim</em> is still one of the best RPGs ever made. Bethesda’s colossal open-world RPG (long before everyone else was doing that) is still one of the most splendid ways to wile away a spare couple of months. Grab a horse, climb a mountain, find a mysterious cave, turn into a vampire, join a cult, and begin a life of crime, all before lunch.</p> <hr> <h2>Arx Fatalis (PC only)</h2>  <p>I’ve tried to stick to RPG games that can be played on both Xbox consoles and PC, but I can’t leave&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> off the list. This is from Arkane, the creators of <em>Dishonored</em> and&nbsp;<em>Prey</em>, and it’s every bit as much a demonstration of that (monstrously closed) studio’s talent. Originally released in 2002, despite being great, this was a first-person RPG that your dad loved but was a commercial flop. Thanks to the same hateful deal that killed Arkane, the game is now in Microsoft/Bethesda’s library and on Game Pass.</p> <hr> <h2>Citizen Sleeper 2</h2>  <p>Both&nbsp;<em>Citizen Sleeper</em> and its sequel are on Xbox Game Pass, so you can start at the beginning of these dark, cyber-noir RPG adventures if you so choose. The original game takes place around a single planet, the second an entire solar system, where the roll of the dice decides so much of the fate from which you’re endlessly trying to escape. They’re <a href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-review-steam-rpg-scifi-cowboy-bebop-1851751947">fantastic games</a>, unlike anything else out there, with stunning writing and the sensibilities of the best of tabletop gaming.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Diablo IV</h2>  <p>As much as I may have moaned about genre blurring at the start, there’s no question that action-RPGs are RPGs. For a while, the genre was so specifically dominated by <em>Diablo</em> that it was known as “Diablo-likes,” and it remains the case that Blizzard’s creations rule the roost. Yes, there are those who play these games for their endgame loops and grinds, but don’t let that put you off: clicking your way through the story and combat of the core game is a rewarding experience in its own right.</p> <hr> <h2>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</h2>  <p>Has there been a more consistently great trilogy of RPG games than&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>? Well, have it out in the comments. But in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Legendary Edition</em> is all three of the&nbsp;<em>good</em> games in the series, remastered in 4K, and with all 40 pieces of DLC. It’s a glorious story, and while many were unsatisfied with the (excellent—fight me) ending, the space adventure trilogy remains one of video gaming’s all-time highlights.</p> <hr> <p>Your favorite Game Pass RPG isn’t here? That’s because we found out you like it so much and deliberately left it off the list to make you mad. So get revenge by explaining what you’d have included instead of&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk space can be pretty limited, so the last thing you may want is a bulky PC tower taking up half of it. A mini PC is a great solution, offering the same functionality while taking up hardly any room. Whether you’re a business owner, student, or casual user, a mini PC is ideal—and it’s usually more affordable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/">Take a look here: the GMKtec Mini NucBox G5 PC is typically priced at $260, but right now, it’s available at a 31% discount, bringing it down to just $180—saving you $80.</a></p>
<p>This compact device measures just 2.83 x 2.83 x 1.75 inches, making it small enough to fit in your pocket. It’s powered by an Intel 12th-generation Alder Lake N97 processor, capable of reaching speeds up to 3.6GHz. This should be more than enough for everyday tasks like web browsing, light creative work, software development, or playing casual games. It comes with 12GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which you can upgrade to as much as 2TB if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With Wi-Fi 5 support, you can enjoy fast upload and download speeds when connected to a Wi-Fi 5 network. The mini PC also features Bluetooth 5.0, making it easy to connect to various accessories. Ports include two USB 3.2 slots on the front and one on the back, plus a USB-C port. The HDMI output supports up to 4K resolution at 60Hz, and with dual HDMI ports, you can connect two displays at once—no need for a docking station. There’s also an AUX jack for connecting headphones or desktop speakers.</p>
<h2>Why Choose a Mini PC?</h2>
<p>If you’re living in a small apartment or sharing a space with roommates, you probably know that every inch of your desk matters. A large PC tower can take up precious room that you may not be willing to sacrifice. A mini PC, on the other hand, offers a lot of the capabilities of a desktop PC but in a much smaller footprint. This one is even small enough that you could feasibly mount it to the back of a monitor, so it effectively would have no foot print at all.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also make great multimedia players. While many modern TVs have smart features with the ability to play from apps like Netflix and Hulu, a mini PC can still make for a better option that just using what’s built into your TV. It’s a full Windows device, meaning it can handle more types of media formats (especially for locally saved files) than your typical smart TV or streaming stick.</p>
<p>Additionally, a mini PC is perfect for running a PLEX server, allowing you to access your media library from anywhere. They’re also great for emulating retro games, as they don’t require much processing power to run ROMs. Just make sure you legally own the games you are emulating, but also I’m not the one checking up on you. You do you.</p>
