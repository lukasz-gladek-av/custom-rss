			<p>The function of the Nintendo Switch 2 new Joy-Con controller C button has yet to be officially revealed, but there's the chance that we will get to celebrate the unexpected return of the Wii U console when it will, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s"> eXstas1s</a>, who proved to be an overall reliable insider in the past, revealed that, according to their sources, the C button will be used, among other things, to connect the Nintendo Switch 2 to an original Switch console to use it as a controller or an additional screen, essentially turning the previous generation console into something akin to the Wii U GamePad. As not every Nintendo Switch 2 user may also be the owner of its predecessor, there's no doubt that this connectivity feature will be completely optional, but, on the other hand, it could open up some very interesting possibilities, such as proper emulation of Nintendo DS and 3DS games.</p>
<p><iframe title="BOOM ‚òÑÔ∏è XBOX + STEAM : √öLTIMA Hora ü•µ SWITCH 2 Bot√≥n C: AS√ç FUNCIONA ü§î JUEGOS de PS5 en NINTENDO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2QbjzzdVj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While eXstas1s has proven to be somewhat reliable in the past, we have to take this Nintendo Switch 2 rumor with a grain of salt until the C button functionality is officially revealed next week. At the same time, a patent that emerged online<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dual-screen-patent/"> earlier this month</a> suggested some sort of dual-screen functionality for the system, so the ability to use the original Switch as a second screen doesn't sound all that improbable.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches later this year worldwide. The console's release date is expected to be revealed next week during a dedicated Nintendo Direct.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/638317/helldivers-2-avx2-cpu-requirement-lockout-sony<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/umar-shakir">Umar Shakir</a> <span>is a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are reporting that they can no longer play the game on their computers equipped with older CPUs. The issue stems from the developer Arrowhead Game Studios‚Äô and publisher Sony‚Äôs requirement that users play on systems that support AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions), which has been a feature in many CPUs since 2013. However, the requirement was not properly enforced in the software, allowing some players with older hardware to play the game since it was launched for PC last year.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-suddenly-unplayable-for-some-pc-players-on-older-systems"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>, players on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord server have voiced their displeasure with suddenly not being able to launch a game they have paid for and have been playing. ‚Äú600+ hours in a game I love just to be locked out is making me so frustrated to the point I just want to ask for a refund instead of fixing their mistakes,‚Äù said a user.</p><p>Server moderator Birby responded to some of those complaining and explained that ‚Äúthe AVX2 check in the script is experimental, and can throw false positives.‚Äù The moderator blamed users for not following the stated minimum system requirements. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to have to tell people their 13 year old processor is out of date,‚Äù said the moderator. ‚ÄúYou should never be surprised if your out of spec machine can‚Äôt run the game.‚Äù</p><p>Still, players with the older CPUs likely have PCs or laptops that aren‚Äôt upgradable, so they will need to prepare to spend a lot of money on a totally new system.</p><p>This isn‚Äôt Sony‚Äôs first unpopular move made on PC <em>Helldivers 2</em> players. Last year the company had forced PSN account requirements for PC users, but then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">pulled back after all the negative reviews on Steam</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-baby-steps-i-stumbled-through-a-refreshing-kind-of-open-world.1147965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638179/baby-steps-preview-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>‚ÄúIs the rage boiling over?‚Äù Bennett Foddy asks me as I fall down a wooden plank for the dozenth time. The creator of <em>QWOP</em> and <em>Getting Over It</em> is known for games that can be both frustrating and meditative, pairing challenging physics with thoughtful design. The latest, <em>Baby Steps</em>, is similar ‚Äî but a whole lot bigger.</p><p>I had a chance to play a chunk of the early portion of <em>Baby Steps</em> at 2025‚Äôs Game Developers Conference earlier this month. The game is developed by a trio made up of Foddy, Maxi Boch, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255975/ape-out-game-pc-nintendo-switch"><em>Ape Out</em></a> creator Gabe Cuzzillo. It starts out pretty silly: you play as a slacker named Nate who is transported to a strange world with little choice but to hike. There are cutscenes where he babbles in confusion at his situation and a handful of characters who aren‚Äôt especially helpful. At one point, someone offers Nate a map, and he refuses; there is no gear that aids your adventure in <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p><p>Instead, the game is perhaps the most literal definition of a walking simulator. You move by controlling Nate‚Äôs two legs individually to take steps. At first, I couldn‚Äôt take more than a few steps before falling flat on my face, which, to be fair, was often hilarious. The physics makes the wipeouts in <em>Baby Steps</em> entertaining to watch. But it was also infuriating. Walking is supposed to be the easy part of a video game; you push the stick forward and go where you want to. But here, even the tiniest obstacle proved troublesome. The first time I saw a small staircase, I wondered how I‚Äôd ever make it.</p><p>But slowly, through a lot of trial and error, I fell into a rhythm. It reminded me a bit of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a>, where I had to carefully pay attention to my movements if I wanted to get anywhere. For just regular walking up a path, this meant timing my steps just right so that I didn‚Äôt stumble. For obstacles like logs or staircases, it meant taking my time and carefully placing my foot where it needed to go. It never got easy, but at least I felt in control of my movements after a while.</p><p><em>Baby Steps</em> takes place in what seems like a fairly large and open world, the kind of place where you can see something on the horizon and go there. The trick, of course, is being able to actually walk toward it. Early on, I came to a fork in the road: on one side was a gently sloping hill that led further up the mountain; on the other, a wooden plank across a muddy slope that led right back down to the bottom. After some deliberation, I attempted to get across the plank and, two steps later, found myself sliding in the mud.</p><p>The developers tell me that <em>Baby Steps</em> is built on the idea of ‚Äúself guided play,‚Äù meaning there are no artificial obstacles in your way, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about things like health or death. It‚Äôs just you and the environment. And while it might not seem like it at first, the game isn‚Äôt really designed to be punishing. As an example, when I had my big fall down the mountain, it didn‚Äôt send me back to the beginning but instead brought me somewhere new that I wouldn‚Äôt have seen otherwise. It also taught me an important lesson about taking on challenges I‚Äôm ready for.</p><p>I played for less than an hour, but I could already feel myself settling into a contemplative style of exploration I‚Äôve experienced in games like <em>Death Stranding</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>. There were no quests to complete or to-do lists to check off. Just me, my legs, and a serene mountain full of risks and rewards.</p><p><em>Baby Steps</em> launches later this year on Steam and the PS5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Designed to be a guidebook authored by the mysterious Merchant who appears at the start of each level, Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire covers locations and secrets from the award-winning game.</p><p>"Vampire survivors are on a relentless quest," the official plot synopsis reads. "Stumbling through the Mad Forest, climbing the calamitous Gallo Tower, searching the far reaches of the Inlaid Library. The Belpaese family, the Ladonnas, assorted clerics and supernatural folk all join the search. Why is there roast chicken everywhere? How is that dog making flowers bloom? And who ‚Äì or what ‚Äì is Poe Ratcho?</p><p>And where are the vampires? That‚Äôs where I come in. I am the Merchant, and I can be your guide. If you have gold of course. Always gold. If you seek coffins, I may know where to find them--for a price. Though I cannot guarantee you‚Äôll find the vampires you seek."</p></div>                      </div><p>In case you haven't played it yet, Vampire Survivors is a fun game that feels deceptively simple to play. Unlike other bullet-hell adventures where you have to constantly dodge projectiles, the game flips that script on its head and turns you into a tornado of doom as you gradually increase your power through a 30-minute run. The catch here is that the longer you survive the more progressively difficult a level becomes, and even if you can last for 30 minutes, the Grim Reaper will always be ready to claim your life at the end. The game is very affordable, and if you have a Game Pass account, available to play on PC and Xbox through that subscription service.</p><hr><p>It's going to be a while before this book is available, but in the meantime, you can score a pretty great deal on a bunch of other video game lore and art books.

During the network test, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to revive downed players.</p><p>However, players will lose the Runes they've accumulated if they fall in battle, as a result of not being revived in time. A total of 37,957,453,867 Runes were lost during the network test. Runes are earned by defeating enemies, with stronger ones dropping more. Here are the most formidable ones during the network test and how many were killed:</p><ul><li><strong>Golden Hippopotamus:</strong> 194,996</li><li><strong>Flame Chariot:</strong> 164,974</li><li><strong>Fire Monk:</strong> 150,128</li><li><strong>Flying Dragon of the Hills:</strong> 147,202</li><li><strong>Royal Army Knights:</strong> 98,738</li></ul><p>Elden Ring Nightrein's traversal is much faster than the typical Soulslike game.

These creatures were summoned 427,533 times.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign will launch on May 30 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Netflix Gaming boss Alain Tascan has outlined his vision for the future of gaming at Netflix, and his aim is to help reduce "friction" similar to how the Wii helped opened things up for a wider audience.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business,</a> Tascan said when he worked at EA, one of his ambitions was around "lowering friction and eliminating it." He was a big fan of the Wii because it was a lower-priced console that appealed to a wide audience, and Tascan wants to try to achieve something similar at Netflix.</p><p>Tascan said some of the frictions that exists in gaming today is the need to have enough controllers in a home and having an "expensive" piece of dedicated gaming hardware. Waiting for game downloads is another friction, Tascan said. Netflix Gaming aims to offer solutions in these areas by eliminating the need for dedicated gaming consoles and controllers, in part because Netflix aims to offer games over the cloud. In fact, cloud-streaming games is already available on Netflix.com under the Games tab.</p><p>Tascan hopes Netflix can create more "party games" that can help people have fun quickly--without the need for a console or a special controller.</p><p>"For party games, I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone controller as a very innovative controller," he said. "On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen‚Ä¶ if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you're alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?"</p><p>Tascan went on to say that what he's excited about at Netflix is helping games reach more people.</p><p>"The same way mobile opened up gaming to go beyond 150--200 million players to now 3.2--3.3 billion players, I believe we can reach to a larger number of players," he said. "Does it really need to be these super complicated RPG-style games? There is a place for them, for sure. But this for me this is what's interesting. Netflix is giving us this opportunity to have access to these people. What do we give them, and in what way, so they can enjoy and engage with [games] over and over?"</p><p>Finally, Tascan addressed a question regarding Netflix's commitment to gaming. After all, the company already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">shuttered its AAA game studio to instead focus on mobile and party games</a>. Google, many will remember, was heavily invested in gaming with its Stadia product, only to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stadia-is-officially-dead/1100-6510708/" data-ref-id="1100-6510708">quickly shutter it. </a></p><p>Tascan said to find success in a market like gaming, "it takes time, stubbornness, and investment to get great results." Not every company is willing to put in the time and effort, but Tascan said Netflix is different.</p><p>"If you look at our two Co-CEOs, Ted [Sarandos] has been in the company 25 years, Greg [Peters] over 15 years. And look at where Netflix was 10 years ago in terms of their core business. They know the path of being stubborn, hard-working, innovating, having a vision and going after it," Tascan said. "The road is not always straight to the top. But I believe them when they told me that gaming was important, because if [Netflix] wants to entertain the world then there‚Äôs no-way around it, we need to be in games. When I look at these two leaders in particular, but also the rest of management, I believe in their full commitment."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> publisher Bandai Namco has released some player statistics from the game's network test last month, and it seems players were struggling to finish it.</p>
<p>The online co-op game takes place over three in-game days, defeating bosses each night to progress the next. However, the final boss of the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times.</p>
<p>The publisher hasn't released total player numbers, but looking at the <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-infographic">remaining stats</a> we can get an idea of how popular the test was.</p>

</figure>
<p>For instance, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to save downed players. Considering it takes around three hits to revive a player in this way (sometimes more), that's about 7.9m revives.</p>
<p>Further, the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>Lastly, 37,957,453,867 runes were lost during the test, when not retrieved after death. That's a lot of death - and a lot of heartache.</p>
<p>In all, it seems players were struggling to get to grips with Nightreign. The shift to online co-op and a faster pace may have proven a challenge for players, whether through poor explanation from FromSoftware or just not enough time to master the game during the test.</p>
<p>And that's when players even managed to get on - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">first of several tests over that weekend was a disaster</a>, with players completely unable to log into a match. This was resolved for the remainder of the weekend.</p>
<p>Of course, FromSoftware's games are known for being difficult. In particular, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> caused much debate with its difficulty level. Just give it time and somebody will be finishing Nightreign with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">banana controller</a>.</p>
<p>Personally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">I had a great time playing Nightreign</a> and enjoyed its new style of challenge, as well as working with others - though I had a decent chunk of time with it during the preview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">Elden Ring: Nightreign is set for release on 30th May 2025</a> across PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><span>Despite burgeoning budgets and development teams growing to the dozens, if not hundreds, the AA gaming space is something where it‚Äôs rare to see a developer thrive. MercurySteam has been crafting up a variety of third-person adventure titles over the years, and we recently went hands-on with their latest adventure, slated to release in just two months. <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blades of Fire</a> is one of those titles that might sound average on paper but certainly holds its own with the right tempering.</span></p>
<p><span>After a brief backstory introducing the world of Blades of Fire, from the world once ruled by mighty giants known as The Forgers to an evil Queen whose magic can turn steel into stone, the lore of iron and blood runs deep through this adventure‚Äôs DNA. Players pick up the hammer of Aran de Lira, a commander‚Äôs son and subsequent blacksmith whose character designs can only be described as a down-on-his-luck Gabriel Belmont. After a brief introduction, Blades of Fire introduces the plucky sidekick Adso and an abbot whose screen time lasts a mere couple of sentences before his life is cut short, yet serves as the catalyst to send this duo on an adventure to slay the merciless Queen. It‚Äôs just enough to set the mood before Aran de Lira and his new travel buddy venture out, accompanied by a travel montage and a brief tutorial on weapon crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Weapon crafting seems to be the main hook to Blades of Fire, setting it apart from other character action titles. By venturing back to The Forge between worlds, players can first pick out a learned recipe and put it together with the various ores and woods that have been wicked up during the journey; naturally, I only had access to the very bottom tier of materials given that I was playing from a fresh save file. Once all the materials are acquired and distributed, a separate mini-game plays out where the player has to hammer out any impurities and even out the thickness of metal to match the shape of the blade.</span></p>
<p><span>There‚Äôs a strange system where I had to select a portion of the blade on a sliding scale and then slide the intensity up and down to impact not just that particular section of the blade but also by raising and lowering the surrounding regions. It was not a system that led itself to being too intuitive to crafting a perfectly even blade and I spent too much time just trying to even out the peaks and trying to come as close as I could to the intended shape of the blade. Initially, this doesn‚Äôt seem to do much for the blade beyond raising its core stats like damage and durability, but there were other mechanics on offer, such as changing the type and material of the handle or additional flourishes and accessories to the weapon. The Forge itself feels like the main source of progression throughout Aran de Lira‚Äôs journey and the ability to customize every minute stat to a particular weapon might end to some interesting builds for crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Blades of Fire also features an interesting combat system where attacks are done across all four face buttons and determine where Aran‚Äôs strikes will land. You don‚Äôt often see games that map body parts to a specific button, so it took some time to get used to aiming for an enemy‚Äôs left arm versus its right if it happened to be less armored in that location. Aran can wield two separate blades in combat and swap between the two. Each weapon can deal damage between slashing, blunt and piercing attacks, with some offering up multiple damage types. There‚Äôs an obvious effectiveness system at play where different body parts on an enemy will glow in colors from red to green that show how effectively a particular weapon or damage type works. </span></p>
<p><span>As much as players might want to forge an unstoppable sword and carry it through the adventure, the weapon's effectiveness coupled with a durability system for every weapon means that routine trips to The Forge will be required. As is typical of most action RPGs these days, combat is driven through a stamina system that dwindles down quickly through dodges and repeated attacks. It does recover on its own, but Aran de Lira can hold down L2 and go into a defensive position and recover at a faster rate.</span></p>

<p><span>MercurySteam‚Äôs strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn‚Äôt on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It‚Äôs just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven‚Äôt seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I‚Äôd still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies when Blades of Fire launches on May 22nd across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and the Epic Games Store.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed some fun statistics for the recent&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>network test, in which those lucky enough to be invited got a glimpse of what can be expected from the game's final release later this year.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1905622167158432218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Bandai Namco shared what it called its "Numbers from the Night", and it turns out that across the network test as a whole, players slaughtered the Gladius, Beast of Night boss 58,615 times. That's a lot of dead Nightlords.</p>

<p>Spectral Hawks, the ghostly birds used to ferry players across&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s map, were summoned 427,533 times across the network test, while 23.6 million recovery attacks were used to help downed players get back on their feet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=7Iz2zJVv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=Iruk7NEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hundreds of thousands of these little ghostly birbs were summoned during&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s network test.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s minibosses, players killed almost 200,000 Golden Hippopotamuses (Hippopotami?), almost 165,000 Flame Chariots, and just over 150,000 Fire Monks.</p>

<p>Almost 150,000 Flying Dragons of the Hills were killed, and almost 100,000 Royal Knights met their ends at the hands of enterprising warriors. If you think you're going to struggle in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, let these numbers give you some solace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, almost 38 billion (!) runes were lost by players cumulatively over the course of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s network test. I like to imagine that 37 billion of those were just one very, very unlucky player.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming action RPG spinoff of FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it represents the developer's first major spinoff for one of its properties.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign</em>'s core gameplay loop sees you and two other players (or just you, but not you and one other) descending onto a map in order to loot it, kill its bosses for XP, and grow strong enough to battle the Nightlord at the end of a three-day period.</p>

<p>The game will feature not only enemies from&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, but also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">foes featured in FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, including the likes of the first game's Centipede Demon,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2</em>'s The Duke's Dear Freja, and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Nameless King.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">on May 30th</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

It feels like the first genuinely adult-focused project within the MCU, and its shocking brutality is all the more surprising for being created by Disney. (While <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> had gore and naughty words, it‚Äôs hard to really credit the silly movie with being ‚Äúadult.‚Äù) It‚Äôs not just <em>Born Again</em>‚Äôs visceral combat and ferocious language but also its thematic concerns as the inexorable pull of violence condemns its leads, all delivered with whip-smart writing and meticulous subtlety. But one thing it <em>isn‚Äôt</em> is an allegory for the re-rise of Donald Trump.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>(Note on spoilers: I‚Äôve deliberately written this not to spoil any significant story beats in the show, including the widely discussed major events from the first episode, but I obviously have to cover generalities.)</p><p><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> (<em>DBA</em>) is now six episodes into its run of nine, Disney+ adding two new episodes this week, and while it‚Äôs fair to say it‚Äôs suffering from that perennial Marvel TV issue of trying to stretch too little story across its run, it‚Äôs utterly compelling television.</p><p>As lawyer Matt Murdock aka Daredevil, Charlie Cox has developed his performance from the earlier Netflix seasons to something far subtler, exuding this extraordinarily purposeful quietness, the composure that allows his superheroic fighting abilities  channeled into his speech. Whether convincing a jury in court or calmly establishing authority during a bank robbery, he neither performatively whispers nor shouts, but instead maintains a timbre that‚Äôs just quiet enough that people are forced to listen. It‚Äôs spellbinding.</p><p>Meanwhile, human chameleon Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio returns to the role of Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin, with a similarly more moderate tone, without losing any of the power or fear that he commands. Fisk, who was seriously injured in sibling MCU TV show <em>Hawkeye</em>, returns to New York to attempt to pivot to politics, at the same time learning that his marriage is in serious trouble, and his control over the city‚Äôs crime is in tatters. Everything that stabilizes him, gives him the certainty of power he requires, is threatened, and yet D‚ÄôOnofrio and the creative team behind the show have the wisdom to underplay this magnificently. We know he‚Äôs quiet-quiet-quiet before <em>exploding</em>, that‚Äôs his nature, but this time the rumbling feels so much more unnerving, and the contained explosions so much darker.</p><p>One of the core plots of the first season of <em>DBA</em> is Fisk becoming the mayor of New York, and the sometimes comic, sometimes abhorrent conflicts this raises for a man more used to performing his corruption and violence in the open. This known criminal, this man people know was Kingpin, takes a populist position in a politically fraught city to gain political power, but then realizes his victory brings with it a requirement to perform the expected role. And in this, many have reasonably leapt to draw the obvious similarity between this and Donald Trump‚Äôs being president. A known criminal who has been openly corrupt for decades gaining political power. It seems clear.</p><p>As a result, multiple reviews and opinion pieces have been written drawing out the common themes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/03/daredevil-born-again-review-1236309328/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/daredevil-born-again-review-1236309328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many praising Disney‚Äôs boldness</a></span> in addressing this face on, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fandomwire.com/an-absolute-trump-analogy-daredevil-born-again-isnt-breaking-any-new-ground-with-kingpin-and-the-schtick-is-now-getting-boring/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fandomwire.com/an-absolute-trump-analogy-daredevil-born-again-isnt-breaking-any-new-ground-with-kingpin-and-the-schtick-is-now-getting-boring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others condemning it for being too easy</a></span>. But, while it absolutely had to be on the minds of the writers and producers, I‚Äôm not at all convinced that there was any desire for this text to be a piece of commentary or satire on this matter. It falls down in such a significant way that, if it were intentional commentary, would suggest an ignorance on the part of the creators that isn‚Äôt evidenced anywhere else in the show: Fisk isn‚Äôt an idiot.</p><figure id="" data-id="5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-recommend-id="image://5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1572" data-height="885" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-recommend-id="image://5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1572" data-height="885" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It‚Äôs worth noting immediately that <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>showrunner Dario Scardapane has already denied the allegory, albeit for the somewhat tenuous reason that the script was already written and the show mostly filmed ‚Äúlong before‚Äù 2024. (Those with long memories will remember Trump was president once before.) In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kr85lr7270&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kr85lr7270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video interview with <em>IGN</em></a></span> (that <em>is</em> packed with spoilers), Scardapane explains that Fisk‚Äôs ability to win an election despite his widely known criminal past is largely to do with New York‚Äôs turning on superheroes, and Fisk‚Äôs figurehead position as a person of power promising to stand against them. If anything, it was his legitimacy as a dangerous man of enormously cunning influence that gave him the edge. And those really aren‚Äôt words that sensibly apply to Trump.</p><p>While I am skeptical of Scardapane‚Äôs claims that he didn‚Äôt consider Trump‚Äôs original rise to power <em>at all</em>, instead saying it was simply the continuation of a plot written by others in 2016, I do genuinely believe that he‚Äôs smart enough  to know a person as intelligent and conniving as Fisk couldn‚Äôt be a meaningful allegory, <em>and</em> smart enough not to say that in an interview.</p><p>But without the words of the author, it‚Äôs plain to see. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> is a series about two men desperately fighting not to put their masks back on. That‚Äôs the core of everything that happens, every strand of plot we see. It is a show about two addicts doing everything they can to overcome their urges, while the world around them is doing everything <em>it</em> can to force them back down. Both are desperately clever men, blessed with everything they need to succeed in their respective fields, and yet beholden to an alter-ego that not only affords them shortcuts to all their goals, but satisfies a dark, awful bloodlust that lies within them.</p><p>Trump is just an idiot.

The difference is, one is being mendacious and manipulative, while the other just says stuff out loud and then latches on to the comments that get the loudest cheers. Fisk recognizes that following the atrocities that have visited New York since the advent of superheroes, he can exploit the anti-hero rhetoric to his own ends, given his own self-motivated reasons to have those who might stop his crime eliminated. Trump recognizes that his base cheers louder when he says he‚Äôs against abortion rather than for it, so switches to that view accordingly. One is directive, one is reactive. One is smart, one is dumb.</p><p>As such, reading <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> as a satirical reaction to Trump‚Äôs presidency relies on assuming the creative team behind the show are also stupid, too stupid to notice any of the above. And they‚Äôre clearly not! And that‚Äôs largely demonstrated in just how little of the program is occupied by exploring the means by which Fisk was able to become mayor. <em>DBA</em> is far more fixated on far more interesting things, most especially how Fisk can suppress his alter-ego in order to achieve his wider aims‚Äîsomething that makes the reveal at the end of episode five so much more interesting than simply, ‚ÄúOh, what a scamp!‚Äù Instead, it demonstrates the externalizing of his basest needs, <em>literally</em> taking prisoner his all-consuming need for harm and vengeance. If a Trump allegory were desired, he‚Äôd instead just be using his spare time looking around going ‚ÄúDoy doy‚Äù and watching TV.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/gran-turismo-7-gets-an-npc-upgrade-with-improved-gt-sophy-ai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>GT Sophy can now race at 19 tracks, up from the nine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/almost-unbeatable-ai-is-now-a-permanent-feature-of-gran-turismo-7/">that were introduced</a> in November 2023. The AI agent is an alternative to the regular, dumber AI in the game's quick race mode, with easy, medium, and hard settings. But now, at those same tracks, you can also create custom races using GT Sophy, meaning you're no longer limited to just two or three laps. You can enable things like damage, fuel consumption and tire wear, and penalties, and you can have some control over the cars you race against.</p>


<p>Unlike the time-limited demo, the hardest setting is no longer alien-beating. As a <em>GT7</em> player, I'm slowing with age, and I find the hard setting to be that‚Äîhard, but beatable. (I suspect but need to confirm that the game tailors the hardest setting to your ability based on your results, as, when I create a custom race on hard, only seven of the nine progress bars are filled, and in the screenshot above, only five bars are filled.)</p>
<p>Having realistic competition has always been one of the tougher challenges for a racing game, and one that the <em>GT</em> franchise was never particularly great at during previous console generations. This latest version of GT Sophy does feel different to race against: The AI is opportunistic and aggressive but also provokable into mistakes. If only the developer would add it to more versions of the in-game N√ºrburgring.</p>

James does the silly pictures and the music and Will does all the work (on the computer). We write everything together and voice a couple of characters each, too.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/pentiment-director-explains-how-going-all-in-on-fonts-helped-elevate-the-medieval-detective-rpg-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Pentiment director explains how going all-in on fonts helped elevate the medieval Detective RPG.</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will studied game design at Uni whereas James comes from an animation background. Really, neither of us have professional experience in the industry; we just got together one weekend and decided to make something fun. It has been the longest weekend of our lives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was more a case of slowly arriving at it. The original 'next game' idea we had after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Good Time Garden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was very different and didn't have a central player character and or specific location, being more focused on a visual style and loose concepts we wanted to explore. When we sat down to 'design' it, the characters naturally had our tone of voice (and accents), so the whole thing shifted gradually towards being set in a Northern English town and having a focus on the quirks and colloquialisms of that place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We used Unity for the engine, Photoshop for the pictures, and Fmod for the noises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The town of Barnsworth is filled with all sorts of wild, wacky people who have things for you to do (or at least promise some sort of silly interaction). What challenges did you face in creating an entire city crammed full of silly things to do and funny people to meet?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why your next game needs a babygirl</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be honest, the most difficult part is deciding how you actually interact with the characters. Because the player character serves as a kind of straight man for the comedy, it was difficult to know when their interactions with the townsfolk felt too involved. Also, because of the fairly flat visual presentation, it was tough to signal to the player who and what is important in a scene at any given moment. I think we circumnavigated this issue by making the whole thing a sort of send up of fetch quests, which meant we could be fairly hamfisted with 'briefing' the player.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, it was hard (and dumb!) to draw that many characters without reusing any assets.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What was your process for creating a character and the funny things that would happen around them? Your process for cramming similar humor into the player's interactions with the world and the things they see in it?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our approach to development is comedy first, and then tease out 'gameplay' from those bits. So, it usually involves us both drinking 4 tins of Stella a piece and screaming obscenities in a room until one of us says something funny (usually Will). We write good stuff in the pub. But then sometimes there might be a particular visual composition we‚Äôd like to explore, or a particular setting, and things are built out from there.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/uc-santa-cruz-professor-roleplays-gig-economy-publisher-negotiation-and-layoffs-with-game-design-students" target="_self" data-discover="true">UC Santa Cruz professor roleplays gig economy, publisher negotiation, and layoffs with game design students</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the game's art style? What drew you to this animated, playful style? How did you create an art style that seems designed to enhance the humor of the game? That also made some of the more unsettling or gross elements just feel light and fun?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The artwork is just James‚Äô style so it didn‚Äôt go through a ton of development because it was already developed. In many ways, the game serves the art style rather than the other way around. It would be a very different, probably more restrictive, experience if everything was written up top and then an artist came in and brought it to life.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have the slap/smack be the main way of interacting with things in the game's world?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a hangover from our first exploration into games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Good Time Garden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a short surreal interactive experience we made around our day jobs. We knew we wanted quite a ‚Äòpure‚Äô gameplay experience, (no UI, no dialogue boxes, no complicated control scheme), and, as we knew there wouldn‚Äôt be any gameplay in the traditional sense, it made sense to find a non-diegetic interactive button. Slap was the simplest and funniest.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the music, sound effects, and voices that would further increase the fun and humor? How did you make this game sound fun and appealing with these elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the sound, we worked with some lovely folks from A Shell in the Pit, and together we decided that the visual style and tone of voice of the game spoke for themselves, so it was funnier to make the SFX more realistic rather than slapstick. Similarly, the ambience is quite true to life, which hopefully grounds the player a little among the chaos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The music was difficult, if it was too sentimental it undermined the comedy and left some of the scenes feeling a bit too tragic, but if it was too upbeat we were in danger of things feeling corny. Hopefully we found a nice balance. It‚Äôs a bit of a blend between old British Music Hall stuff, Brass Bands, and a little Rocksteady.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A great deal of effort must go into the animations and creating so many layered jokes throughout the world. How did you keep this game's scope from spiraling out of control as you created more and more layers to it? How did you keep things focused and keep your capabilities as a team in mind while creating the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This being our first proper project meant we were both dramatically under-qualified, but also stupid enough to think we could deliver, which I suppose we did, albeit 3 years over schedule. But that meant that we didn‚Äôt really have a clue what the game was going to look like until right near the end. It meant the game‚Äôs scope fluctuated massively throughout development, and it was a real struggle to nail down a coherent story or narrative.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Difficulties arose because the whole thing is functionally a sketch show you can play, but without the luxury of being able to cut to a completely new scene/time/location at a whim. Instead, we had to write a sketch show, and then figure out a way for the viewer to travel between sketches in a consistent, intuitive, but still entertaining, way. Also, the player is part of the sketch show, also the whole thing‚Äôs animated, also the player can walk away from the sketches and decide instead to slap a bin basically whenever they want. Nightmare.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anyway, towards the end of the project we really started to get a handle on what was important and found the balance between bin slapping and bits.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date" rel="nofollow">February's Version 3.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", is set to launch across all platforms on April 9th. HoYoverse is promising "trials of survival and political intrigue" as part of the update's main story.</p>

<p>You'll be traveling to the "forgotten city-state of Styxia" in this update, and while you're there, you'll take on Pollux, a leviathan who slumbers in the River of Souls. Pollux has some pretty nasty HP manipulation attacks, so you'll have to be on your A-game.</p>

The first, Castorice, is a Remembrance-path character who can sync up with her Netherwing dragon for big damage, although the dragon sacrifices its own HP to use its ultimate attack.</p>

<p>Your second 5-star character in Version 3.2 is Anaxa, an Erudition character who can apply Weaknesses to enemies and boost his damage using his Qualitative Disclosure ability.</p>

<p>The first half of Version 3.2 will also see the return of Fugue, Jiaoqiu, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-acheron-raiden-shogun" rel="nofollow">Acheron</a> as rerun banners, while the second half will give you another chance to obtain the wonderfully-named <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-dr-ratio-trailer" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ratio</a> for your team.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 isn't all about gloomy city-states and frantic combat, though; you can also kick back and enjoy the new Seal Slammers minigame, which allows you to compete against your allies "in chaotic seal-based collisions". Finally.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PS5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", arrives on April 9th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/637898/nvidia-rtx-5090-laptop-gpu-impressions-benchmarks-testing-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia‚Äôs 50-series desktop GPUs have been off to a slightly rocky start, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">quality control issues</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">underwhelming performance</a> gains over last generation, and the occasional <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">melting cable</a>. Its new laptop GPUs, led by the flagship RTX 5090, may be on a similarly modest trajectory, but with one added benefit for laptop gamers: efficiency.</p><p>I‚Äôve been testing the RTX 5090 laptop GPU in Razer‚Äôs new Blade 16 laptop, which Nvidia is using as a showcase for its top-tier mobile card. My time with it has been more limited than I‚Äôd hoped, since my first review unit exhibited some strange graphical anomalies and was prone to blue-screen crashes during basic productivity tasks. Nvidia sent me a replacement, but I‚Äôve had less than two days with it as of press time. From what I‚Äôve seen so far, it is indeed a little faster than the mobile 4090, but like the desktop 50-series cards, its biggest improvements are in DLSS and Multi Frame Generation, rather than raw performance.</p><p>The new mobile <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Flaptops%2F50-series%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DSpecs-%2CGEFORCE%2520RTX%25205090%2520LAPTOP%2520GPU%2C-GEFORCE%2520RTX%25205080" rel="sponsored">RTX 5090</a> has 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM instead of the 16GB of GDDR6 found on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Flaptops%2Fcompare%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DGeForce%2520RTX%25204090%2520Laptop%2520GPU" rel="sponsored">4090</a>. It‚Äôs also got more powerful Tensor cores, slightly more CUDA cores, and an extra hardware video encoder for better livestreaming and video exports, but the same 175W TDP.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>We‚Äôll have more to say about the laptop housing this new GPU soon.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The 5090‚Äôs specs translate to small gains over the 4090 in synthetic benchmarks, such as a 13 percent higher Geekbench GPU score and a 14 percent higher score in 3DMark‚Äôs standard Time Spy test at 2560 x 1440 resolution.</p><p>To test the 5090‚Äôs uplift in actual games, I ran an array of benchmarks using <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> ‚Äî at the native 2560 x 1600 of both Blade 16s and at 4K on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034953/ces-2024-verge-awards-best-tv-laptop-monitor-gaming-car#:~:text=Best%20monitor-,Alienware%20AW3225QF,-Dell%E2%80%99s%20Alienware%20AW3225QF">Alienware AW3225QF</a> monitor. The biggest difference I saw was in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 2.5K resolution and Ultra settings without DLSS, frame generation, or ray tracing enabled. There, the 5090 was 24 percent faster than the 4090. That sounds great, but once you enable ray tracing and DLSS 4 (something most people would likely do on either of these laptops), it narrows to a delta of just 5 percent. When you enable 2x frame generation, the 5090 is 14 percent faster than the 4090, and going all out with 4x Multi Frame Gen more than doubles what the 4090 can do at 2x frame gen. If you‚Äôre playing at 4K, the 5090 still wins, but the gap narrows to within single digits.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Benchmark</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 4090 average fps @ 4K</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 5090 average fps @ 4K</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 4090 average fps @ 2.5K</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 5090 average fps @ 2.5K</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong TSR</td><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>45</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR</td><td>41</td><td>43</td><td>62</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR Frame Gen</td><td>35</td><td>39</td><td>54</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS</td><td>46</td><td>48</td><td>68</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS Frame Gen</td><td>66</td><td>70</td><td>104</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra</td><td>41</td><td>48</td><td>74</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; FSR 3.1 Quality</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>63</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT FSR Frame Gen</td><td>61</td><td>70</td><td>118</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS quality</td><td>39</td><td>40</td><td>64</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x2</td><td>67</td><td>70</td><td>103</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>123</td><td>N/A</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT no DLSS</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>21</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra &amp; DLSS Quality</td><td>23</td><td>25</td><td>39</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x2</td><td>43</td><td>45</td><td>67</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>83</td><td>N/A</td><td>147</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, on the other hand, is a little less forgiving. In this graphically demanding Souls-adjacent RPG, the 5090 is only a few percent faster than the 4090. The highest average the 5090 could muster was 111fps at 2.5K with DLSS and standard frame generation, with the 4090 wasn‚Äôt far behind at 104. If <em>Wukong</em> supported Multi Frame Generation, the 5090 could no doubt separate itself further, but that would likely <a href="https://youtu.be/xpzufsxtZpA?si=09GBCKtpAafpCCRZ&amp;t=668">add a couple extra milliseconds of latency</a>. Most people will never notice or care about that, but some players may feel any latency added to their pinpoint dodge-roll timing is a nonstarter.</p><p>Like the 50-series desktop cards, the 5090 laptop GPU looks its best in games that support DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Over 100 games now support Nvidia‚Äôs highlight feature, and you can also use override settings in the Nvidia app to force it in unsupported games. </p><p>Frame generation, which both Nvidia and AMD offer, uses AI models to generate extra frames and insert them between traditionally rendered frames. This gives the appearance of smoother gameplay but doesn‚Äôt improve input latency ‚Äî and actually increases it slightly. AMD and previous Nvidia cards can do 2x frame generation; the 50 series can do up to 4x. There‚Äôs an ongoing debate in the world of PC gaming about these ‚Äúfake frames‚Äù ‚Äî some folks are perfectly content with AI upscaling and generated frames, and others view it as a band-aid solution with too many compromises to image quality and game feel. I think it depends on your personal experience, what kinds of games you like to play and what you‚Äôre used to playing them on, and even whether you have an eye (or even a care) for this stuff. It can be great for the right games, and it may even make more sense on a 16-inch laptop screen than a jumbo 4K monitor right in front of your face. </p><p>I forced Multi Frame Generation on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em></a>, and I was pleasantly surprised with its performance and buttery smoothness on ultra settings. <em>Shadows </em>is maybe a perfect example of a single-player game where frame generation is a nonissue. It‚Äôs got dodge rolling, but it‚Äôs not the kind of game that really requires frame-perfect timing. It felt A-okay to me, and boy did feudal Japan look lovely on a 2.5K OLED at an average of 167fps.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Many of those frames may be ‚Äúfake,‚Äù but they sure are pretty.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The obvious games to avoid with frame generation are competitive shooters. While I felt fine playing <em>Marvel Rivals</em> on the 5090 with 4x frame generation reaching nearly 200fps, I was playing pretty casually with a hero that doesn‚Äôt require precision accuracy. For something like <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, I‚Äôd advise against it. But to be fair, those ultra-competitive games typically have a low performance barrier for entry and practically run on a potato.</p><p>One area where the 5090 does seem significantly better so far is power efficiency. In our benchmarks, the new GPU had a lower average wattage, by 20 to 29 percent, than the 4090. That should help improve battery life when playing games away from a power cord.</p><div><h2>GPU power (watts) at 2.5K</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Benchmarks</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 4090 average GPU wattage</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 5090 average GPU wattage</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong TSR</td><td>174</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR</td><td>171</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR Frame Gen</td><td>145</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS</td><td>170</td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS Frame Gen</td><td>163</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra</td><td>159</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; FSR 3.1 quality</td><td>153</td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT FSR Frame Gen</td><td>154</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Quality</td><td>154</td><td>126</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x2</td><td>162</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT no DLSS</td><td>169</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra &amp; DLSS quality</td><td>167</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x2</td><td>167</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full UltraA RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>133</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Lower wattages can also mean lower temperatures, as I was able to play games with the plugged-in laptop on my actual lap and not toast my legs. But this also hinges on an individual laptop‚Äôs thermal design and how well it cools ‚Äî the Blade 16 so far seems to do it well, but it‚Äôs also a totally different design than the 2024 model with the 4090 in it. Of course, you‚Äôre not going to see the same level of performance when running graphically intensive games on battery power. I‚Äôll have to test this more to see how much of a difference it makes in real-world usage.</p><p>The RTX 5090 is Nvidia‚Äôs most powerful and expensive laptop GPU, and you can expect to pay $4,000 or more for a laptop that runs it. The Blade 16 review configuration costs <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05289EN4-R3U1" rel="sponsored">$4,499.99</a>. It shows some promise for games that support DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation, and maybe for gaming that‚Äôs not always tethered to a wall. But if I were shopping right now, I wouldn‚Äôt ignore a heavy discount on a laptop with an RTX 4090. (The 4090 desktop supply, on the other hand, has dried up.)</p><p>We‚Äôll continue to test the RTX 5090, as well as the rest of the 50-series mobile GPUs as they appear in new gaming laptop models over the next few weeks and months. I‚Äôm looking forward to testing the RTX 5080, in particular, and seeing if that‚Äôs the sweet spot for laptop gamers.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <p>Toby Fox's cult RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a> is getting a one-night-only live orchestral concert event to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>The Determination Symphony, as it is known, will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on 22nd June, and act as a celebration of all things Undertale.</p>
<p>Undertale originally made its way into our hearts and minds back in 2015. It tells the story of a child who tumbles into the Underground, a strange world beneath the Earth's surface.</p>

<p>During the concert, patrons will also be able to "fall into the Underground" (although, I assume metaphorically and emotionally here, rather than literally) all while being accompanied by a live orchestra, which will be performing arrangements of the game's soundtrack alongside on-screen gameplay.</p>

<p>For those interested, tickets to The Determination Symphony will be available on Friday 28th March, and can be purchased at <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/">www.eventimapollo.com</a>. </p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-music-played-at-the-popes-latest-audience">wonder if The Pope will show up</a>?</p>
<p>As for the game, here is what Eurogamer's former editor in chief Martin Robinson said when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-review">he reviewed the PlayStation Vita version of Undertale</a> back in 2017:</p>
<p>"Undertale dances happily in the footsteps of Shigesato Itoi's Mother series, and like those games before it, it's a JRPG that's endlessly playful and inventive."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-desert-console-getting-native-ps5-xss-x-versions-on-june-26-dropping-ps4-xbox-one/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Pearl Abyss announced that Black Desert console will be updated with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously confirmed</a> native versions for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X consoles on June 26. The community had been waiting a long time; it has been well over four years since those consoles launched, after all. The caveat is that the game won't be playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One anymore after that date.</p>
<p>The General Manager <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YlGGwrWCBU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>Black Desert console was first introduced in 2019 with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and this month <a href="https://wccftech.com/cross-play-between-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-now-live-in-black-desert-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the fifth anniversary of crossplay</a>. In our previous commentary video, we've mentioned that we are preparing for a native gen port with the goal of releasing an update in the first half of this year. We'd like to share that platform certification for both PlayStation 5 and Xbox series versions is progressing as planned. While there is a possibility of some schedule changes depending on the certification status, if all processes are completed smoothly, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions will be available on June 26.</em></p>
<p><em>As mentioned previously, the update will be provided at no additional cost while we are excited to bring this update to our community. Following the porting update, Black Desert console will be transitioning to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service. Consequently, gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available. Rest assured your game data will be safely stored your account information and all entitlements to Black Desert will be fully accessible when you're ready to transition to the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series version of your console.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you. However, as we mentioned in </em><em>our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly </em><em>difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly. We kindly ask for your understanding and </em><em>offer our sincerest apologies for this decision that is made with the long-term growth of Black Desert console in mind. </em></p>
<p><em>We believe that the transition to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service will be an important first step in providing a better gaming environment from Black Desert console. </em><em>Performance improvements involve many different factors, so it might be difficult to notice immediate changes in old areas but we will continue working to address the limitations experienced on the older generation consoles. Furthermore, we are planning updates for</em><br>
<em>various content that you have all been waiting for.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, but don't get too excited; its release is a couple of years away yet.</p>

<p>Per an announcement on the new Nintendo Today! app, which was announced (and released) as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Nintendo Direct show</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie will launch around the world on March 26th, 2027.</p>

<p>That date puts the movie's release in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">Paramount's&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>; March is a pretty common month for blockbuster-style movies to be released in, so these two tentpole video game adaptations releasing then makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=2i6awzrx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=ETg0uIP1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie has an official release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, just because Nintendo has announced a date for the movie, that doesn't mean it won't be delayed or changed later down the line. Still, now you know when you should be clearing your schedule if you're eagerly awaiting the film.</p>

<p>While we don't have a cast or a story outline for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie yet, we do know that it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-announces-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-distributed-and-co-financed-by" rel="nofollow">co-produced by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, alongside Hollywood blockbuster producer Avi Arad, whose name you'll find on movies like&nbsp;Sam Raimi's&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>films.</p>

<p>Additionally, attached to direct the project is&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner</em>'s Wes Ball, who also directed and produced 2024's&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll hear more about what's coming for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie in the months ahead, but Nintendo no doubt won't feel the need to rush; after all, it's got a major console launch to take care of in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=WxqjCGIm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=D0J14GfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo will likely take care of the Switch 2's launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're unaware, Nintendo is gearing up to release the Switch 2, which will probably be launching sometime in summer. A Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to air next week</a>.</p>

<p>It's likely the company will be looking to focus on that launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed, but it looks like if more info is released soon, it'll probably be via the Nintendo Today! app. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p><span>The game that changed everything for me on PC.</span></p>
		</div>
	<div>
		<p>My mom loves to tell the story that one of the reasons they were able to start sleeping through the night when I was a few years old was because I would get up in the middle of the night, put a <em>Sesame Street</em> tape in the VHS player, and put myself to bed when it was over. When they were confused about how to use the VHS player, they would inevitably ask their kid for advice.</p><p>This dynamic only escalated over time.</p><p><a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/new-system-old-me/">Rob wrote a piece last week</a> about the ritual he undergoes when buying a new PC, but ritual requires repetition. I‚Äôve owned PCs over the years, but my relationship with PCs is mostly defined by large gaps in-between when I last owned one. It wouldn‚Äôt occur to run an old game and see how it runs on the new PC, because that requires me knowing how it originally ran.</p><p>My dad loved to buy new tech, but it was always on <em>me</em> to figure out how it worked while he would stand over my shoulder. We were, for example, one of the first to have a computer in my neighborhood. I can‚Äôt tell you what brand the machine was, other than it was a 486 66 machine that ran DOS. (We later owned a Compaq, but I‚Äôm fairly sure it was the machine <em>after</em> this?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once we had the PC, my dad wanted to buy some software for it. There was a CompUSA near us at the time, but this was a different store. <a href="https://www.cepro.com/audio-video/10-failed-electronic-retailers/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Despite my best attempts to jog my memory</u></a>, I can‚Äôt remember it! But when we walked in, there was a massive standee for <em>Doom II: Hell on Earth</em>, and my dad could tell my eyes were drawn to it. For whatever reason, he decided to buy it, too.</p><p>That game was so fucking cool, and was unlike <em>anything</em> I‚Äôd played on a console. This was an era where whole genres of games didn‚Äôt even exist there. A shooter was like witnessing God for the first time, and I later had a similar revelation when <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> came out.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>At one point, when we upgraded to a new computer, my brother and I did our first "LAN party" and connected the two machines so that we could play </span><i><em>Red Alert </em></i><span>multiplayer.</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was the computer where I figured out how to do line-by-line memory management, so I could play games like <em>Dark Forces</em>. I‚Äôd write down the exact order of operations on a sticky note.</p><p>Some years later, Windows 3.1 was available and my dad eventually picked up a copy. I‚Äôm sure the installation process was <em>supposed</em> to be straightforward, but Windows 3.1 came out in the early 90s and I was not even 10 years old. The result of one of my first fights with my dad, as we tried to figure out the instruction manual. Bickering and tears later, we‚Äôd installed Windows.</p>
