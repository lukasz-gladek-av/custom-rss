            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.walesinteractive.com/">Wales Interactive</a>, a studio you might recognize for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/maid-of-sker-hotel-evil/">Maid of Sker</a>, Sker Ritual, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wales-interactive-reveals-fmv-game-i-saw-black-clouds/">I Saw Black Clouds</a>, is ramping up to the launch of its next FMV title, Dead Reset, which it's just revealed is due to launch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-reset-release-date-ps5-xbox-nintendo-pc/">September 11, 2025, on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC</a>. Ahead of that launch, I got to check out the first chapter of the game to get a taste of what's to come across the rest of the interactive horror film.</p>



<p>Now, I do want to be clear that I've only played through the first chapter as part of a preview build. The full game is eight chapters long, and across it, players will make more than 280 choices, have the potential to see 340 video sequences, in seven different locations, and uncover four different endings. I've seen only a fraction of what's to come in Dead Reset, but if the rest of the game is anything like what the first chapter introduces, then I fear some horror fans (me, I'm some horror fans) are in for a disappointing time.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole is being restrained by Slade after just resetting</figcaption></figure>



<p>A fun time, don't get me wrong, and certainly the right kind of horror fan will have no issue with what Dead Reset has to offer, but at least a bit of a disappointing one in my book. </p>



<p>I want to start out by saying I love horror. Whether its video games, films, TV shows, books, comics, whatever, I'm always going to be up for a scary time. I love that horror can run the gamut between being shallow, gore-riddled for the sake of gore, half comedic jump scares and silly plots, to serious, theme and/or character-driven stories that are as deep as they are terrifying. It's the genre that, for my money, has pushed art forward more often than any other genre, where creators are still innovating, and where the biggest swings are taken from a risk perspective.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole backs up against a desk while hiding from the creature</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dead Reset, at least based on this introduction, is not that kind of innovative, risk-taking horror story. It's a pretty surface-level, hammed-up horror story that mashes time loops with parasitic aliens, as if the concept started with the idea to combine the 1993 film Groundhog Day with 1982's The Thing. It's a creature-feature, which isn't inherently a bad thing; it just seems to lack the kind of depth I've seen in other horror works, which is what makes me excited for every new entry in the genre.</p>



<p>You play as Cole, a surgeon who is stuck in a time loop that resets when he dies, and for the first few times you die, it resets to him on the floor of a facility, before being rudely picked up by a security guard named Slade, and told by a woman named Magason that he must perform surgery on a woman (who we soon learn is named Amanda) and remove a "<em>foreign specimen"</em> from her abdomen. That foreign specimen is the creature, whose name remains unknown for now, and whose design seems to really be leaning into comparisons to The Thing, save for morphing into copycats of the people around it. </p>

</figure>



<p>That design is part of what makes Dead Reset feel pretty hammed-up, especially when you see it attack the surrounding characters for the first time. The deaths were comical, with any tension built up to that point shattered by a mound of flesh that is the creature sliding around and jumping at everyone in the room, and watching the actors do their best to hold it to their neck or stomach while pretending to fight back, with a blood-spouting gash left behind that, admittedly, does not look very realistic.</p>



<p>From there, Dead Reset struggled to build up any more tension, especially considering that some of your deaths were entirely scripted, without a choice to be made before you died, either from being shot, getting killed by the creature, or a bit of both. There is a layer of mystery to be discovered, specifically around how exactly the time travel works, what the creature is, and why Magason has the same kind of drive to keep it alive that synthetics working for Weyland have for catching and breeding Xenomorphs.</p>



<p>It took me an hour to get through the first chapter, dying seven times before making it to the end of the chapter on my eighth run. While the performances and the various blood spats were fun to watch in that hour, and the rest of the story's mystery is set up nicely, I couldn't help but feel disappointed for reasons that, ultimately, came down to my own expectations and hopes. I wanted something more than a popcorn horror, and Dead Reset is more of a popcorn horror FMV game. At least that's how it introduces itself anyway.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cooper screams after being splashed with blood. Image credit: Wales Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>I could, of course, be wrong about the final product and how the story will shape up over the other seven chapters included in the full release. This is, after all, just chapter one, and everything could take a deeper, darker turn as we learn more about the creature and how time travel works, why Cole is having his visions, and why his visions seem connected to the creature. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Previews are always an incomplete picture, so we'll see if there's more depth to be found in the next seven chapters, and if not, if Dead Reset is able to appropriately deliver on being an entertaining and popcorn-level horror story.</p>

                <p>Microsoft achieved a $4 trillion market cap, becoming just the second company ever to reach that valuation. Microsoft is now the No. 2 most valuable company on the planet, trailing only Nvidia. The climbing valuation comes just after Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">laid off 9,000+ people, including major cuts at Xbox</a>.</p><p>Microsoft reported earnings on Wednesday, and the company beat expectations. The company's stock price jumped after that, helping push Microsoft's total valuation above $4 trillion. The stock price has since cooled off, dropping Microsoft back below $4 trillion but still ranking No. 2 overall. Microsoft is currently trading at around $538 per share, which is up 28% year-to-date and up 163% over the past five years.</p><p>The top five companies on the planet ranked by market cap include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, in that order.</p><p>Microsoft brought in revenue of $76.4 billion for the quarter that ended June 30, along with a profit of $27.2 billion. For the Xbox business, Microsoft reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">annual Game Pass revenue reached nearly $5 billion for the first time</a>, with 50 million people trying Black Ops 6. Additionally, Microsoft said Xbox had <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1950675193644392619" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">500 million monthly active users</a> across all platforms, covering console, PC, mobile, and more.</p><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on an earnings call that Microsoft is the "top publisher" on both Xbox and PlayStation. Newly published US video game sales data showed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games are dominating the PlayStation sales charts.</a></p><p>Looking ahead, Microsoft plans to invest even more in AI infrastructure and technology than before, with Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/andrewrsorkin/status/1950717933774385623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">upping its planned investment from $80 billion to $120 billion.</a></p><p>Nadella acknowledged in a memo to staff that people may wonder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-microsofts-ceo-told-employees-about-ai-and-future-of-company-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533420/" data-ref-id="1100-6533420">why Microsoft is laying off thousands of people as its business thrives</a>. He said, "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value."</p><p>For Xbox, Microsoft's cuts included not only layoffs but game cancellations and the closure of at least one studio.

                <p>While today's Nintendo Partner Direct wrapped up with a couple of Square Enix reveals, there was one more announcement from the RPG maker that only made an appearance in the Japanese version of the Direct. As detailed on an <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq3/faq/en.html" rel="nofollow ">FAQ page</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-532331">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">free Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade</a>, though it doesn't sound like a particularly big one.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the FAQ, the update includes "Graphical improvements which make the game appear sharper and smoother," and "Additional options which allow players to prioritize frame rate or graphics." It also stressed that "No changes have been made to the story or which items can be obtained in the game," so it really does just sound like a case of making the game look a bit prettier and run a bit better on Switch 2. The update is available today.</p>

<p>Coming to Switch 1 &amp; 2 September</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It was only a matter of time until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pac-man_world_2">Pac-Man World 2</a> got the remake treatment, and today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase confirmed the inevitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> is coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>. Based on the PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube sequel to the PS1 original — which also got a remake a few years ago — you'll play through 25 levels across six themed "worlds" after Pac-Man's home is invaded by Ghosts, who have stolen the Golden Fruit.</p>
<p>The game will feature two-player co-op, a landing target for your jumps, and missions that will let you unlock costumes for the yellow puck. If you own the Pac-Man World Re-Pac remake, you'll also get a Toc-Man costume!</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are a bunch of pre-order bonuses too in the form of Team Ghost costumes and statues, and some collaboration DLC.</p>

Let us know if you're looking forward to this one down below!</em></p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

Gaming revenue for the company grew nine percent on the previous year, adding another $2 billion, “driven by growth in Xbox content and services, offset by a decline in Xbox hardware.” Even with falling console sales (down 25 percent), Microsoft saw colossal increases in income from its gaming, in the same year it chose to cancel multiple gaming projects, close down multiple studios, and lay off thousands of employees.</p><p>The document didn’t feel a need to mention all these closures in its celebration of an operating income of $34.3 billion, and instead stated, “We continue to invest in gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of first- and third-party titles.”</p><p>You’ll be relieved to learn that “the gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem,” according to the corporation. “We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores.”</p><p>Speaking on an accompanying earnings call, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-becomes-playstation-s-top-publisher-and-game-pass-revenue-nears-5-billion&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-becomes-playstation-s-top-publisher-and-game-pass-revenue-nears-5-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as reported by <em>Game Developer</em></a></span>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that Xbox Game Pass’s annual revenue totaled just under $5 billion, with 500 million active users, and “nearly” 40 games in development. He added, “We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay streamed via the cloud this year.”</p><p>One of those nearly 40 games isn’t <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the franchise reboot being developed by The Initiative.

            <p>It's been a couple of months now since Nintendo launched its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console, with its previous Direct stream in April detailing everything we needed to know about the new console.</p>
<p>Today's Nintendo Direct was the first since launch, and as a Partner Showcase it gave us a look at third-party games coming to Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>So while we didn't see the likes of Mario, Metroid, or Zelda, there were still plenty of exciting game announcements to check out.</p>
<p>Here's everything shown in today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.</p>

<p>The Direct got off to a cracking start with a splitting egg central to the story of Monster Hunter Stories 3. This will be the third in Capcom's RPG spin-off series that first began on 3DS. This trailer focused solely on story, but surely we can expect more extravagant turn-based battles too. It's due out on Switch 2 next year.</p>

As with versions on other consoles, it'll feature a revised UI, improved graphics, new difficulty options, and will be fully-voiced. It's a great opportunity to experience a cult classic of the series, with its more politically-leaning narrative. It's out on 30th September across both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>This new game in the Hyrule Warriors Zelda spin-off series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-is-getting-a-hyrule-warriors-sequel">revealed before the Switch 2's launch</a>, and here we got a fresh look at its gameplay. It will show the canonical events leading up to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (essentially, more of Zelda's storyline) and will have players controlling the Sages as well as the princess herself. It also seems to be hinting at some sort of robotic Link character. There's still no release date, but it's coming to Switch 2 this winter.</p>

Set between the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi films, it sees scoundrel Kay Vess fighting against The Empire. Performance doesn't look too hot from this trailer, though.</p>

<p>This is the latest horror game from Bloober Team, following its Silent Hill 2 remake. It sees players as The Traveller, exploring a desolate Polish city plagued with evil zombie-esque enemies that can merge together into new monstrosities. We knew it was coming to PS5, Xbox and PC, but now it's coming to Switch 2 too on 5th September. Our Ian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-feels-like-a-combination-of-every-other-survival-horror-game-ive-played-before-it-which-isnt-always-a-good-thing">previewed it recently but found it quite derivative</a>.</p>

<p>A cute looking game with a terrible name, The Adventures of Elliot is a new top-down HD-2D action-RPG from Square Enix. It mixes the visuals of Octopath Traveler with the gameplay of classic Zelda, and even features a main character with a fairy companion. The trailer shows combat with multiple weapon types - swords, bows, chains, and sickles - as well as boss battles and dungeon environments. There's a two-player mode to control Elliot and Faie together, too. It will launch on Switch 2 next year, but there's a demo out today if you want to give it a try.</p>

<p>Speaking of Octopath Traveler, a prequel is on the way to both Switch and Switch 2. It will once again feature HD-2D visuals and turn-based battles, as well as town-building mechanics. Players will start from zero (hence the name) and restore the realm through the eyes of a customisable protagonist. It's coming to both Switch consoles on 4th December this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Square Enix wasn’t content to reveal just one HD-2D game, and has also announced Octopath Traveler 0, a prequel to the title that originated this art style, which is coming to Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klKrQZXDWkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Embark on an adventure of your own creation,” reads the trailer blurb. “Start from zero in a quest of restoration and retribution! Confront powerful villains and rebuild your hometown in OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – a new entry in the HD-2D series.”</p>
<p>For the first time, you’ll be able to create your protagonist in this series, but will still be gathering a large party of fellows to journey with you.</p>
<p>There’s also a new town-building side to the game, which is glimpsed in just moments from the trailer, which could be really interesting.</p>

<p>We loved the last game in the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/17/octopath-traveler-2-review/">Octopath Traveler II</a>, with Reuben saying “Octopath Traveler II manages to improve on almost every aspect of its predecessor, whether they needed it or not. The exploration is deeper with more nooks and crannies to nose your way through. The combat is far more intricate, giving greater options to build your party and skillset, and a large degree of player choice. The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and the sound design is phenomenal once again. Honestly, Octopath Traveler II has basically negated the need to play the first title, and I cannot think of higher praise.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Square Enix also revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, a Switch 2 exclusive branch of the HD-2D visual style, embracing it for an action RPG.</p>

<p>Squad up, Switch 2 style!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>EA has just announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> will be receiving a Switch 2 upgrade next month, or rather next week, as it drops on August 5th. Hooray!</p>
<p>Yep, as part of today's very good/middling/awful (delete as appropriate) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/watch-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-live">Partner Direct</a>, we learned that the online squad-based shooter, which first launched all the way back in 2019 — when it singlehandedly invented pinging stuff for your mates in-game (maybe) — will hit Switch 2 next Tuesday.</p>
<p>It came to the original Switch in 2021, although it's far from the best place to ply it. The Switch 2 version will boast an enhanced resolution and better performance, according to the trailer, which you can check out above.</p>
<p>Of course, this dickied-up new version will also be released to coincide with the start of the game's 26th season of online murdering. How time flies!</p>

<p>Introducing, Elliot</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase was closed out by a pair of announcements from Square Enix: <strong>Octopath Traveler 0</strong>, and an all-new action RPG called <strong>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</strong>.</p>
<p>This is yet another HD-2D joint, which will see you playing as 'Elliot, the Adventurer' (badass name, that), who sets out across the fantasy land of Philabieldia to keep his kingdom safe.</p>
<p>Action seems to really be at the heart of this one, with seven weapon types at Elliot's disposal to take on foes and safely make it through the environment. You can even team up with a pal in co-op mode, and split your combat duties between the titular hero and his fairy companion, Faie.</p>
<p>We still don't have a precise release date for this one just yet outside of the '<strong>2026</strong>' window, though Square Enix did announce that a free demo will be available later today, with a player feedback survey coming shortly after.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Have you also forgotten the title already? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

			<p>IO Interactive and Feral Interactive have <a href="https://feralinteractive.com/en/news/?platform=ios&amp;game=hitmanabsolution">announced</a> that Hitman: Absolution will be making its way to handheld devices, with a mobile version of the 2012 game coming to iOS and Android later this fall, followed by a Nintendo Switch version before the end of 2025. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is also in the works, though that won't arrive until 2026.</p>



<p>Feral Interactive is the same porting house that brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-switch-better-ps4/">Alien: Isolation to the Nintendo Switch</a> with extremely impressive visuals, and the team who brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-blood-money-reprisal-is-sneaking-its-way-to-mobile-platforms-this-fall/">Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal</a> to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2023. This new version of Hitman: Absolution is the studio directly building off its mobile port of Blood Money.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer that debuted alongside the announcement shows how Feral Interactive is bringing the experience of Absolution onto your mobile devices, with full touchscreen controls, though the studio also clarifies that these versions will also support you plugging in a controller or keyboard and mouse, if you have the time and space for it. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you're keen to jump into Hitman: Absolution on mobile, then you can pre-order the game today for $14.99 / £9.99 / €12,49. You'll have to wait a little longer for pre-orders to go live on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, however. No specific release date for the mobile versions or the Nintendo Switch versions has been confirmed.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The next big patch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s now out there via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go">Steam testing client</a>, as devs Funcom look to test out its various tweaks before pressing go on full deployment next month. If you've been desperately screaming for the ability to slop out a bunch of blood and/or water at once, or have recently be chased by a swarm of griefy ornithopters, this is the patch for you.</p>
<p>In fact, the devs make clear that they'd really prefer it if you were to dedicate the bulk of your two-week-long patch testing time to those two things in particular. They're also turning off taxes and sandstorms, the latter very much being the tax equivalent of the natural world, for the first week so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-for-a-deep-desert-patch-mistake-that-lost-folks-bases-and-gear">bases won't be at risk</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The rundown of the notes for patch 1.1.20, naturally, starts off with these two changes. "Colliding ornithopters will now get an impulse applied to separate them," the devs wrote, "This will mitigate the griefing done to Carrier ornithopters by swarming with multiple ornithopters." So, no more getting crashed into by a gaggle of cheeky spice field seagulls, or pinned down by one until you get wormed, at the cost of not being able to have a friendly head-on wreck when you fancy it.</p>
<p>Funcom are even offering a free top-tier buggy, scout ornithopter, assault ornithopter, and carrier ornithopter to folks who've already been into the game's test client and created a character, so people have no excuse not to see how this tweak works. Instructions to claim them are in the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/public-test-client-version-1-1-20-0/">full notes here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the devs have finally added the option to deposit all of the blood and water you're carrying into purifiers and cisterns with one button press, something players have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">begging for since launch</a>. You can also take all of the water back out again with one button press, though not the blood, which earns a boo from me.</p>
<p>Among the other tweaks are things like the flour sand and spice sand fields in Hagga Basin being put in the path of sandworm danger, which is bad news for folks who've been taking advantage of the chance to gather those without having to worry about being Shai-Huluded. The worms have also been made slightly deadlier, as running into its body during any of its animations will now result in death or your vehicle going pop.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, the prices of melange spiced beer, spiced wine, spiced liquour, and also napalm are all among those lowered by the patch in an effort to make them more attractive to buy, so there's your next long weekend in the back garden of your base sorted.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, Funcom have ducked their heads around the door to <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/upcoming-change-to-pentashield-only-bases/">announce another change</a> they'll be making with this patch. They're making it illegal to build pentashields without proper support, so if you've erected one in that manner, here's your warning that it'll collapse once patch 1.1.20 goes live in full.</p>
<p>The devs are currently aiming to have that happen on August 12, so make sure you pin a note to your fridge.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-are-testing-a-patch-thatll-let-you-deposit-all-of-your-blood-and-should-help-tackle-ornithopter-griefing]]></content:encoded>

I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, the most direct inspiration for the <em>Octopath games</em>, at least a dozen times. But try as I may, my appreciation, admiration, and respect for the <em>Octopath</em> games has never given way to being truly in love with them. I play a bunch, mostly out of a feeling of duty, and then eventually bounce off. They can be nice JRPG comfort food but never felt like anything more to me. </p><p>  <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is definitely going to be the one to fix that though, I can feel it. This it the one that will convert me into a true believer rather than just a sympathetic skeptic. I will definitely <em>not</em> buy <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, play it for 10 hours, and then never put the game back in my Switch 2. This time will be different. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will fix me. I can’t wait to order it, gift wrap it, and leave it under the Christmas tree just waiting to not break my heart on Christmas Day. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-trailer-release-date-switch-2-1851787423]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As PopCap announces a "definitive" new version of its beloved original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/plants-vs-zombies">Plants vs Zombies</a>, the studio has reflected on the evolution of its garden tower defense franchise — and revealed why now is the right time for it to go back to the series' PC and console roots, after a pair of sequels focused on smartphones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, PopCap studio general manager Nick Reinhart said the freshly-announced Plants vs Zombies: Replanted was an opportunity to "reestablish" what fans loved about the series, while making it accessible on modern consoles, with polished-up 4K graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted will arrive on October 23, 2025 priced at $19.99, for PC (via EA app, Epic Games Store and Steam) and on consoles for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">New features include local co-op and PVP options, two additional game modes (a roguelike permadeath offering named Rest in Peace, and Cloudy Day mode, which ups the difficulty by limiting sunlight), plus an art gallery showing previously-unreleased concepts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing the package as "the definitive PvZ remaster," executive producer Jake Neri said it was PopCap's way to "preserve the magic of the original while also giving it a freshness that allows it to live for another 20-odd years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've heard for quite a while now that that people would love a remaster of this game," Neri continued, when asked why Replanted was surfacing now. "Timing is important."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PopCap just celebrated [PvZ's] Sweet 16, which may seem like a little bit of a strange one but, at PopCap, we are strange," added Reinhart. "It certainly has been swirling around sort of for a little bit, as we've been talking about getting things pulled together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replanted's announcement comes at an interesting time for the Plants vs Zombies franchise, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/18/plants-vs-zombies-3-in-development-pre-alpha-available-now">at least six years of work</a> by PopCap testing various versions of Plants vs Zombies 3 on smartphones. Finally released worldwide in January 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-takes-plants-vs-zombies-3-offline-for-major-overhaul">PvZ 3 was then taken offline in October 2024 for another "major overhaul"</a> — and, nearly a year later, it is still to resurface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My official answer here is that I don't have anything to say about PvZ 3 at the moment," Reinhart said when asked for an update on the MIA threequel's status. For 2025, at least, the franchise's focus appears to be Replanted — though there are "no plans" for Replanted to also launch on smartphones, something that would leave the runway clear for PvZ to return there at some point.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-bowlingminigame-1753890173475.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Is it a reset?" Reinhart said, when asked if Replanted's launch was the franchise resetting to its origins, after various spin-offs and sequels. "I think that's an interesting way to sort of frame the question. What I would say is that I think it's more of a reacknowledgement of what our roots are, and what sort of games we should be thinking about and what we should be making."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Has the brand ever gone away? No," Reinhart continued. "A reset, to me, almost implies 'well, it's been dead on the vine,' and we're, like, trying to bring it back or something like that. I don't think it's there. I do think that it's an opportunity for us to reestablish that this is a brand that people love, that there are still a lot of Neighborville stories that we can and should tell, and that we have to author that, to some extent, with our fan base in mind, and that we have to be able to acknowledge what we've done there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, PopCap has arrived on its decision to relaunch the original Plants vs Zombies after seeing the reaction to its more recent games in the series. 2013's smartphone-only Plants vs Zombies 2 was popular and long-lasting, though included touchscreen power-ups and microtransactions that grated with some players. More recent years have seen the franchise's console focus transform into a 3D shooter, via the Garden Warfare spin-off franchise — though for now, 2019 entry Battle for Neighborville appears to be the last. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even PopCap itself, previously a prolific creator of bizarre but compulsive game ideas (Feeding Frenzy! Zuma! Bookworm!) has consolidated its focus in recent years. Bejeweled Stars will be a decade old next year, while Peggle 2 is 12 years old already, with no sign of a third entry on the horizon. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-gameplaynight-1753890173477.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say that the passion of the community is an important thing that has to be galvanized and recognized," Reinhart said, discussing why PopCap has gone back to PvZ's roots now. "So much of what inspires our design decisions is, how we make sure that we are keeping something that is familiar, that doesn't entirely break the compact we have made with the player base, but that we can also then begin to iterate and move it forward as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game has given us an opportunity to go and dive in and try to figure out exactly what it is that people love about PvZ," Neri added. "And there's a lot of learning that we've done about the zaniness of the IP and how it appeals to people in that way, and that helps guide us and help us be true to what the the expectation is."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This desire to keep within fan expectations helped informed PopCap's choice of new modes for Replanted, Neri continued, as while the developer had plenty of ideas and could have gone in "all different directions," Replanted's team instead aimed for what they thought fans would actually want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're very thoughtful about how much innovation we bring into it," Reinhart agreed, "and not just trying to alienate the core overall experience for players... As we look to the future, we're looking at the brand more holistically and saying, what else is there? And what would it mean for us to reinvestigate some of that? There are no formal plans for right now, but it's something we are spending a lot of time looking at. But for this year, for the current stanza of where PopCap is, it is back at tower defense, and we're excited about that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've done a ton of exploration around what people loved about all the different versions of PvZ and trying to bring it back into this version," Neri added. "As we go forward, I definitely hope that Replanted will be an anchor for for us, that people can look to and understand — because the original PvZ still lives in people's hearts and minds."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-levelselect-1753890173478.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what of the future? Does a return to the more grounded original Plants vs Zombies in Replanted offer a clue as to where the franchise could go next? Or could it spark the re-release of other PopCap classics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've absolutely been having conversations about — if this is fruitful, if this meets the fans expectations... is this a template?" Reinhart said. "I think there's a lot of enthusiasm about that. Now, whether or not there are actually plans ongoing yet, we can't say that, but I would say we're very interested to see how this goes and what it would maybe mean for other properties to sort of maybe follow a similar route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PvZ is incredibly enduring," Reinhart concluded, "and being able to bring that to a new audience, to reawaken people's nostalgia and their feelings about it as well, especially in a time where I think the world could use a little bit of joy and wackiness, it just feels like the right time for that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The game will launch for all platforms on December 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> will let players create a customizable character for the first time, and set off on a "journey of restoration" after your home town of Wishvale is burned to the ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Footage shown in today's debut trailer features the series' usual HD-2D visual style, with turn-based battles and the ability to rebuild Wishvale by placing and designing homes and other buildings. A press release for the game promises over 30 recruitable party members, and a return of the series' Break &amp; Boost battle system.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the idea of an Octopath Traveler prequel sounds familiar, that's because this game incorporates story elements from Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a free-to-play spin-off for smartphones, released back in 2020 within Japan, and more widely in 2022. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a blog post, Square Enix said that while Octopath Traveler 0 was "inspired by story elements and gameplay ideas from that game", it was also designed from the ground-up as a "full-fledged console and PC RPG" with additional narrative content, fresh character backstories, full voice acting, and the aforementioned town-building feature. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The name Octopath Traveler 0 conveys the idea that you're undertaking a journey of your own making," producer Hirohito Suzuki said in a statement. "Whether you've played the first game in the series, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, or even neither, we’ve packed this game with original experiences that can be enjoyed by anyone! I look forward to players experiencing this new story for themselves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix's first Octopath Traveler originally launched for Nintendo Switch back in 2018, before eventually launching on other platforms in subsequent years. Octopath Traveler 2, meanwhile, arrived in 2023. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's presentation also saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-is-square-enixs-latest-new-action-rpg-coming-to-switch-2">Square Enix announce a second HD-2D title, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, which looks to  be a brand new action RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything else announced, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

No matter which one you buy, though, all have the same expected estimated release date of February 2026.</p><div catalogid="d6c6ae7e-891a-43aa-a5c8-76fb10d87c7f" id="226178"><div id="226178" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Original Soundtrack - Vinyl)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, the<a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXogd?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> IGN Store</u></a> (which is owned by our Parent Company IGN Entertainment), was selling the exclusive black and gold galaxy effect variants of both the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP85NZ?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>6LP Vinyl</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL87Wm?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>2LP Viny</u>l</a> for $155/£143 and $47/£44 respectively, before selling out of stock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the IGN store still has the standard black versions of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgE5P?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>6LP Vinyl for $145/£134</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/985mqq?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>2LP for $42/£39</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDrkJ?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Laced Records</u></a>, who specialises in physical music media, are taking preorders for the standard black vinyls too, both the <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/clair-obscur/products/clair-obscur-expedition-33-deluxe-x6lp-boxset" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>6LP set for $145/£115</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAWyp?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Double Vinyl for $42/£36</u></a>.

"In my films, I’m always trying to maximize the immersion, put the audience into the main character’s shoes. Hideo is the master of this and he does it on a whole other level. What he’s cooking up here is completely immersive, utterly terrifying, and I am absolutely honored to be collaborating with the GOAT. Let’s go.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima didn't share the extent of Peele's involvement in OD. However, he did tease more impressive names that haven't been revealed yet:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can say right now, is it’s not just Jordan. I have other creative partners with me on board on this project.
