            <p>Swen Vinke, the CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Divinity developer Larain, has responded to the intense backlash the studio has received since its use of generative AI was confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated"> the Larian CEO stated the studio is using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>, with Vinke saying "everyone at the company is more or less OK" with the way the technology is being implemented. He added the studio's upcoming and newly-announced release Divinity won't contain anything which has been AI-generated.</p>
<p>Soon after Vinke's statements went live, however, he was met with backlash from fans <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">as well as former Larian developers</a>, which prompted the studio head to respond with his <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833"> own post</a>, stating: "Holy fuck guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI."  </p>

<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 head added Larian has "a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more", with the artwork they create being original and something Vinke is "very proud" of.</p>
<p>Continuing further, Vinke said he was "asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI" during the interview with Bloomberg. "I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn't say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists".</p><p>Vinke stated the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", in the same way it uses the likes of Google and art books. "At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art," he said. "There is no comparison."</p>
<p>Larian hires its team of creatives for "their talent", Vinke closed, and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests". He again reiterated the team can still "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier".</p>

<p>In a further statement shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">IGN</a>, Vinke again clarified that Larian is not looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI. It will also not be releasing a game which includes content made by the technology.</p>
<p>You can read Vinke's statement in full below:</p>
<p>"We've been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p>
<p>"Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p>
<p>"Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</p>
<p>"Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual's workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p>
<p>"We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.</p>
<p>"We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p>
<p>"While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse."</p>

<p>While <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/braak.bsky.social/post/3ma53v5blo222">many remain unconvinced of Vincke's response</a>, others have pointed out Larian is far from the only beloved studio to admit to using AI. The "Expedition 33 team freely admitted using AI and just won the most awards ever in The Game Awards history," <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/2001061930547503396">Washington Post reporter Gene Park noted on social media</a>.</p><p>AI, of course, remains a key area of discussion across the industry, and reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines. Earlier this month, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games">Bethesda's Todd Howard shared his own thoughts on the use of AI in video games</a>, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>As for Larian, it is working on Divinity, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announced at The Game Awards with a rather gruesome and unsettling trailer</a>. Vinke has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">since said Larian's upcoming game is the studio "unleashed"</a>, while confirming it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>

		<p>Peak has been updated to version 1.50a in what will be the final content update of 2025 for the co-op climbing game. This update makes things feel festive and wintry with the airport getting Christmas decorations and some of the biomes getting a layering of snow, except Caldera as its too hot for snow to settle there. In addition, Aggro Crab and Landfall have stated that going forward updates will fewer, though more content is planned for 2026.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/nacon-rig-r5-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/</link>
            <guid>1385632</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In recent years, the most reliable headset brand, at least for my ears, has been Nacon RIG. For years, their industrial looks have been married to high-quality gaming audio, and that’s seen them remain a firm favourite in our home. So, it’s with some surprise that the latest RIG headset, the R5 Pro HS doesn’t actually look like any of the headsets that have come before it. This much more restrained and customisable design still hosts RIG’s excellent audio, though, making this a late peripheral highlight in 2025.</p>
<p>The R5 Pro HS is a 3.5mm wired headset, meaning that it’s compatible with anything hosting a headphone socket, including PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s often nice to have the simplicity of a wired headset; you never have to remember to charge it, or place it on a dock, it’s just ready to go.</p>



<p>That simplicity extends to the R5’s controls, with an inline volume control sitting midway down the cable, itself boasting a slide control that clicks into place at full volume. It was always easy to find the control when I needed it, and I appreciated the fact that it was right there, whether hitting louder sections in a game, or needing to turn things down to hear somebody talking to me.</p>
<p>The microphone is similarly straightforward, with a flip-to-mute action that stops its output when pointing straight up. The boom arm is made of flexible metal with a rubberised coating, giving it a decent degree of movement and optimisation that sees it stay exactly where you put it. The mic itself boasts a 50 Hz–15 kHz frequency range, and it proved perfect for game chat and the odd Zoom call, though I do think I’d look for a dedicated mic if I was streaming and talking to an audience.</p>

<p>While there’s elements of the older RIG headset design language if you look really closely – you can see it in the squared-off bottoms of each earcup – Nacon have clearly decided to move towards a more modern and understated overall look. That means that the R5 Pro HS have lost some of the character of those older headsets, but you could actually wear these outside of your home without drawing any side eye. It’s clean, confident, and I like the shift in design as we head into 2026.</p>

<p>The R5’s little party trick is that it has customisable magnetic plates on the outside of each earcup, letting you add a touch of your own personality to them. It’s a decent enough idea, and one we’ve seen before with headsets like the Turtle Beach Elite Pro 2, but there, the support for different plates dried up pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Nacon don’t want that to happen. Instead, even before their own options are available, they’ve released the STL files, letting those with access to 3D printing get started making their own plates straight away. This means that players will be able to create their own, completely unique plates, and I can see it being a popular headset, simply for this level of customisation. Out of the box, you’re getting two PlayStation-branded covers, but if you want to remove them, the R5 Spear Pro not only gets even lighter and easier on your ears, it gives it a real retro vibe that I definitely enjoyed.</p>
<p>Comfort isn’t an issue, with or without the plates, and the magnetic ear cushions – which you’ll also be able to buy alternate versions of – are thick, soft and plush. I was able to wear the R5 Spear Pro for days on end, helped by the ample padding on the headband, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable, easy-to-live-with headset.</p>

<p>In terms of audio, the R5 Pro HS’s 40mm graphene drivers do a fantastic job of delivering all of your gaming needs directly into your ears, in suitably detailed form. I’ve been playing a ton of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>, and it was the ideal game to test them out with. The soundtrack, composed by Blood Cultures, had plenty of menacing thump, though the bass was never overwhelming. The R5 Pro HS are more bass-heavy than the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/turtle-beach-atlas-200-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Atlas 200</a>, meaning that action games and bass-heavy music tracks have some serious weight.</p>
<p>If you’re so inclined, the R5 Pro HS are a decent option for listening to music as well. Besides mainlining the Skate Story Vol. 1 album, I’m still stuck on President’s King of Terror EP, and the aggressive guitars and electronic tones sounded great, with some decent spacing in the soundstage. They might edge towards the mid-range a bit more than some other headsets out there, but away from music, it means that dialogue and speech rings through that step clearer than elsewhere, and the wider soundstage means that you feel truly enveloped by the game worlds you’re exploring.</p>

<p>With an RRP of £69.90, the key competitor to the R5 Spear Pro this holiday season is the Turtle Beach Atlas 200, and it’s a tough battle as they’re both excellent wired headsets. The build quality of the R5 is definitely stronger, has better audio, and I much prefer the design, but the Atlas 200 probably just edges it in terms of comfort, thanks to its lighter weight. If you’re looking for customisation though, the R5 is the clear winner.</p>

			<p>Yesterday's Bloomberg report about the new Divinity game <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first made headlines for the confirmation of the combat system (turn-based)</a> and the ambition to deliver a bigger, better game than even the award-winning Baldur's Gate 3 in less time. Then, following the backlash against Larian's usage of AI for development assistance, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to issue a clarifying statement</a>.</p>



<p>The studio's founder, owner, and game director also participated in several other interviews just before (or after) The Game Awards 2025 event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's official announcement</a> there, though. In the article <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-you-like-baldurs-gate-3-this-is-gonna-be-great-larian-boss-swen-vincke-reveals-what-to-expect-from-divinity-in-first-interview-since-the-game-awards-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by IGN</a>, Vincke admitted that one of the changes (albeit one that requires a lot of work) compared to previous Divinity titles will be the greatly enhanced worldbuilding.</p>



<p><em>We learned the value of having a solid universe behind you, for sure. One of the first things we started doing was saying, 'Okay, we're gonna put a lot of effort into making this universe feel tidy.' That's also why we are just calling it Divinity, right? There's never been a game that's just Divinity first, because there were all kinds of versions with different names. So this is actually going to be Divinity, which is going to have a proper universe backing it. We're building everything as you would expect, with lots of surprises, so that we can build on top of it. We learned that from BG, because we spent a lot of time delving through all kinds of DnD books, so that's probably one of the biggest takeaways from that development process.</em></p>



<p>[...] <em>We really wanted to tidy up because the first Divinity games were made with little thought for universe-building, and it's only in Original Sin 2 that we started thinking more about it – but even then, not really 100% to what we did with Baldur's Gate 3. So now we're really thinking about it, and so that's a lot of work to make sure we get it right. Because it's the little things, right? I mean, what do people do when they go out to eat? What do they do when they go to sleep? What all of that has to be called out.</em></p>



<p>When I first <span>spoke with my colleague Francesco De Meo about what I'd like to see in the new game after the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/" target="_blank">trademark leak</a>, I immediately told him&nbsp;</span>that Larian would have to significantly step up its game in that specific area. While the setting of Rivellon does have potential, its current incarnation cannot be compared to established fantasy worlds like The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, or Dragon Age, let alone Baldur's Gate 3's Forgotten Realms, which is by far the most popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting and definitely aided BG3's enormous success.</p>



<p>It simply needs a lot more depth, texture, and lore to measure up to such intricately detailed settings. To that end, beyond just fleshing out the world a lot more in preparation for the upcoming game, Larian would do well to look into transmedia opportunities. Divinity: Original Sin got an official board game, but what the setting could really use is a few novels to make fans more attached to specific characters, events, and factions. An animated series could help, too, although that'd be a lot more expensive. As far as in-game features go, it would be nice to have a Codex-like feature that allows players to reference universe-specific terms, events, and people.</p>



<p>Overall, I am pleased that Larian correctly identified the importance of having a strong setting to build their next game upon. Based on what Vincke said, they're trying to finish Divinity quicker than Baldur's Gate 3's six-year timeframe, although that will be a tricky proposition given the size and quality ambition. Still, we'll continue to report on any major development updates. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Terminator Survivors hasn’t had the best journey into the market. In the closing days of 2025, Nacon Studio Milan has emerged on social media to share a major development update about the upcoming open-world survival game set in the iconic sci-fi universe. The game’s creative director addressed fans directly in what amounts to an open letter, but it’s <strong>not </strong>good news.</p>



<p>Marco Ponte, the leader of the game’s creative angle, thanked fans for their patience and reaffirmed the studio’s commitment to delivering an honest representation of the Terminator universe, but things are not looking encouraging.</p>



<h2 id="h-terminator-survivors-delayed-with-no-new-date-in-sight">Terminator Survivors Delayed With No New Date in Sight</h2>



<p>According to Ponte, the team at Nacon Studio Milan has made ‘significant progress’ this year across multiple areas. He referenced world design, combat systems, and narrative depth as key. The goal remains clear: to envelop players in a bleak, post-apocalyptic environment where Skynet’s machines dominate humanity.</p>



<p>Players are set to step into the role of survivors rising from the rubble, fighting Skynet’s earlier prototypes, and helping to spark the resistance we all know too well from the movie franchise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some of the changes Ponte references might come as a shock to those awaiting delivery of Terminator Survivors.</p>



<p>The game will now be a single-player title, with Nacon Studio Milan having stripped multiplayer mechanics clean from the title.</p>



<p>It was said that this was the result of extensive testing and discussion with fans, and the developers concluded that focusing on a single-player experience would better capture the uncompromising vision of the Terminator world. While this decision might come as a disappointment to some, Ponte suggests it’s how they can ‘deliver the most authentic gameplay possible.’</p>



<p>Additionally, the studio has decided <strong>against </strong>an early-access release, and instead, Terminator Survivors will launch as a complete, polished (hopefully) product.</p>



<p>The bad news is that the game’s release has been delayed indefinitely, and there’s no indication whatsoever of when it might surface.</p>



<p>Nacon Studio Milan has promised to arrange closed playtests under NDA as the launch window hopefully draws closer. In the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Steam</a>, Ponte invited fans to sign up to contribute to the effort.</p>

<p>Multiple revived and enhanced titles are on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nitrome, the talented British indie developer currently crafting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> for the Switch 2, has this week announced a new series.</p>
<p>Nitrome Classics revives a range of titles from <a href="https://www.nitrome.com/">Nitrome's past</a> and is "lovingly" porting them to the Nintendo Switch and other platforms with various enhancements and updates. More platform releases could also "potentially" follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All of the games are not just meticulously restored but improved with higher frame rates, full screen aspect ratios and with higher quality music. Many of the games will be packaged as mini collections within a franchise and include additional content not found in the original release."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game in this series is <strong>Twin Shot Deluxe</strong> (a title which began life on web browsers), and it will be released in "early" 2026. <strong>Silly Sausage</strong> and <strong>Skywire</strong> will follow this game. Here are the details about the first title on the way (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618520/Twin_Shot_Deluxe/">via Steam</a>), and you can check out a trailer of this new Classics series above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Angel Cats are back and better than ever before in this complete remaster.</p>
<p><em>Twin Shot Deluxe</em> is an arcade platform shooter where players defend their homeland from invaders using bows and arrows. Take aim at over 200 brand new levels set across four worlds, each with unique challenges, bosses and enemies. Play solo or team up with friends in local cooperative play (one-to-four players) or play competitively to see who will be crowned champion.</p>
<p>A brand new Atlantis theme to explore, defeat additional bosses, unlock fancy headwear with special powers for extended replay, and much more… relive your childhood and take to the skies!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can also expect new bosses, cheats as well as a graphical overhaul – including a frame rate and resolution update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We could not leave the game lagging in the past at 20 frames per second, it has now been upgraded to an angelic 60 frames per second, and now with a modern 16:9 ratio—that’s 78 percent more <em>Twin Shot</em>. We even have a brand new intro animatic and ending illustrations remastered to pixel art perfection."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from the upcoming Switch 2 release Mouse Work, which utilises Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Nitrome is the same team that has previously worked on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bomb_chicken">Bomb Chicken</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dota-2-largo-introduced-valve/</link>
            <guid>1385602</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait is over—Valve has finally released Dota 2 patch 7.40, ending one of the longest gaps between updates in the game’s history. Alongside sweeping balance changes and hero reworks, Valve has added new items and even a new hero – <strong>Largo</strong>. This larger-than-life character is a whimsical frog bard (really), and he joins the game as the 127th hero to date.</p>



<p>His melee support build enables allies and disrupts enemies quite nicely, by all accounts.</p>







<h2 id="h-largo-enters-dota-2-in-patch-7-40">Largo Enters Dota 2 in Patch 7.40</h2>



<p>Largo’s kit is interesting and, as you could probably imagine, themed entirely around his existence as a <strong>frog</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Catchy Lick</strong>: A tongue pull that dispels and damages, granting Largo regeneration when cleansing effects</li>



<li><strong>Frogstomp</strong>: Summoned froglings stomp the ground, dealing damage, mini‑stunning, and slowing foes.</li>



<li><strong>Croak of Genius</strong>: Cast on allies to reduce mana costs and echo their damage over time.</li>



<li><strong>Amphibian Rhapsody</strong>: A musical ultimate where Largo strums songs—<strong>Bullbelly Blitz</strong> for spell amplification, <strong>Hotfeet Hustle</strong> for speed and resistance, and <strong>Island Elixir</strong> for healing. Successful strums build “Groovin’” stacks, boosting armor and reducing mana costs.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s an interesting lineup.</p>



<p>Largo uses Aghanim’s upgrades to expand his toolkit. For instance, the <strong>Shard </strong>mirrors buffs onto Largo himself, while the Scepter lets him play two songs per beat and deal bonus magic damage.</p>



<p>Here’s a bit of background on Largo:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Originating from the Murkroot Forest, Largo’s people fled after the Talga‑Ruun’s invasion. His sacred music revived the dying island of Valu’Mar, cementing him as a bard of salvation. Now he travels beyond his homeland, spreading inspiration with his frogling companions and enchanted lute.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo?fbclid=IwY2xjawOthfNleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFUSlFOcDcyRThZSWdwakFjc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHoCLalh9HGaR_y7XF4IsSNc6tm84oG3CF22la_kgxeHiSoK4AEKEMdFq6-AY_aem_Fcmjvq55wNLcmyBOQ-QsSQ&amp;brid=cC-n1vNdLPqRrTJeMQ7_dw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dota 2’s Patch 7.40</a> also reworks existing heroes like Lone Druid, Slark, and Treant Protector. It refreshes the neutral item pool and introduces terrain adjustments that will have an impact on the competitive landscape.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to scoop rewards, you can also lean on Patch 7.40 to secure riches in the Winter Treasure 2025 LTE. There are sixteen new sets across the hero lineup to secure.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be using Largo in Dota 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Mobile Releasing Worldwide on February 23, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-mobile-releasing-february/</link>
            <guid>1385593</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The mobile esports world is about to get a considerable amount more impressive, as Ubisoft has just announced the impending release date for Rainbow Six Mobile. The long-awaited launch of the game comes more than three years after it was revealed, and it’s set to arrive on February 23, 2026.</p>



<p>It won’t be a staggered deployment, either. The game will be released globally on that day. Reportedly, the delay in producing this game comes from years of testing and preparation, so that Ubisoft can launch a game that’s as stable and ‘esports-ready’ as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-mobile-coming-soon">Rainbow Six Mobile Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a short trailer uploaded hours ago, Ubisoft unveiled the release date for Rainbow Six Mobile, the eagerly anticipated handheld version of the company’s flagship first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has dominated the market for a decade, standing firm as one of the top esports games around. It’ll now expand on that notion with a handheld version.</p>



<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft held a soft launch for Rainbow Six Mobile, kick-starting a series of technical tests in specific territories to start bedding in the game. Now that the game is fleshed out with new operators and some fresh content, they’ve decided to blast off with a global launch next February.</p>



<p>If you live in Canada, France, Poland, and the LATAM regions, you can download and play Rainbow Six Mobile now, but it’ll be a bit of a test product. It has proven to be a hit in those territories, so it’s only fair that Ubisoft now pushes the game out to a much wider audience.</p>



<p>This free-to-play mobile game has been turning heads in those regions, and now it’s time to go global. Will you be playing? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Season 2 Rotten Tomatoes Score Higher Than Season 1]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/</link>
            <guid>1385542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The second season of Prime Video’s Fallout got its reviews today, and they are quite favorable. Even more so, the Bethesda series’ sophomore season has beaten the first season’s Rotten Tomatoes score by a good bit.</p>



<p>Despite the ‘video game adaptation curse’, Prime Video’s Fallout beat the odds seemingly out of nowhere. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the show captured what made the games special with a delightful mix of comedy and action. Released in 2024, it became a smash hit, even earning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-won-emmy-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Primetime Emmy nominations</a> like Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. It was clear a new season was in order, and, as of writing, the first episode is available to watch. Critics have already seen most of what the show has to offer and, if what Rotten Tomatoes rates is true, it outdoes the first season in a big way. </p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-certified-fresh-at-97-on-rotten-tomatoes-4-higher-than-first">Fallout Season 2 Certified Fresh at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, 4% Higher than First</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout Season Two Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECI3eCAxRGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which collects all available reviews for media, Fallout Season 2 received a 97% rating. With 39 reviews, it is now Certified Fresh. While the score can change as more reviews come in, the second season outperformed the first by 4%. Fallout Season 1 scored an impressive 93% with over 133 reviews. </p>



<p>The better score does bode well for the series’ second outing. Fallout Season 2 continues the story of Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus as the world expands to New Vegas. Its impressive accolades and numbers for Prime Video have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-possibly-filming-summer-2026-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greenlit it for a third season</a>, which aims to film in Summer 2026. It is quite rare for a game adaptation to get another shot, much less be better than the first. Fortunately, Prime Video’s Fallout has done just that, ensuring fans will have some treats in store for the series.</p>

Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.</p><p>To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.</p><p>Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.</p><p>Additionally, a handful of free holiday items will appear at the in-game store on specific dates:</p><ul><li><strong>December 18</strong>: Tackle of the First Snows (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 19</strong>: Fallow-ward (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 20</strong>: Crook of First Snow (Mount Armor)</li></ul><p>As with the rest of treasures, those items will disappear after January 6.</p><p>Outside of the game, the prequel to next year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred expansion</a>, Diablo 4: The Lost Horadrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-prequel-novel-preorder-guide/1100-6536997/" data-ref-id="1100-6536997">is available for preorder now</a>.

<h3>Pikmin 4 - Version 1.1.1 (16th December 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>Fix Related to Giving Oatchi Commands</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now give the “Go to Work” command to Oatchi in your squad right away when you keep pressing the A Button after throwing all of the Pikmin in your squad.
<ul>
<li>For tasks where there aren’t enough Pikmin, or things Oatchi is unable to do, the command will still be stopped temporarily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Roll Overs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you start a new game with Roll Over, you can now carry over all of Oatchi’s previously learned skills.
<ul>
<li>Speak to the captain and go into the training screen after Oatchi grows and you are able to do training.</li>
<li>Note: You cannot perform Roll Over starts in the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some treasures are not reflected in the completion of the Treasure Catalog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Creature Activity Levels</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the activity level is set to “Relaxed,” the following creatures will no longer attack unless you attack them first.
<ul>
<li>Moss</li>
<li>Waterwraith</li>
<li>Dweevils Carrying Bomb Rocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While the activity level is set to “Relaxed,” creatures are less likely to inhale Pikmin or catch them with their tongues.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Grubchucker is unable to prey on Pikmin while the activity level is set to “Fierce.”</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some creatures would freeze in place when fed multiple Bomb Rocks while the activity level is set to “Fierce.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Decor Pikmin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made it easier to “Say Cheese” when taking pictures of some Decor Pikmin.</li>
<li>Decor Pikmin are now unaffected when a creature performs an attack where they suck in Pikmin.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where there was sometimes a delay in reflecting what Decor Pikmin you have found when sending that data to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.
<ul>
<li>Note: Decor Pikmin data cannot be sent to Pikmin Bloom from the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Auto Target Lock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a setting that makes it so the cursor is not locked in place from repeatedly pressing the A Button while Auto Target Lock is set to “Off.”
<ul>
<li>Note: You can switch between “On” and “Off” by opening the Pause menu (- Button), selecting “Settings,” and going to “Tap A Repeatedly to Lock.” (This is set to “Off” by default.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Button Guide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation will now appear in screen while in “Photo Mode” when using the Field Camera indicating that you can move the camera up or down using the up and down direction buttons on the Joy-Con (L) (or the up and down buttons on the +Control Pad of the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed other issues to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A patch with the same changes has also been distributed for the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo. The demo version cannot send Decor Pikmin information to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.</p>
<hr>
<p>This follows recent calls from fans for a Switch 2 upgrade for Pikmin 4, after an odd listing was spotted on the eShop earlier this month.</p>
<p>In some other update news, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_tennis_aces">Mario Tennis Aces</a> on the Switch has been <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29137">updated to Version 3.1.1</a> today.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-old-soundbar-for-good-sonos-beam-hits-record-low-one-week-before-christmas-on-amazon-2000653981</link>
            <guid>1385506</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>TV audio quality has improved dramatically over the years, but slim modern displays sacrifice speaker quality for sleek designs and leave you with tinny sound that undermines your viewing experience. Finding space for full surround sound systems proves challenging in apartments or smaller living rooms where bulky speakers and subwoofers simply don’t fit the layout.</p>
<p>Sonos has built its reputation on delivering premium audio in compact formats and the Beam (Gen 2) addresses the soundbar needs of space-conscious homes without compromising performance: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">Dolby Atmos soundbar currently sells for $369 on Amazon, down from its regular $499 price</a>, and marks an all-time low for one of the most respected names in home audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A small package with immersive audio</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dolby Atmos support makes soundscapes that are three-dimensional</strong> and puts sounds above, around, and next to you instead of just in front of you. This adds depth that regular stereo soundbars can’t match. Height channels bounce sound off your ceiling to make it sound like helicopters are flying by or rain is falling from above. This makes the scenes feel more real. The effect works best in rooms with flat ceilings that are less than 10 feet high. It can’t match dedicated ceiling speakers, but the virtual height makes the soundstage seem very big.</p>
<p>One of the most common complaints about TV audio is that voices get lost in music and sound effects and the <strong>crystal clear dialogue reproduction</strong> fixes this. Sonos designed a separate center channel processing system that focuses on vocal frequencies, so you can hear every word without having to change the volume all the time. Speech Enhancement mode makes speech even clearer when needed. This is helpful during shows with strong accents or lines that are hard to understand that would otherwise need subtitles.</p>



<p>The <strong>200-watt maximum output</strong> gives you enough volume to fill medium to large rooms without distortion. It also pushes clean sound even when the volume is high, when cheaper soundbars start to crackle. The frequency response goes down to 50.4Hz, which gives explosions and music a nice bass presence without needing a subwoofer. You’ll feel the low-end impact during action scenes and bass-heavy songs, but bass lovers might want to get Sonos’ dedicated Sub for really low frequencies that shake the room. The<strong> small size of 25.6 inches wide</strong> makes it easy to fit under most TVs without blocking screens or making entertainment centers too big.</p>
<p>The <strong>Trueplay tuning technology uses the microphone on your iPhone or iPad to figure out how sound travels in your room</strong> and then automatically changes the soundbar’s output for the best sound. The app plays test tones while you walk around the room. It measures how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and ceilings to make a custom EQ profile. This calibration makes up for acoustic problems like putting speakers in corners or on bare walls, which would otherwise change the sound. This makes sure that the sound is always the same, no matter how the room is set up.</p>



<p>You only need two cables to set it up: The HDMI eARC cable connects to your TV for sound, and the power cable plugs into an outlet. With an HDMI connection, all of your TV’s audio sources can be sent through a single cable which means you don’t have to connect each device directly to the soundbar. The Beam knows when you turn on your TV and turns on automatically. You can also use your current TV remote to change the volume without having to program anything else.</p>
<p>Getting the Sonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 is a great deal because it’s the lowest price this model has ever been at and you’re getting high-quality audio engineering from a top company. The lowest price ever makes Sonos quality affordable for people who thought it was too expensive before, and the timing right before the holiday season makes it the perfect time to upgrade.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-offloads-dualsense-edge-at-record-low-pro-gamers-get-elite-controller-at-casual-gamer-price-2000653974</link>
            <guid>1385485</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Professional gaming demands precision and customization that standard controllers simply cannot provide, and <strong>the DualSense Edge addresses these needs with hardware-level adjustments</strong> that competitive players have requested for years. This premium controller takes everything great about the standard DualSense and adds swappable components, remappable buttons, and adjustable sensitivity curves that let you fine-tune performance for specific games or playstyles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">Midnight Black edition currently sells for $169 on Amazon, down from its regular $199 price</a>, and <strong>marks an all-time low for Sony’s pro-level controlle</strong>r just before Christmas with <strong>guaranteed holiday delivery</strong>. That 15% discount makes advanced gaming hardware more accessible to serious players who want every possible advantage without spending Xbox Elite controller money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Personalization That Fits Your Style of Play</h2>
<p>You <strong>can now map back buttons to the bottom of the controller</strong> which changes the way you play games. You can assign actions you use a lot to these buttons. You can assign any face button action, like jump, crouch, or reload, to these back paddles. This way, you can keep your thumbs on the analog sticks when you need to press face buttons. This constant contact with the stick makes it easier to aim in shooters and keeps control of the camera in action games where split-second reactions can change the outcome.</p>
<p>The<strong> replaceable stick modules fix the problem of analog stick drift</strong> that happens to controllers after a lot of use. When the old ones wear out, you can just put in new ones. When sticks start to drift, you have to buy a whole new controller with traditional controllers. With the Edge, you can just replace the worn parts for a lot less money. You can easily switch out the modules without any tools, and Sony sells replacement modules separately so you can keep using them.</p>



<p>You can change how much stick movement counts as input by changing the stick sensitivity and dead zones. This lets you change the response curves to fit your needs and preferences in the game. High sensitivity settings are good for fast-paced shooters where quick camera movements are important. Lower sensitivity settings are better for long-range shooting where accuracy is important. Dead zone adjustments get rid of the unwanted movement that can happen with looser sticks, making it easier to control in competitive play.</p>
<p>The <strong>stick caps that come with it come in three heights and two shapes</strong> so you can pick the ones that fit your hand size and grip style. Taller sticks give you better control because they make your thumb move a longer distance for the same input. This is helpful for precise aiming in tactical shooters. Shorter sticks let you move faster with less thumb travel, which is better for aggressive playstyles in games that need quick changes of direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>trigger stops shorten the distance that L2 and R2 can travel</strong> which lets you fully press the trigger faster for quick firing in shooters. The adjustable stops click into place at different points, and you can change each trigger to fit the needs of the game. Full trigger travel is better for racing games that use analog throttle control, while minimal travel is better for shooters who want to shoot faster.</p>
<p>The Midnight Black colorway gives the Edge a stealthy look that sets it apart from regular controllers while still keeping PlayStation’s clean design style. The matte finish doesn’t show fingerprints as much as glossy plastics, and the high-quality materials feel solid in your hand. Because of the extra electronics, the battery life is shorter than that of standard DualSense controllers. It <strong>usually lasts 5 to 7 hours, depending on how many features you use</strong> which means that you’ll need to keep the charging cable close by during long gaming sessions.</p>
<p>Getting the DualSense Edge for $169 is a great deal because it’s the lowest price this controller has ever been on Amazon and it lets you customize it like a pro. The lowest prices ever make it easier for serious gamers to get pro-level features that they couldn’t afford before.</p>

This deal offers a selection of various acclaimed PC games featured in the various Platinum Collection bundles throughout 2025, giving you a chance to pick up some excellent games for cheap. Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment.</p><p>One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.

The list of possible games also includes the strategy game SteamWorld Build as another pick, in case you want to load up on even more of the series.</p><p>With season 2 of the Fallout TV show looming, now's the perfect time to explore the open-world RPGs that inspired the show with Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition. Both are available as part of the Best of Platinum Collection. These versions include the full base games plus every update, add-on, and DLC expansion. You can round out the selection with Fallout 76, which is an online multiplayer take on the series--though it still offers the same open-ended, first-person exploration and RPG gameplay as the other games. It also recently received a new Burning Springs DLC update that ties into the Amazon Prime Video streaming series.</p><p>For you horror fans, one of the biggest highlights of the Platinum Collection is the inclusion of Amnesia: The Bunker. The Amnesia games are some of the most tense, atmospheric, and terrifying survival horror games to be found in the genre, and getting it at this price is a steal.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Platinum Collection, including the narrative-driven RPG Disco Elysium: The Final Cut, the hidden FPS gem RoboCop: Rogue City, the Lego-themed puzzle game Lego Bricktales, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’ve not come across it yet, Songs of Silence is one of the most beautiful fantasy tactics games you’ll ever see. Originally released in 2024, this hybrid RTS/autobattler – with a smidgen of deckbuilding – boasts some truly incredible art nouveau visual design. Characters, artwork, and the different unit classes, sing out from the screen, blessing you with their stunning, evocative looks. Luckily for us, the beautiful action doesn’t have to finish quite yet, with the huge Celestial Church DLC arriving today, bringing with it a host of much-requested features. </p>
<p><iframe title="Songs of Silence: Celestial Church - Official DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mT-oJ5C8-a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The and biggest and brightest inclusion is six all-new singleplayer campaign chapters, the six-hour-long additions furthering the story and deepening Songs of Silence’s lore, bringing all that incredible artwork to life in a more meaningful way than ever before. </p>
<p>There’s then the addition of a new faction, the titular Celestial Church, who in turn have brought a host of new units, abilities and cards to bear on the battlefield. I can’t wait to test them all out in the coming days.</p>
<p>The expansion was shaped by recurring community requests for additional story-focused experiences. Throughout its development, Songs of Silence has evolved hand-in-hand with player feedback gathered from open betas, surveys, and daily conversations between the team and the community. It’s not about to stop here either, with Chimera confirming that another expansion is planned for mid-2026, accompanied by numerous additional features that will arrive beforehand.</p>

<p>“Players asked for deeper narrative experiences, and the Celestial Church expansion is our answer to that call,” said Songs of Silence’s Executive Producer, Hendrik Lesser. “We’re excited to keep enriching the game and delivering meaningful content for years to come.”</p>
<p>I loved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/songs-of-silence-review/">Songs of Silence</a> at launch, and of course, I was utterly taken by the visuals, saying, “Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate is the most astonishing retro product I have ever reviewed. I was expecting it to be a straightforward, modern take on the all-time best-selling personal computer. I imagined it would be a newer version of the C64 Mini or C64 "Maxi," with a selection of games and software built in and accessible through a bespoke menu system. Seriously, I would have been totally fine with a modern C64 that hooks to modern 4K displays and televisions and let me experience the C64 ecosystem on the big screen. And it does that, extremely well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it also does so much more, more than I could have ever imagined it would. Better still, it does all those things amazingly well. From the spot-on design of the packaging down to the perfection of the keyboard in every way, the Commodore 64 Ultimate is the kind of modern take on retro hardware that all future endeavors in the space should aspire to. They won't. But they should.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What's In the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate packaging looks the part of its predecessor, although dimensionally they differ. The original C64 box is a little taller and a little less wide, but otherwise the modern take evokes the exact same feeling as the original right from the packaging. It's an excellent combination of both old and new, listing the modern capabilities of the device while using old-school images of people using the original on CRT displays. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Commodore 64 Ultimate is what all future retro endeavors in should aspire to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Right on the copy printed on the box, the Commodore 64 Ultimate positions itself as an antidote to the modern computing experience, which I'm completely into. As someone who's been using the Internet since before Netscape was even a thing, I often think back wistfully to how much simpler it was when a computer was a tool you used to create things, not a device that serves you ads. The tagline on the back says "Classic Form. Ultimate Function. Distraction Free." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you who weren’t born before 1980, the original Commodore 64 was not only the most successful 8-bit computer of the 1980s, it's the best-selling personal computer of all time. So many Gen-Xers grew up with a Commodore 64 as their first home computer, and if they didn't have one (like me), they knew someone who did. It debuted at $595 in 1982, but within a year, competition had cut the price in half. In the 1984 Sears Holiday Wishbook catalog it's listed at $229.99, while the Coleco Adam just a few pages later is $700. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7217-1765913719515.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The C64 was affordable, well supported, handled business and productivity applications while also having a huge library of games. You could load software from 5.25" floppies, cassette tapes, or cartridges. It was versatile, compact, extremely affordable and available everywhere. It also had a custom sound chip that let the C64 sing, literally, giving it a huge edge. The C64 produced an iconic sound modern chiptune artists like 8-bit Weapon still use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside the box is the Commodore 64 Ultimate itself, which is actually available in three different versions. There's the classic beige, a fully transparent and LED-lit model, and a special edition gold translucent version only available for those who backed the device early on. I'm going to get into the design later, but as soon as I opened the box I was struck by just how perfect this is in terms of replicating the look of the original.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7219-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also not one, but two, small, double-sided sheets of Commodore-branded vinyl stickers. The stickers are great. They're high-quality, not garbage paper ones like I would have expected, and it's just another delightful part of the experience. There are a few for the logo, one for the classic "READY" prompt, a tiny tape drive and floppy drive sticker, and more. It's great. I'm going to stick these things everywhere (except for the C64 Ultimate itself, of course).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a transparent plastic AC adapter with different interchangeable plug styles for your region, and a generous 2.5 meter HDMI cable in a Commodore branded bag. The cable itself is not branded, however, which is maybe the only thing I can point to with the C64 Ultimate and say "I wish this were different." The cable itself supports Ethernet over HDMI, for reasons I don't understand, as well as 4K resolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Underneath it all, nestled in a protective cocoon of bubble wrap, is probably my favorite addition to the C64 Ultimate box: an honest-to-goodness spiral-bound instruction manual just like the original. And it's an ACTUAL instruction manual, too. It's not just a 4-page quick start guide translated into 16 different languages to pad it out. This is an almost 250-page tome of goodness we just don't see anymore.  It's more than just a passing resemblance between the new and the old. Yes, there's a quick start guide, but beyond that, the manual teaches you how to use the Commodore 64 Ultimate in the same way the original manual taught you to use the C64. There's a section on BASIC, the computer programming language so many oldheads like me first learned, as well as Advanced BASIC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The C64 Ultimate comes with an honest-to-goodness spiral-bound instruction manual.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably my favorite thing about the C64 Ultimate: the fact it's a modern version of the old hardware on which I love writing BASIC programs. If you're not familiar with the language, its primary purpose was to make computer programming easier for beginners. In fact, the name BASIC is an acronym for "Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code." No one uses it anymore, not for anything serious. Ask anyone now and they'll tell you to start with Python.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7213-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Well I'm here to say those people are wrong, and BASIC is the perfect place to start. One of the greatest things about having a hardware-indentical version of the original Commodore 64 is all those old magazines and books with page upon page of BASIC code will still work exactly as they were intended. You've probably seen engagement-farming social media accounts talking about how "back in the day" people would copy programs from magazines, by hand, into their computers line by line. Can confirm, we really did. And with the C64 Ultimate we can use those same programs, or just copy and paste them and load them in via USB. I think that's cheating but I'm also not above it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven't delved deeply into the world of programming the C64 Ultimate, at least not yet, so I can't speak authoritatively on whether or not there's some string of code somewhere that won't work on the Ultimate. Knowing what little I know about FPGA, I don't think that will ever be a problem I'll come across. The beauty of FPGA versus software emulation is the hardware works exactly like the original. Sure, someone out there writing in assembly might find some peculiarity with the system that wasn't present in the original, but for me? Hell nah, let's get some BASIC code going baby!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Back in the day people would copy programs from magazines, by hand.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact you're taught BASIC in the manual, and then taught advanced BASIC, as well as sprite and sound manipulation, makes the manual even more of a valuable resource. This is exactly the kind of thing I love, and exactly the way computers used to be. You didn't just buy a computer to passively entertain yourself, you bought one to do rudimentary spreadsheets, play some games, and create your own experiences. I love it. The best thing about learning any computer language is the fundamentals are all pretty much the same. Once you understand if-then statements, or "for" loops in BASIC, you'll understand them in JavaScript, or C#, or pretty much any other language.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7215-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Peripherals, Modern and Classic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What was maybe the most surprising revelation to me about the Commodore 64 Ultimate was its support for the original Commodore peripherals. Things like the cassette deck and iconic 1501 floppy disc drive will work with the C64. I don't have the cassette deck, unfortunately, and while I have the floppy drive I don't actually have any floppies with which to test it. The big batch of floppies I picked up earlier this year were all unreadable, so sadly I can't speak to that, at least until I luck my way into another cache, one that hopefully works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I can say is the C64 Ultimate will work with a classic CRT monitor, and that just makes me all kinds of delighted. Is it more convenient to use it on a modern display? Yes, a thousand percent. Is it more fun? Not even close. Thankfully I have several CRT monitors compatible with the Commodore, including an original Commodore CM-141 monitor I drove two hours into the wilderness of Maine's coast to acquire. Weirdly, the default settings were in PAL and so I had to go in to change them, but once I did, I was absolutely delighted by the CRT-goodness. I don't have the correct cable to use the CM-141, but I do have one that let me hook it to an old Magnavox monitor that has a setting to output in a faux phosphor-green. Can't complain about that! </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7208-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I wish more retro-revival hardware had the option for analog video. I'm sure the people who want such a thing make up a very tiny percentage of the population, but for something as specialized as the Commodore 64 Ultimate, it is a perfect fit. The modern Commodore company sells the proper cables on its website, so I'm probably going to buy some just so I can plink away at my next BASIC program in front of the warm glow of a humming, 13" color CRT TV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another odd peripheral I have is a Commodore 1670 modem, though the Commodore 64 Ultimate lacks the User Port from the original where it hooks up. Instead, the Ultimate has modern connectivity like Wi-Fi and an Ethernet jack. It’s probably for the best anyway – I've messed around with slow, retro modems on old hardware before and it's fun, but 1200 baud makes even BBSes slow to use. And besides, if I do want that old-school experience, there's modem emulation built into the system anyway. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While having Wi-Fi rules, at first I couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work. I entered in my Wi-Fi password and waited for a while, tried it again, rebooted and tried one more time and it never showed the "Link Up" message on the Wi-Fi configuration page. It wasn't until after I hooked it to a wired connection that it decided to come to life, after which I was able to disconnect from the Ethernet cable and have it maintain its wireless connection. Not sure if that was just a coincidence or a weird bug, but it gave me a brief jolt of disappointment.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7216-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm also sadly lacking in C64 game cartridges, which is a bummer since the Commodore 64 Ultimate can play those, natively, through the expansion port in the back of the computer. But since it can run those carts, it can easily run ROM files, ones that you of course own legally or are provided from reputable, legal sources. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Spot-On Design</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate is indistinguishable from the original at first glance. Everything about it looks and feels exactly the same as the original. The beige case and brown keyboard is fantastically reproduced from the original, for better or for worse. It's not until you take a closer look do you start to notice the differences, with the modern ports, a transparent window on the side and a much smaller port for the AC adapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 logo badge on the top? Perfect. The red LED power light? Flawless. The keyboard? OK, like I said before, absolute perfection – for better or for worse. Let me explain myself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7207-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Typing on the Commodore 64 Ultimate gives you the exact same tactile feel of the original. The key travel is perfect, the "clunk" of the switches, even the subtle texture of the plastic feels exactly like the original. It's just fantastic. I think my love of modern mechanical keyboards can be directly traced back to this era of computing, and the feel is wonderful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping with the original in every possible way, however, is going to require you to unlearn some of the modern keyboard placements you've been using since things settled down to a standard layout. This isn't a fault with the design, it's unfortunately a byproduct of keeping things so perfectly retro. I find myself struggling with some of the key placement, like where the double-quotes are (they're over the 2-key, by the way). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the C64 is the computer you grew up on, your muscle memory might come back to you easily. But otherwise, there's a little more hunting-and-pecking here than I've done in years. It's not a fault of the design at all, and it can't be avoided, but it's just something that you'll definitely experience when you shift from the modern keyboard layout burned into your brain. And I wouldn't want it any other way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7206-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One major, positive design change is the power supply. The original C64 power supply was a brick almost literally, and pretty much every original C64 power supply is waiting to someday blast the original hardware with an overvoltage that will run it. The new one is cased in transparent plastic and doesn't take up half your desk like the original monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It plugs in right next to the multifunction button, a rocker-style switch that turns the Commodore 64 Ultimate on and off and lets you switch to the special configuration menu. It took a little more effort than I was expecting, and it's just a touch too small for my large hands. Turning off the Commodore 64 Ultimate requires you to push down and hold for 4 seconds, and I don't like that. More than once, I thought I'd activated the button, but was instead standing there like an idiot with the button 90% pressed for 10 seconds. Given the change of configuration of slots and peripherals, I would have liked a two-position switch for power and a momentary switch to go between C64 and configuration modes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Software </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In keeping with the retro-modernity of the Commodore 64 Ultimate, there's a USB stick in the shape of a cassette tape, complete with cassette case, included in each box. You plug it into a very modern USB port in the back and then access it via the configuration menu in a very old school, hierarchical file system type of way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7209-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The software on the drive is generous, to say the least. There is so much here, it's overwhelming. Rather than go through every single included piece of software (which I wouldn't mind doing, honestly), I'm going to touch on some of the more notable programs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But before I do that, I'm going to shout out a feature they didn't need to include, but they did anyway: when you start up a program from the file browser, the Commodore 64 Ultimate starts whirring and clicking, with the occasional buzz for good measure. It's making the sounds you would expect from a program loading from a floppy disc and it's absolutely wonderful. When I was a kid using computers, I loved the feedback of those mechanical drives. I always felt like I was listening to the computer "think." This little feature adds so much to the experience, in a way I didn't expect at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the software, there are dozens of demos on the USB drive, and not the ones we're all used to. The demo scene, while still around, is a pale reflection of its former self. Basically, programmers and hackers would flex their skills by creating demonstrations of their programming prowess. They would push machines to do things that didn't seem possible with custom animations and music, and you can see some of them here. One of the most notable and well-known demos is Bad Apple, presented here as Bad Apple 64. The Commodore 64 Christmas Demo is also on the USB, which is delightful. I'm nothing if not full of holiday cheer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7218-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a huge selection of games on the USB, but maybe my favorite addition here is GEOS, a graphical user interface designed specifically for the Commodore 64. While I don't see myself switching from macOS to GEOS any time soon, it's so cool to see this rudimentary GUI running on original hardware. Unfortunately I can't locate my compatible Commodore 64 mouse, but there are still dedicated hobbyists out there making them in our modern times, and Commodore sells compatible devices on its own site.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's so cool to see a rudimentary GUI running on original hardware.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a little surprised you can't use a modern USB mouse, which would have been much easier for the end-user. I don't think it would have taken anything away from the experience, either. In fact I'd argue it would enhance it, given most people own at least one USB mouse but very few people own compatible Commodore mice. I dug through the various menus and didn't find any options, but if there's a way, please let me know. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/geos-1765917516379.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm mildly obsessed with different GUIs, and will take any opportunity to try them out, so I'll probably scour eBay for a mouse, especially because it also has a whole suite of GEOS software. If I really wanted to (and I do), I have the option to hook up a Commodore printer and print off my own beautiful GEOSPaint creations, or I can use the Virtual Printer and save generated files to the USB as .pngs. From there I can just open it on a modern computer and print it from there. And friends, best believe I'm going to be doing that once I get a compatible mouse.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/commodore-64-ultimate-review]]></content:encoded>

It comes with the news that Terminator: Survivors, as many may have guessed, will no longer make its previously announced plan to launch before 2026, but the delay isn’t the only bad news for fans.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer co-op, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-survivors-first-details-trailer-nacon-direct"><u>was said</u></a> to allow players to survive a post-Judgment Day Earth with up to three friends, has been completely cut from the experience. Ponte stops short of explaining exactly why co-op will no longer be included but says the decision follows “months” of testing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic ‘Terminator’ experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer,” Ponte says. “We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-open-world-survival-game-nacon-announced">announced</a> Terminator: Survivors in July 2022 as a survival experience set in the classic sci-fi universe, eventually going on to reveal a release date of October 24, 2024. Of course, that plan never came to fruition, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-survivors-early-access-release-delayed-to-2025"><u>a delay in August 2024</u></a> pushing launch to an unspecified date in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with not so much as a launch window on the calendar, Nacon says it’s shifting its focus away from early access, too. Ponte says Nacon wants players to step into a “complete and polished experience” when the release date eventually arrives. The studio directs players to <a href="https://my.nacongaming.com/en-GB/playtests" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sign up for closed playtests</u></a> while development continues.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Terminator: Survivors Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know expectations are high, and we can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on,” Ponte adds. “For now, I can only thank you for sticking with us as we do our absolute best to create a game worthy of the Terminator legacy. We’ll be back with more news as soon as we can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Terminator: Survivors is currently set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-solix-c1000-at-record-low-for-christmas-on-amazon-charge-10-devices-with-2000w-output-at-once-2000653967</link>
            <guid>1385452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When storms knock out power in the winter, portable power stations are very important because you need backup power for heating, medical devices, or just to stay connected in case of an emergency. The <strong>Anker Solix C1000</strong> (Gen 2) fixes the main problems with older portable power stations by charging much faster and giving off more power.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">newer model is now $371 on Amazon, down from its regular price of $549</a> and it is close to the lowest price ever, just before Christmas when power outages caused by bad weather become more common. The <strong>32% discount makes it easy to get serious backup power</strong> without having to deal with the hassle and cost of installing whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charging Speed That Makes All the Difference</h2>
<p>When you plug the HyperFlash technology into a wall outlet, it <strong>recharges the whole 1,024Wh battery in just 49 minutes</strong> and it changes how you use portable power stations during long power outages. Traditional models take 6 to 8 hours to fully charge, which means you have to carefully ration power or risk running out at important times. This unit, on the other hand, lets you charge it up during short power restoration periods: If the power goes out for a short time, you can drain the battery that powers important devices and then fully charge it during a one-hour lunch break.</p>



<p>With a <strong>continuous output of 2,000W and a surge capacity of 3,000W</strong>, it can easily handle most power tools and household appliances. The 1<strong>0 ports include AC outlets, USB-A ports, USB-C ports, and a car outlet</strong> and you can use all of them at the same time to run your refrigerator, space heater, coffee maker, and phone charger. The 3,000W surge rating can handle the spike that motors make when appliances first turn on, so your refrigerator compressor won’t shut down when it starts up or your circular saw won’t stop spinning when it starts up.</p>



<p>The <strong>LiFePO4 battery chemistry can be charged 4,000 times before it drops to 80% capacity</strong> which means that you can use it every day for about 10 years before you notice a big drop in capacity. Lithium iron phosphate batteries work better in extreme temperatures than regular lithium-ion cells. They keep working in hot summer cars and cold winter garages, where other types of batteries have trouble.</p>
<p>When the power goes out,<strong> the under-10ms UPS switchover time keeps sensitive electronics</strong> like CPAP machines, computers, and networking equipment running without a hitch. When the power goes out, traditional power stations take hundreds of milliseconds to find the problem and switch to battery power. This can cause computers to restart or medical devices to sound an alarm.</p>
<p>Getting the Solix C1000 Gen 2 for $371 is a great deal because you get advanced charging technology and a lot of storage space for almost half the regular price. The almost-record discount makes professional-grade backup power affordable for families that couldn’t afford to buy generators before. The timing is perfect because it’s right before winter storm season, so you can get ready before you really need it. This Christmas deal is too good to pass up for anyone who needs backup power or off-grid capabilities.</p>

                <p>The Deciphering the Data quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> sends you to Spaceport to check out some Magnetic Decryptors, and finding exactly where they're located can be a bit of a challenge. However, you've come to the right place, as we'll tell you exactly where you can find both locations you need to interact with to complete this quest from Shani.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete Deciphering the Data--but we recommend you run a free kit either way, as you may come across other raiders working on the quest, too, and you wouldn't want to risk losing your gear if a fight breaks out while you're busy exploring.</p><p>When you're ready to take on Deciphering the Data, follow the steps below.</p><h2>How to complete Deciphering the Data in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The first step of Deciphering the Data sends you to the Fuel Control building, which is located on the northeastern portion of the Spaceport map. This building is very dark inside, so don't be afraid to turn on your flashlight if needed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624313" data-ratio="0.562524500196" data-width="2551" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624313"></a><figcaption>Fuel Control building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg"></figure><p>In the main (very dark) room, you'll find a ton of computer terminals. Along the southeast wall is a different kind of machine that you can interact with to use the Magnetic Decryptor. This will provide you with a new objective, tasking you with visiting the Arrival Building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624315"></a><figcaption>Decypher the data at this machine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg"></figure><p>The Arrival Building is located on the northwestern side of the map, so you'll have to cross some open space to reach it efficiently.

They're all equally prone to have extraction campers, especially if you did this quest at night, but you should be fine as long as you find a safe spot to wait things out and keep your eyes and ears peeled.

            <title><![CDATA[Terminator: Survivors Delayed Into 2026, No Longer Includes Co-Op, Now An Entirely Single-Player Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-delayed-2026-no-longer-includes-co-op-no-more-early-access-release/</link>
            <guid>1385425</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In 2024, Nacon Studio Milan confirmed that its multiplayer co-op game, Terminator: Survivors, would <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">no longer be released that year as previously planned</a>, and would instead arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2025. Now, with a little more than two weeks left in 2025, Nacon Studio Milan <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725">has confirmed</a> that Terminator: Survivors has been delayed and will not be released in 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from a post on the game's Steam page, where the developer outlines its goals with Terminator: Survivors, and not only confirms its delay, but also confirms that it has made a major change in direction. Terminator: Survivors will no longer include a co-operative multiplayer component, and will now be an entirely single-player game.</p>



<p>Nacon Studio Milan also confirms that the game will no longer launch as an early access title, and will instead launch in its full 1.0 state whenever it is ready, sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Our aim with Terminator: Survivors has always been to bring you an authentic and immersive open-world Terminator experience that recreates the harsh reality of Skynet's uprising, and the resilience of humanity in spite of it</em>," the post reads. <em>"After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we cam to the conclusion that to give you an authentic 'Terminator' experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer."</em></p>



<p>"<em>We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgement Day. We've also had to overhaul our release plans, instead of launching in early access, we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience.</em> <em>You might have guessed already, but that means Terminator: Survivors won't be launching in 2025. We don't have a new date locked in, but we'll let you know when we're ready to share a new release date</em>."</p>



<p>Considering the fact that we went the whole year up until now without hearing from Nacon Studio Milan on Terminator: Survivors, the news of the delay wasn't exactly surprising, but the rest of it certainly is. You don't expect to hear about a game like this changing direction in a serious way, partly through development.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they get it in their hands, and to see if we'll be able to decipher what elements of the final game may have been left over from its previous approach to the Nacon Studio Milan took all the way through to the game's launch. </p>



<p>In the meantime, if you're really hankering for a Terminator game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-once-again-still-launch-in-2025/">Terminator 2D: No Fate was able to get out the door before the end of 2025</a>, and launched on PC and consoles just a few days ago.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Mark Rosewater has released a sneak peek at the next <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set. The new <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> teaser has provided tiny snippets of information regarding the set's new cards, creature types, and gameplay mechanics. Here is what was revealed.</p><p>Like all prior glimpses behind the curtain, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser was revealed through a post on Rosewater's <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/markrosewater/803004920167120896/maros-lorwyn-eclipsed-teaser-before-previews" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Tumblr account</a>. As is tradition with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-tarkir-dragonstorm-teaser-gives-fans-sneak-peek" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">past sneak peeks</a>, the teaser contains partial information, snippets of game text devoid of context, in four distinct batches. These are designed to give dedicated <em>Magic</em> players a small glimpse at how the new set may change the play dynamics at the table.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-shaman-artwork.jpg?itok=IKl3PFzM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-shaman-artwork.jpg?itok=z9F3vll4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>The first batch reads as follows:</p><div><ul><li><span>A planeswalker that makes Kithkin creature tokens</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Kindred reprints</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Some counters in the set: charge, dream, flying, first strike, indestructible, and lifelink</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Another card in the Thirst for ________ series</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Another card that makes something a Coward</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A card that tutors every turn</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A new card that copies triggers</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A keyword introduced in 2025 returns</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A number of Lorwyn/Shadowmoor block mechanics have cameos</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Some tokens in the set: 1/1 colorless Shapeshifter, 1/1 blue/black Faerie, 2/2 black and green Elf, 3/3 green Elk, and 3/4 green Treefolk</span></li></ul><p><span>As per usual, some of this information is straightforward. A Planeswalker that makes Kithkin tokens isn't too wild, given the Kithkin are a major race in Lorwyn. The return of certain Lorwyn and Shadowmoor block mechanics is expected as well.</span></p><p><span>But there are some pleasant surprises. Various Kindred cards getting reprinted is sure to delight players who use any color in their decks. There are also some head-turning phrases. A new card that copies triggers is interesting since it can potentially lead to greater multi-card combos, and a returning keyword from 2025 could mean anything.</span></p><p><span>The second batch of the Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser focuses on rules text. For those interested in how this set may shift the meta, this is where a lot of speculation lies. The batch reads as follows:</span></p><ul><li>“As this artifact enters, choose Elemental, Elf, Faerie, Giant, Goblin, Kithkin, Merfolk, or Treefolk.”</li><li>“where X is the difference between its power and toughness.”</li><li>“Counter all spells your opponents control”</li><li>“Spend only to cast spells with a mana value 4 or greater.”</li><li>“If this is the third time this ability has resolved this turn,”</li><li>“This creature enters with six -1/-1 counters.”</li><li>“At the beginning of each end step, if you put a counter on a creature this turn,”</li><li>"You may cast that card without paying its mana cost if the spell’s mana value is less than or equal to the amount of life you gained this turn.”</li><li>“Add X {G} or X {W} where X is the number of other creatures you control.”</li><li>“Double all damage that sources you control of the chosen type would deal.”</li></ul><p>As expected, the rules text covers many different playstyles. Control decks will enjoy just countering all enemy spells. Those who enjoy high-cost cards may enjoy a resource for cards costing four or more. And there is some mechanics around tokens for those who like engines that ramp up.</p><p>Some rules do stand out. Doubling all damage a chosen type deals can potentially lead to novel twists on burn playstyles, and a card that can be played for free based on life gain could mean a new focus on White spells and life gain.</p><p>The third and final batches of the Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser focus on creature types and card names in the set. Those batches read as follows:</p><ul><li>Creature – Kithkin Ranger</li><li>Creature – Elemental Scout</li><li>Creature – Faerie Assassin</li><li>Creature – Noggle Rogue</li><li>Creature – Goblin Sorcerer</li><li>Creature – Ouphe</li><li>Creature – Giant Mercenary</li><li>Creature – Treefolk Cleric</li><li>Creature – Horse Serpent</li><li>Legendary Creature – Elf Faerie Noble</li></ul><div><ul><li><span>Bark of Doran</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Champions of the Perfect</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Chaos Spewer</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Flitterwing Nuisance</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Gilt-Leaf’s Embrace</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Glister Bairn</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Mirrorform</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Moonglove Extractor</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Moonshadow</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Scuzzback Scrounger</span></li></ul><p><span>Generally, this batch is full of expected terms for </span><em><span>Lorwyn Eclipsed</span></em><span>. It is a faerie-coded set, so much so it is now </span><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-digital-supplement-lorwyn-first-light-brings-fey-mischief" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><span>part of the Feywild</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></em></a>. As such, seeing Faerie Assassins, Elf Faerie Nobles, and Goblin Sorcerors are not surprising. As for the names, they do hold interesting connotations for the rules presented above.</p><p>Lorwyn Eclipsed is set to release worldwide on January 23, 2026.</p></div></div></div>

Both include a 7-inch LCD display (which is quite a bit larger than the 3.5-inch display of My Arcade), so be sure to give them a look while they're on sale.</p><p>Interested in other retro gaming solutions?
