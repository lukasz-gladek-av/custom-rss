		<p>Skydance Games has announced that their upcoming VR melee action game Skydance’s Behemoth will arrive on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 and</a> 3, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> and PC VR on 14th November.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's BEHEMOTH - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVTYfIbldAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Skydance will be out in force during Gamescom, offering all and sundry demos to sample the game –&nbsp;head to Hall 10, botth A-042 – as well as debuting a limited-edition graphic novel to delve into the setting of the Forsaken Landsand story. This has been penned by New York Times-bestselling author and game designer Matt Forbeck with illustrations by renowned comic artist Daniele Serra, with a small batch available each day from 21st to 25th August.</p>
<p>Following on from their acclaimed The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners games with an original new world, Skydance Games is shifting focus more in the direction of melee combat through dark fantasy world. The elephants in the room, though, are the titular Behemoths, huge creatures that you’ll have to battle, and which bring inevitable comparisons to Shadow of the Colossus.</p>
<p>We went hands on with Behemoth a few months ago, sampling a trimmed down demo level and encountering the first of these Behemoths. I said that “Whether your VR headset sees regular use or has been gathering dust in recent months, Skydance’s Behemoth is shaping up to be a great reason to pop it on and fight through its blend of human-sized and gigantic enemies.”</p>

Flame Fatales, the all-women and femmes charity speedrunning event from Games Done Quick, returns for another week-long programme of  impressively swift gaming feats this weekend.
</p>
<p>
This year's Flame Fatales (which will be the event's fourth outing since its launch back in 2021) gets underway on Sunday, 16th August. More specifically, things kick off at 6:15pm BST, with a Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores 100% speedrun by RE_doc19.
</p>
<p>
Seven days - and more than 50 speedruns - later - this year's Femme Fatales comes to a close at 4:06am BST with a Super Mario Odyssey Talkatoo% speedrun by CheeseJay. In between, you can expect speedruns for the likes of Persona Dancing, Sonic CD, Broken Age, Stray, the Resident Evil 2 remake, Rez, and plenty more - as outlined in <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/49">this year's full schedule</a>.

<p>
Speedrun fans can watch Flame Fatales 2023 <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">as it happens on Twitch</a>, and the event will once again be raising money for the Malala Fund, a non-profit that "works to secure free, safe, and quality education for girls around the world".
</p>
<p>
Last year's event raised $110K USD for the Malala Fund, while Flame Fatales' winter equivalent - Frost Fatales - raised $155K. Expect more charity speedrunning from Games Done Quick later this year, and you can catch up on its previous events <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/gamesdonequick">over on YouTube</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For all the early promise of PlayStation VR 2, eighteen months on, it feels like Sony’s second crack at virtual reality gaming is already running out of steam. There’s next to no sign of first party support, leaving the console-based VR headset to rely on third parties. So how to build up a fresh head of steam? Well… how about filling your head with SteamVR thanks to a new PC adapter?</p>
<p>The PSVR2 PC Adapter is pretty much exactly what this headset needs to prevent it from becoming a gaming cul-de-sac if and when Sony decide to call it a day.</p>
<p>Setting up PSVR 2 on PC is relatively straightforward, with a few key caveats. Sony has pushed a PlayStation VR 2 app onto Steam to provide drivers, basic setup functionality and updates, and a direct tie into the go-to library for PC VR games. With that installed, you just put cables in the right spots on the breakout box, go through putting the headset on for the first time, connect the Sense controllers, and hop into SteamVR’s built-in hub.</p>


<p>Simple, right? Well… Sony has somehow managed to make it feel more difficult than it should be. For one thing, there’s no DisplayPort 1.4 cable included in the box, so you’ll have to bring your own, which is a bit of daft penny-pinching if you ask me. Conversely, I wish the USB cable was detachable as well.</p>


<p>Then there’s a whole palaver surrounding Bluetooth adapters and the Sense controllers. The minimum requirement here is for Bluetooth 4.0, but Sony has a minimal set of just four recommended Bluetooth 5.0 USB adapters, which crucially are not guaranteed to work – just a quick look at Reddit will tell you that people are not having a universally good time with these four.</p>
<p>This is actually a problem that’s potentially a bit blown out of proportion. USB Bluetooth adapters are tiny and have minimal antennae that are liable to interference, whether from 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi or the electronic noise of a USB 3 port – Sony’s help pages do suggest using a USB 2.0 port far away from USB 3.0, and to use an extension cable for this reason. What’s not stated on Sony’s compatible adapter page is that motherboards with Wi-Fi built in will typically also have Bluetooth in the same chipset and (so long as you connect them) better antennas than a USB adapter, and so are very likely to give a better experience. For what it’s worth, I’ve had no problems with an older Asus USB-BT400 adapter (not the recommended USB-BT500) placed close to my play space.</p>
<p>Of course, much like including a DisplayPort cable, Sony could have built a single-purpose Bluetooth chip into the adapter, given it a half-decent antenna, and made this all as seamless as possible for something like $5 more.</p>

<p>Once you get past any of these hurdles, though, the full breadth of PC VR gaming is open to you. Half-Life: Alyx is sure to be one of the first stops for PlayStation VR players, whose hopes for a PSVR2 port have gone completely unanswered in the past 18 months. I’ve never owned a PC VR headset, and stepping into the distinctive Half-Life setting for an introductory hour of VR has been fantastic –&nbsp;the basic interactivity of picking up a marker pen to draw on a window, the grimy pre-Half-Life 2 setting, it’s still a great showcase for what VR gaming is capable of, four years on from release.</p>
<p>Racing game fans also have an embarrassment of riches to choose from – there’s&nbsp;Dirt Rally and EA Sports WRC from Codemasters, F1 2022 and newer, Assetto Corsa, and more. As good as Gran Turismo 7 is in offering the full fat version of Polyphony’s racing game up for VR, there hasn’t seemed to be much interest from other developers to follow, after the early experiments on the first PSVR.</p>
<p>And speaking of the last generation headset, one of the biggest boons that this PC adapter offers is access to the full back catalogue of VR gaming. For whatever technical or business reasons, Sony didn’t offer a backward compatibility layer for the new headset, relying instead on cross-gen ports, and that means there’s a large number of great VR games trapped on the original PSVR for console players which can be found on PC –&nbsp;and since my PSVR unit suffers from a nasty case of tracking drift, these became games that I struggled to enjoy for more than half an hour.</p>

<p>Of course, this will mean buying these games again, but since they’re older titles now, they’ll often be found in sales. I’ve picked up Star Wars: Squadrons in the past for just a few quid – note, it completely ignores the Sense controllers, so you’ll need a gamepad, and there’s some strange technical quirks that limit frame rates – and I’ve put a pin on Hitman: World of Assassination to see when it falls into what I want to spend on it, since it was never updated for PSVR 2.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of appealing elements for using PSVR 2 on PC, but there are also some drawbacks compared to plugging it into PS5. Games on console can use full HDR, eye-tracking and headset rumble, while the Sense controllers can have haptic feedback instead of more basic rumble and adaptive triggers. Technically, I don’t think there’s much stopping Sony from expanding their drivers to enable these features for developers –&nbsp;HTC Vive added eye-tracking functionality in 2019, for example –&nbsp;but they haven’t for launch, at least.</p>
<p>There is a feeling that Sony are largely just tapping into the industry standard foundations that PSVR 2 was built upon. SteamVR already has support for finger sensing, so that works, and the PC adapter is seemingly equivalent to VirtualLink and USB-C Alt Mode adapters, which is what PSVR 2 uses for its single cable solution on PS5. In fact, PC gamers might well have native support built into their GPU, with reports that GeForce RTX 20 Series GPUs and Radeon 6000 and 7000 series GPUs with USB-C outputs built in work to power the headset –&nbsp;some of these ports and gaming laptops might not provide enough power, and Nvidia ditched USB-C for the 30 Series, so the adapter is still very relevant. It’s a shame that Sony hasn’t publicised this point, though.</p>
<p>And that ties in with my overarching sentiment for the PC adapter. This feels like Sony putting PSVR 2 on life support for their console business, especially given how company executives have spoken about its wider game development plans, and the cuts they’ve made to the overarching workforce. We’ll certainly see some third party support still, but that might also tail off if PS5 VR gaming doesn’t keep up with standalone headsets and PC VR’s audiences.</p>
<p>For all my grousing, having a PC adapter at all is a massive boon for anyone that’s hopped on board with PSVR 2 in the past year, and the problems with it are really just down to some unclear and muddled messaging from Sony. If a gaming PC is part of your life, then having a look to see if you’ve got a USB-C port on the GPU or picking up this relatively cheap adapter is a no-brainer. You get the full Steam and wider PC VR library, and the security that this offers to your investment, and outside of the PS5 exclusive Resident Evil VR modes and Gran Turismo 7, it’s easy to consider going all-in on PC VR.</p>
<p>As for VR curious PC gamers considering just such an investment, we just have to look at the alternatives. The Valve Index and HTC Vive platforms are significantly more expensive, while the comparatively priced HP Reverb G2 is a few years older and only goes up to 90Hz with its screen. Meta Quest headsets are significantly more flexible as they offer both standalone and connected use, but they don’t use USB-C alt modes for video, so can have compression artifacting to the image, which could counter the advantages of their pancake lenses. Compared to the alternatives, PSVR 2 is perhaps now the go-to PC VR headset, and especially if you can get it for a reduced price.</p>

			<p>Today, KRAFTON announced a partnership with Overwolf to bring an official modding program to the upcoming life simulation game inZOI. Hyungjun Kim, Producer &amp; Director of inZOI, stated:</p>
<p><em>inZOI is committed to encouraging easier mod creation and artistic expression from players. By partnering with CurseForge, we are providing a dedicated platform for inZOI mods, ensuring that our community has the best tools and resources to bring their creative visions to life. This collaboration reflects our dedication to fostering a vibrant modding community within inZOI.</em></p>
<p>Overwolf CEO Uri Marchand added:</p>
<p><em>UGC is the present and the future of gaming, driven by a community of passionate creators and players who want to shape their experiences and make gameplay their own. inZOI is the perfect environment for UGC to thrive and we are thrilled to partner with KRAFTON to provide safe, curated modding experiences into highly anticipated inZOI from launch.</em></p>
<p>As part of the partnership, Overwolf will work with KRAFTON to identify early access modders to create content in advance of the game's launch as well as create a safe and curated space for inZOI mods to be hosted on CurseForge.</p>
<p>inZOI is a life simulation game powered by Unreal Engine 5 that emphasizes the user-generated experience, giving players full control over the gameplay to alter any aspect of their world and create unique stories. inZOI ultimately aims to serve as a tool for creativity, with players able to share and discuss their creations through the in-game canvas.</p>
<p>Unlike other life simulation games, inZOI features photorealistic visuals. Key gameplay features include Karma, where players' past actions affect their future lives, City Edit for controlling weather and city billboards, and Group Activities for players to enjoy daily life together.</p>

<p>As a special treat for the inZOI community, KRAFTON is releasing a limited time trial of the character creation feature, inZOI: Character Studio on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. Available worldwide from 04:00 UTC, August 21st to 04:00 UTC, August 26th, this feature allows players to create their dream avatar, the 'Zoi', with over 250 customization options.</p>
<p>This isn't the first major Overwolf partnership on user generated content (UGC). Recently, CurseForge also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> premium mods on consoles for Studio Wildcard's ARK: Survival Ascended.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mirthwood-roadmap-promises-multiplayer-next-year-and-more.954105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-roadmap-post-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bad Ridge Games and publisher V Publishing have revealed an initial&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>post-launch roadmap, detailing some of the features that are coming to the morally-charged life sim after its release this September.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest addition on the slate for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is co-op multiplayer, which will be added to the game as part of a major update at some point next year. Both online and local play will be supported.</p>
<p>Post-launch,&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>will also feature support for modding on PC, and another update will add "heartwarming family dynamics" to let you start and grow a family.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-roadmap-festival-of-blossoms.jpg?itok=w02rKtxi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-roadmap-festival-of-blossoms.jpg?itok=5gX2lQV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Festivals are just one of the features making their way to&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>&nbsp;at or after launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Festivals are another major feature being added to&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>after its launch (or, technically, at launch). The first of these, the Festival of Blossoms, will start on September 11th alongside&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s launch, and more festivals offering "special activities and quests" will be added later down the line.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to seasonal content updates bringing themed rewards and activities around occasions like Halloween and Christmas. After all, it wouldn't be much of a life sim without Christmas and Halloween!</p>
<p>Naturally, there will be lots of other updates and content drops throughout&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s lifetime. The devs have confirmed that the game will feature both paid and free content, so if you're willing to pony up a little extra cash, you'll likely get some more substantial stuff.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, it's a life sim "inspired by&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley"><i>Stardew Valley</i></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>".&nbsp;</p>
<p>You play a character who flees a war-torn continent in order to start life anew in an unfamiliar land, and so begins the usual life sim day-to-day; befriending locals, exploring your town's surroundings, and generally becoming a part of the community.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a> on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date">September 11th</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things life sim.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24220559/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-trailer-gamescom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare is announcing the release date for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176005/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a> and sharing a new trailer to commemorate the occasion. Players will be able to return to Thedas — the name of the game’s world that is simultaneously a clever acronym for The Dragon Age Setting — on October 31st, more than 10 years after the release of the previous game, <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>.</p><p>Oh man, there’s some <em>lore</em> going on in this new trailer. Up until now, fans assumed that Solas, a companion from <em>Inquisition</em> who went rogue during the events of the game’s <em>Trespasser</em> DLC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/2/23152050/dragon-age-dreadwolf-4-bioware-ea">would be the main bad guy</a>. But this trailer confirms a burgeoning community theory that Solas is just a small fry compared to the game’s real big baddies — the Elven gods.</p><p>BioWare announced <em>Veilguard</em> back in 2018 but shared very few substantive updates until 2022. In the intervening time, some senior talent left the studio, including general manager <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151192/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-leaving-dragon-age-mass-effect">Casey Hudson</a>, executive producer Mark Darrah, production director <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567676/bioware-mass-effect-mac-walters-dragon-age-dreadwolf">Mac Walters</a>, and senior creative producer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801037/dragon-age-4-matt-goldman-bioware-ea">Matt Goldman</a>. Several employees, including several BioWare veterans, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843096/bioware-layoffs-dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect">were also lost to layoffs</a>.</p><p>Development on <em>Veilguard</em> was also impacted by changing trends in the video game industry. After the critical and commercial failure of <em>Anthem</em>, BioWare’s MMO-style action RPG with flying exosuits, BioWare’s parent company EA canceled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301634/dragon-age-single-player-only-ea-bioware-shifts">the planned multiplayer elements for <em>Veilguard</em></a> in hopes of capturing the kind of success enjoyed by other EA-produced single-player games like <em>Jedi: Fallen Order.</em></p><p><em>Veilguard</em> will be available for preorder today for $59.99 on PC and $69.99 on Xbox and PlayStation. Though the long development cycle, layoffs, and departures have fans concerned about the potential quality of the game, <em>Veilguard</em> arrives when single-player narrative games are experiencing huge success, most notably 2023’s game of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Comparisons between the two are inevitable, but based on this trailer — <em>we are so very back</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-glade">Tiny Glade</a> is a relaxing, wholly escapist building sim where you can kick back and summon villages, cottages and castles whilst listening to whimsical tunes without the worry of combat or busywork. This cosy game has received a lot of attention, <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1801342217724010897">becoming the fourth most-played demo</a> during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/steam-next-fest-2024">Steam Next Fest</a> and earning a place within our own list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-9-favourite-demos-from-the-summer-steam-next-fest">favourite demos</a>. It now has a release date - 23rd September 2024.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We don't have to wait much longer to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">the witchy cottages of our dreams</a>. Better yet, a bunch of new building options and locations have also been shared via the release trailer below. If you're still on the fence or were unlucky and missed out on the free demo, developers Pounce Light will make it available again alongside the full game release. Look out for it on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Tiny%20Glade%20on%20Steam%20(steampowered.com)">Tiny Glade Steam page</a>.</p>

</span></p></div>
<p>As you can see, Tiny Glade still has the procedural generation system that made the demo so popular. With a brickle brackle clackity clack, out pops different decor that you can cycle through manually, or leave to the fates to choose for you. There's a new water feature where you can add ponds, small fish and ducks (and yes, you can pet them). Trees placed on the water will bloom with reeds, and you'll be able to decorate the waterways with a variety of lilies to really see the biomes thrive.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed players will notice that the trailer offers an entire colour palette of brick options for buildings, including a few more weathered or ivy-spattered surfaces to really pop some character into your builds. A few other details I happened to notice which weren't in the demo are chimneys, balconies (which is fantastic as I had to mess around with pre-fab foundations to try to make this work in the demo), a trapdoor and more decorations such as banners and flags.</p>
<p>The trailer also offers another look at the different seasonal biomes we can expect on release - there are five in total - including a moody winterscape that is just begging to have the castle of Winterfell added to it. Then again, Winterfell has been recreated in a lot of construction sims. What would you build instead?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just announced that The Elder Scrolls: Castles will be released worldwide on September 10. This mobile-only game comes from the team that made Fallout Shelter, the overwhelmingly successful micro-title set at the heart of the Fallout universe. </p>



<p>Last year, Bethesda released The Elder Scrolls: Castles in limited markets but is now preparing to roll the game out globally.</p>



<hr>







<p>The Elder Scrolls: Castles is the first ‘new game’ in the TES universe since Elder Scrolls Online was released in 2014. As players wait patiently (mostly) for The Elder Scrolls 6, Castles will form a lovely stop-gap, even if it is ‘just’ a mobile game.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're thrilled to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/tescastles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TESCastles</a>, our newest mobile game from the team behind Fallout Shelter, will be launching globally on Sept. 10th!</p><p>We hope you all enjoy this game as much as we've enjoyed working on it. Hear from Production Director Veronique Bruneau and… <a href="https://t.co/OayYeiMC1f">pic.twitter.com/OayYeiMC1f</a></p></div>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1824098856260235507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It follows a similar structure to Fallout Shelter, with players creating a castle made up of multiple rooms and functions, ultimately ruling a kingdom that’s instantly recognisable as being set in The Elder Scrolls universe. They’ll take on quests, manage their resources, and ensure that their people are kept happy, fed, and protected.</p>



<p>This goes a little bit beyond Fallout Shelter, with the team at BGS giving players the ability to create ‘hero-style’ characters with high-tier equipment, sending them out to fight a range of creatures from the wider universe.</p>



<p>On September 10, The Elder Scrolls: Castles will be released worldwide, but for now, you can pre-register to get access as soon as it’s available.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/somber-echoes-is-a-compelling-if-familiar-metroidvania.954063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/somber-echoes-is-a-compelling-if-familiar-metroidvania<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After spending nearly two hours exploring a preview build of Somber Echoes, an upcoming Metroidvania from developers Rock Pocket Games and Lav Games, I've walked away feeling optimistic about its chances to stand out in a crowded field of similar titles. Though my short time with it didn't lead me to believe it'll be wildly inventive, its foreboding atmosphere, solid combat, and mobility-based exploration has left me feeling eager to see more.</p><p>Somber Echoes takes place entirely on the Atromitos, an abandoned spaceship left in the aftermath of some type of cataclysmic event. Players take on the role of Adestria, who has been tasked with searching the vessel for her twin sister, Harmonia, and stopping her from destroying the universe. Though the opening hours are light on dialogue and exposition, there's a compelling blend of sci-fi and Greek mythology at play here. During the preview, I ran into reimagined Greek gods like Ares and Hephaestus, and I imagine there are quite a lot more to meet throughout the rest of the campaign. The extent of their impact on the story is yet to be seen, but color me intrigued to see how the team will weave Greek tragedies into an apocalyptic space opera. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Somber Echoes - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Of course, you can't really have a Metroidvania without significant amounts of exploration, and Somber Echoes is off to a great start overall in that regard. Very early in the preview, I found the aether lantern ability, which appears to be the core mobility mechanic in the game. This allowed me to enter a ball of energy and then select the direction I wanted to eject. While I could only use this ability once per landing during the section of Somber Echoes I played, a tooltip in the menu promised more aether cores could be found to allow for additional uses. </p><p>And naturally, with vertical exploration being one of the driving forces of the experience, there were tons of areas I couldn't reach yet due to not having these eventual improvements to the aether lantern. I'm looking forward to propelling myself to some of those just-out-of-reach areas once I'm powered up enough to perform multiple jumps in the full version.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But even with the limited mobility in the preview, there were a variety of secrets to find around the derelict spaceship. I examined each room thoroughly and found plenty of fake walls and clever shortcuts, as well as some unusual dead ends that seemed like they could be home to additional collectibles or upgrades in the final build. With seven districts planned for players to explore, I suspect there will be hours and hours of interweaving rooms to have fun searching through. And a much-appreciated ability to name the rooms you've visited should make it considerably easier to remember points of interest you want to return to later.</p><p>Meanwhile, combat in Somber Echoes is a simple but satisfying affair, too — at least so far. Most enemies had only a few attacks in their arsenal, but careful attention was needed to identify how to react to each of them. Certain attacks were unblockable, and with no roll or dash to avoid them, parrying was the main option available to avoid taking damage. I did find that using the aether lantern to hurl myself over foes was effective at repositioning out of a tight spot, but getting hit mid-animation interrupted my plans a few times. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Still, being punished for trying to reposition my character was something I kind of liked. Some of these enemy encounters took place in tight spots that really forced me to consider how best to prepare to take them on, making otherwise straightforward fights feel more tense. Seeing creepy monstrosities rushing toward me from both sides with environmental hazards nearby and limited space to move was a rush, and I'm looking forward to more of that kind of level design in the full campaign.</p><p>Speaking of level design, there's some great environmental storytelling in the Atromitos' detailed backgrounds, which do an excellent job of selling its mythology meets technology aesthetic. But at least in the areas I explored in the beginning of my demo, the vessel was exceedingly dark. As much as I dug this dreary and desolate vibe, the limited color palette of orange and red coupled with some samey locations caused a lot of screens to blend together after a while. But more concerning is how the darkness combined with visually busy environments occasionally made it difficult to make out certain on-screen elements or define what was and wasn't playable space.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's some great environmental storytelling in the Atromitos' detailed backgrounds, which do an excellent job of selling its mythology meets technology aesthetic.</p></div><p>A time or two, I found myself jumping toward a platform only to realize that it was in the foreground (which has a way of making you feel especially dumb). Other times, some small ranged enemies blended into similarly-colored lights so well that I didn't even notice them until they damaged me. I would sometimes even briefly overlook something interactable that just looked like part of the background clutter.</p><p>These issues were never so frequent or intense that it ruined my enjoyment, though, and they largely appear to be intentional design choices meant to invoke a sense of constant dread and claustrophobia. I'll admit this somewhat disorientating direction hasn't fully clicked for me yet, but I also know it takes time to learn each Metroidvania's tricks and tap into the flow of its unique layout and mechanics.</p><p>Considering how enjoyable the game's combat and mobility can be, I'm looking forward to finding that flow in Somber Echoes and seeing what dangers lie ahead in the Atromitos. And I'm feeling fairly confident that I'll be able to do so because, while there's already a lot to love about it even in its pre-alpha stage, the team will be making improvements and adjustments that are certain to only elevate what is already shaping up to be an overall exciting Metroidvania romp. We'll find out for sure when it launches later this Fall.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Festival Season 5 launches this weekend with a headliner who's a pretty major pivot from Metallica: Colombian pop and reggaeton singer Karol G. As has been the custom for each season of Festival so far, Karol G will have two skins available to obtain--one in the Season 5 Festival Pass, and one in the item shop--along with a variety of instruments, jam tracks, emotes and other cosmetics. For good measure, Karol G will have her own Fortnite concert experience next weekend, and the new Festival season is bringing us some highly requested quality-of-life changes.</p><p>Season 5, which runs until November 2, adds an all-new Festival Pass to the game. The pass costs 1800 V-Bucks, as it did in previous seasons, and includes both free and paid tracks. Buying the pass will immediately get you the Bichota Season Karol G skin, and completing the pass will unlock a Karol G-themed mic stand and guitar, as well as four jam tracks--Qlona by Karol G, My Oh My by Ava Max, The Nights by Avicii, and Take Over Control by Afrojack and Eva Simons.</p>

<p>The free track, meanwhile, includes three jam tracks by Epic Games, an emote, an aura, and an extremely cool looking keytar at the end of the pass.</p><p>Over on the shop side of things, we've got Karol G's Bonita Jams bundle, which includes both two jam tracks and two emotes--one each for her songs Cairo and OKI DOKI. Starting on August 22 there will be even more Karol G in the shop, with the Karol G bundle--it's got a different Karol G skin, along with a mic stand, back bling, wrap, and the Provenza jam track.

This was a feature that Festival had at launch, but it was removed because it created streaming errors with songs, but it's finally returned. So the next time you screw up the opening part of Unsainted on Drums, you don't have to go backstage and find the song on the list again.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4350564-karolgfortniteconcert.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350564" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4350564-karolgfortniteconcert.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350564"></a><figcaption>Karol G's Fortnite concert experience will begin August 23.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4350564-karolgfortniteconcert.jpg"></figure><p>For people who have been collecting songs since Festival launched, a much-needed organizational change is here: If you archive a jam track in your locker, it will now hide it in your emote wheel and in the Main Stage song picker.

We might place ourselves out in front of them, directing them to where you need them to go while protecting them from the unexpected. The team comes to rely on us for direction and protection. We are out in front, sword in hand, team at our back. We charge into danger on their behalf and hack away the things that keep them from success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our mantra may be that we would never ask the team anything we would be unwilling to do ourselves. We work late nights in service of the game and the team, but we refuse to ask the team to do that themselves. By the time we finish that first game we feel exhausted, but we are satisfied that we did everything in our power to protect and lead the team. We got the game out the door. We have successfully released a game, and that is no small feat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the team seems dissatisfied with our performance. We were so focused on their protection that they avoided bringing their problems to us, meaning we often got surprised by threats at the start of the project. We started being nosy in order to protect the team from threats. Control of the project was reliant upon us, as nobody could make a decision without our involvement. As a result, the team felt creatively stagnant.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We led from the front, removing the ability for people to go out seeking their own paths or more effective solutions. Without their input we lead the team down dead ends. Our constant need to jump to the defence of the team leaves the team feeling like you don’t believe they can fight their own battles. They didn’t feel empowered by our actions, they felt that we did not trust them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This theoretical leader tried to do everything right. They had the team’s health and wellbeing at heart, and made it their responsibility to try and protect these things. But the reality is that for us to improve we need to first let go of any preconceived notions that we understand what leadership is. Leaders are not just experienced members of staff. They are not just protectors, advocates, or vision holders. They are all these things, and they change based on the needs of the moment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leadership in the studio is responsible for two things: the business and the people. We may have a publisher, development partners, clients, or stakeholders. These are all specifically business concerns, however. We are responsible to all of them, and where they land in our list of priorities will depend upon our title and where we exist in the studio hierarchy. The people in our team are always equal in priority to all these business concerns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where many leaders in the games industry fail is by focusing more on the business than the people. We are never just developing a game for a business, we are also developing the people employed by the businesspeople work on the games we sell to maintain the business, and in return the business pays the people. Ignoring one is detrimental to the other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This failing then is likely the fundamental motivator for the focus on people that came with every leader I spoke to. We were not discussing how projects get made or how to balance budgets, these things change depending on our position and place in the hierarchy of a studio. The one thing that every leader shares in common is the people that they work with.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's a consistent style leadership style among studios that treats it more like any other business. To make money, be profitable, hedge against risk, manage business and personal resources accordingly. There's a lot of focus on keeping stakeholders and shareholders happy so they keep funding games. It's valid and important, but at the moment I feel the pendulum has swung too far in that direction. Like, where's our culture? Where's the focus on mental health and work-life balance, and the hey, don't kill yourself crunching?"</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">- Chima Denzel Ngerem, Producer, Zynga</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reality of making games is that the individual games aren’t the product, the people making them are. We might make a single great game, but it will likely be our last if we fail to maintain or support the people that made it. A team will only go on to make more great games if they work for a business that respects and empowers them. Our responsibility as leaders is not to make great games, but to empower and retain the people that do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is telling then that so many leaders in the games industry discourage unionisation. I have spoken with leaders in past who explained this rose out of a concern for the employment of their teams. They were worried about reprisals by businesses, or funding going overseas. There are absolutely challenges and risks involved with unionisation, but these things do not outweigh the value of a strong union presence. As leaders, we should be pushing to ensure our teams are cared for. This can only truly happen if they are empowered to hold their businesses and its leadership accountable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Great leaders are not only willing to be accountable, they also actively seek improvement. They action the feedback they hear from their teams. They adjust their practices based on the input of others. This need not just be feedback about their personal performance, it could be feedback about the direction the project is taking or how things are being managed. Sometimes it is difficult to hear that feedback, but they have chosen a path of self-improvement. Every great leader is always learning what the best possible practice looks like, and are improving upon their own skills and techniques. Great leadership is the sum of its parts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The characteristics of leadership are universal. It’s not attached to a specific role or position in a hierarchy. It would be incorrect to say that a leader is somebody who has command over others. A leader is anybody who chooses to act with self-awareness of how those actions may impact upon others. They are somebody whose behaviour inspires and motivates the people around them. They take responsibility for people, for projects, and for processes. Anybody can be a leader.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no one way to lead people in the games industry, however. The expectations of a leader in a publicly held AAA studio will be incredibly different from those of somebody leading a small indie team, to say nothing of the cultural differences depending on where it is they are leading from. Great leaders understand adjust appropriately to their environment. The people and the projects change, and so the leader must be willing to change too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We may find ourselves put in a position where our options are limited. We have been given our own instructions from leadership above us. Even if we disagree we just have to enact it. It can be easy in such circumstances to feel powerless, to give up and walk away from the idea of improving our leadership when the people we report to are all too content in their own mediocrity. But today our team needs us to guide them out from the darkness, so that we might be better prepared for that moment in which we have the capacity to avoid putting them in a dark place in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Great leaders are set apart by their adoption of ongoing learning and improvisation. Every tool or skill that we have at our disposal has examples of both good and bad ways in which it can be used. We can very easily make wrong decisions for all the right reasons. Taking on the responsibility of leading others does not mean that we are perfect or avoid failure, but that we embrace and learn from our failures. It is the only way we can grow as great leaders in our own right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Working in the games industry means that every day is different. We work on creative products that have an immense variety of challenges and potential complications. We work with creative people who come from a variety of artistic and technical backgrounds. Leaders reside at the point between the project and the team, and so we need to have the capacity to work with both.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiclassing as a concept came about due to the need for leaders to be prepared for every circumstance. It is not enough to just be great at leading in just one way, we cannot just be a great protector of the team if we wish for them to be empowered to take creative risks. Protection is a great ideal, but we cannot only be protectors. We have the tools at our disposal, great leadership is knowing what tool is necessary in the moment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn’t a book of solutions to the unique problems we will experience throughout the course of our careers. It’s a book of the characteristics that enable us to solve problems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only certainty that we have is that nothing is certain. We must be open and prepared to experiment with style and process to best serve the unique circumstances of our team and the project that we are developing. Many leaders that I spoke with referred to leadership styles such as situational leadership or servant leadership, but heavily emphasised that these were just tools in their toolbox (Greenleaf, 1970; Blanchard, Zigarmi and Zigarmi, 2013). It is the fundamentals of these styles which we desire to achieve; changing in the moment, always in service of the people.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I haven’t really thought about myself as having a specific leadership style. It’s like a bucket that I fill with rocks. The rocks are the fundamentals that I rely upon, the things that cannot change. The spaces between those fundamentals is like sand, it’s flexible and made to fill the gaps. That space changes depending on the specifics of the circumstance, or the people I'm working with.”</span></p></blockquote></div><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- Keith Fuller, Leadership Consultant</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was expecting a variety of styles and perspectives to arise out of my research and interviews on leadership. Instead, I discovered that many leaders were gravitating towards specific traits with very little outside influence. Experience and practice within the games industry by those leaders who reflect and work on improving their practice leads to similar solutions. Perhaps it’s just the nature of games development that the appropriate response to change and the unknown is to embrace adaptability.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Crunch">Crunch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To have a foundational understanding of leadership and its role in the games industry, we must also understand crunch. However, it makes for a particularly challenging subject to discuss as it is so poorly defined. Even among the leaders I spoke with, many of them had differing feelings and definitions of what crunch was. Without a clear definition, it may be easy to say that crunch is just another misunderstood tool in our kit of tools. But crunch has a human cost involved in it, and we need to be clear on the reasons why crunch should not be an option we are willing to entertain as leaders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crunch has been a subject of discussion for the last decade, with coverage generally presenting it as excessive overtime. There were some leaders I interviewed whom responded as I expected with this simplistic definition; crunch (excessive overtime) is always bad, and we should never do it. But when pressed with examples of circumstances that other studios had experienced and had chosen to crunch, many leaders found it difficult to condemn their actions. If the choice was to keep the studio operating and ensure the ongoing employment of staff, and the only reasonable way to do so was an expectation of excessive overtime to get there, was that a trade worth making? A few leaders even saw value in the overtime, and the way it had bought the team together during a particularly difficult period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The issue with defining crunch as simply being excessive overtime is that it does not capture the real issue. While discussing crunch with game developers, there are three recurring themes: overtime, overwork, and burnout. It’s not unusual in any job to have a degree of overtime expected of you in your role: that you will work additional time if necessary to remain on top of your tasks. Defining crunch as just being overtime - even excessive - makes it easier to excuse. Overwork by comparison is a symptom of poor leadership. An overworked team is one who has been given more work than is reasonably achievable in the time allocated to them. Overwork can lead to needing to do overtime, but working overtime does not necessarily mean we are overworked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Burnout is a symptom, not a cause. It is a feeling that may arise out of crunch and any number of other negative circumstances in a studio. But unlike crunch, burnout is a particularly well-researched subject. The 2023 Game Developer’s Conference titled “Occupational Burnout in Games: Causes, Impact, and Solutions” (Boccamazzo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>et al.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, 2023) explores a model of occupational burnout proposed by Dr Christina Maslach, and contrasts it against the stories of game developers working in the industry (Maslach, 1998). Dr. Maslach’s model defines occupational burnout as the result of enduring overwhelming long-term stress, and identifies six contributing factors that lead to burnout:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workload, the mismatch between what you are assigned to do and what you are sustainably able to achieve in a given amount of time.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reward, the mismatch between the effort you put into a job and what you get out of it.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Control, the lack of control over your tasks and how you achieve them.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community, the lack of a sense of belonging or community in your workplace.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fairness, the perceived lack of trust, openness, and respect between you and the work environment.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Values, the mismatch between the things that are important to you and the things that are important to your workplace.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So when it comes to occupational burnout, focusing on individual resilience and self-care without changing the system is a bit like suggesting people just need to learn how to swim better in a leaky boat. Learning to swim is great, but we have to fix the boat.”</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">- Dr. Raffael Boccamazzo, Clinical Director at Take This inc</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we define crunch simply as the excessive application of overtime caused by overwork, then workload is the clearest connection between burnout and crunch. However, it is clear from Dr Maslach’s identification of the factors leading to burnout that there are many other potential factors involved in crunch. Game developers are typically not paid overtime, meaning that those hours spent crunching go unrewarded. The expectation to crunch is one that is dictated by leadership, leading to a lack of individual control over how the tasks are completed. The leadership setting those same expectations to crunch may or may not participate or take ownership of the failure that led to crunch becoming necessary in the first place. If the place we workplaces value on people and work-life balance, then being expected to crunch is a betrayal of those values and of the studio culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is possible then that the leaders that saw benefits in crunch were not actually crunching, they were working overtime. Dr Maslach’s model categorises burnout into three dimensions: exhaustion, ineffectiveness, and cynicism. All three of these dimensions must be true for a person to be experiencing burnout. We may feel exhausted after a long workout at the gym, but we aren’t ineffective or cynical. So a team working together to solve challenging problems and empowered to do so may not feel overwhelmed at the end of a long or challenging task. If we worked additional hours and feel good at the end of the tasks set before us, were we really crunching?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During my time at University, I worked with a friend on a project which we had drastically over scoped. I found myself asleep on the floor under my desk while he slept in his car. The following morning when the project was due to be presented, we found ourselves dishevelled but successful and proud of what we’d managed to achieve. That pride quickly turned to embarrassment as - unshaved and smelling like two-day old university student - students from the school of music came to discuss creating soundtracks for our games. We left unscathed, but it made me quickly realise the importance of scope and taking care of myself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was somewhat ironic then that I ended out working on projects with that same friend that would see us repeating this kind of behaviour. But now it was not because we had misunderstood the scope. Presented with extremely tight deadlines on projects that paid well, we had taken it as a challenge. Now instead of university desks, I found myself crashing on his futon after working well into the early hours on games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nothing about these memories is unpleasant to me. We were presented a challenge, we accepted the challenge, and it had a clear deliverable and deadline. We made the call to work late hours to get the projects delivered. There was a real sense of satisfaction and pride when we got to see people playing those games and hearing how pleased the business was with what we’d managed to achieve. We were working overtime, but we certainly did not feel that we were crunching.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Later experiences in my career would be far less positive. Working with a team well into the evening hours on projects that had been updated just moments before they were due to be submitted, only for them to break down and fail. We would stay back late, hammering away on the problem until we were ready to resubmit lest we miss our deadline. Just to hear back from our console partner days later that they had discovered multiple bugs with the build that would need to be fixed, and have the deadline pushed back. We would repeat these late nights over and over again for months as we worked to get the game finished within the limited budget and time that we had available to us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I recall one morning where I woke up and broke down after the night before had caught up with me finally. Feeling a responsibility to the team, I still went into work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In one case, we had made the decision to take on the challenge. We looked at the problem, measured ourselves as capable to the task, and we got it done. We delivered the project and the stress ended. In the other case it was a made necessary by leadership. At no point did anybody declare that we were crunching to get the task done, it simply felt like an expectation of us that nobody was willing to say no to. We were in it together as a team. Every time we went through that stress together, we quickly learned that any relief gained would be short-lived. There would be another push over the horizon, and we would be repeating the actions all over again. There was no satisfaction in delivering that project, just relief to be rid of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at the examples of crunch in the industry, the uniting factor among all of them is not just the overtime: it is the human cost. This is a conversation that started back in the early 2000’s with the story of the EA Spouse, Erin Hoffman. Posted on Livejournal in 2004, Hoffman describes the circumstances surrounding the employment of her partner who was working at Electronic Arts at the time. It paints a picture of a dysfunctional studio with a workload set on a schedule that would never be achievable in a reasonable timeframe. Developers would be expected to perform gradually scaling levels of crunch that would eventually require staff in the office thirteen hours a day, seven days a week (Hoffman, 2004).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The story of the EA Spouse would thrust crunch into the limelight, but it would do little to change practice in the games industry. Fifteen years later, and history would repeat itself at another Electronic Arts owned studio. Bioware’s Anthem would release in February of 2019 to a poor public reception, criticised for shallow gameplay and technical shortcomings. Just two months later, Jason Schreier would publish an article providing insights from the developers working at Bioware as to just how things went wrong.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Schreier’s article details a studio in crisis, plagued by indecision and mismanagement. Anthem was in development for nearly seven years, a lengthy period of time even by AAA standards. However despite this lengthy development the game did not begin to take shape until the last eighteen months of development, as decisions got made and core concepts of Anthem’s gameplay and narrative were finally solidified. Finally clear on what they were making, staff were required to crunch. For many it was too much, with some of the studios most experienced developers leaving the company due to the oppressive working conditions. This was so prevalent that staff at Bioware referred to these lost coworkers as “stress casualties” - a term typically used to describe members of the armed forces who are unable to perform their duties due to exposure to operational stress (Schreier, 2019; APA Dictionary of Psychology, 2023).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is this idea in art circles that great art comes from great pain, that art is unlikely to be good unless the artist suffered (Zara, 2012). Unfortunately, many industry leaders have seemingly adopted this same perspective. Under these leaders, crunch is treated like a workflow or process. They push to meet the deadline and requirements of the current milestone, and then they do it again and again until the project is finally completed. The people who remain at these sorts of studios tend to adopt a similar mindset of its necessity, or simply do not have anywhere else to go in order to support themselves or their families.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No piece of art is worth so much human suffering.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crunch is self-replicating, doing crunch leads to more crunch. This is due to the fact that measurements taken of team output during crunch fail to be consistent. Our teams output the first time they crunch may be more or less than the next time they crunch. That period that you crunch for becomes unreliable data; the team, when pushed, can achieve this sort of output. But will they achieve that sort of output for long periods of time if we continue to push them? How much turnover and how many stress casualties are we going to suffer from along the way?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what is crunch? It arises primarily from overwork due to poor scoping of projects. It may arise from overtime if it is long and excessive enough. And it is not unlikely to create burnout due to the lack of control a crunched team may feel. Leadership can identify and avoid many of the problems that lead to crunch: read enough stories out of the games industry about those studios that crunch, and it is either not unexpected by the team or just a choice made by leadership. Crunch is not a tool; it is a failure of leadership.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We may find ourselves in circumstances in which asking the team to work overtime may be an option or even necessary. Key to making such a choice is the need for leadership to maintain control. It must be temporary, brief, and followed by an opportunity to recover. This isn’t condoning or calling for overtime to become essential, but a reality of leadership and of making games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the room is on fire around us, the time to calmly escort the team out has passed. We are now in an emergency, and that requires acting with urgency and decisiveness. This is the time that we reach for the fire axe and direct our team with appropriate energy. We bark orders and push them to do whatever is necessary to get us all out of the building alive. As we stand outside and everybody catches their breath, the team will be understandably shaken by the experience. This is our time to step in and ensure their wellbeing, and to take care of them. We give them the time necessary to tend to their physical and psychological wellbeing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overtime is our fire axe. It is survival. It is urgent, rushed, and the focus is on getting out of the building. If we find ourselves here, then quality is no longer our priority. We are not in a place where we can criticise the form of the person swinging the fire axe. When we find ourselves in an emergency, we don’t blame our leaders for needing to put pressure on us to get out quickly. We blame our leaders for missing the signs that our building was a fire risk.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fire axe is an emergency tool. When we reach for it, we must be doing so on the understanding that we are going to be damaging something. We are breaking the glass, we are hacking down doors, and people might get hurt. It is essential that we have tools at our disposal to handle emergencies, but this is never a tool we want to rely upon to get work done over long periods of time. We should rightfully feel bad if we need to ask the team to work overtime, but sometimes it is better than the alternative. The best we can do in some circumstances is learn from the experience and work to prevent it from happening again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leaders are not perfect. We cannot predict every issue we will need to face. But crunch does not come out of a singular mistake, it comes out of a long-term failure of leadership to identify or act upon issues within a project. It is our responsibility to watch for the signs and do whatever we can to ensure that our teams never need to endure such working conditions.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
New World: Aeternum, the latest expansion/do-over for Amazon's middling MMO New World, is having an open beta on 13th September ahead of its full PC and console release in October.
</p>
<p>
Aeternum, if you're unfamiliar, emerged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-world-aeternum-pops-up-on-the-playstation-store">back in June</a>, amid some confused messaging that didn't entirely make it clear exactly what it was. And, truthfully, Amazon's marketing remains as baffling as ever. The gist, though, is that this is the same MMORPG released back in 2021, albeit with new features and a bit of finessing ahead of its debut on Xbox SerieS X/S and PS5.
</p>
<p>
It's got a pacier story (told through in-game cinematics and pre-rendered cut-scenes), combat improvements, cross-platform play, enhanced controller support, and more - while still retaining its other MMO bits like classes, crafting, and questing. Then there's New World's first-ever large-scale PvP zone, a new 10-player raid, end-game solo trials, and other additions.
</p>

<p>
And if that sounds in any way intriguing, New World: Aeternum's opening "experience" and questline through to level 30 - which includes mounts, arenas, and expeditions - will be available as part of a newly announced open beta for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S players on 13th September.
</p>
<p>
Things kick off at 5pm/9am PT and run until 16th September - and for those that want to absolutely maximise their open beta time, pre-loads for the beta client begin on 12th September. Notably, progress made during the beta won't carry over to the main game, but there'll be rewards to unlock that do.
</p>
<p>
As for New World: Aeternum's full release, that's scheduled for 15th October on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC. PC players who already own New World's base game and its Rise of the Angry Earth expansion will be upgraded for free. Those without Rise of the Angry Earth get the revamped main story and quest flow, but not the full Aeternum experience, as detailed on an <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/new-world-aeternum-community-qa">earlier Amazon announcement post</a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s <em>brat</em>? Okay, picture this: it’s been a long, hot day on a train and you finally make it to your bed and breakfast in Naples. On the way there, your taxi driver asked where you were from and then when you told him nodded silently and said “New York and Napoli… the same.” As far as you can tell, that’s true—all you’ve seen so far is winding narrow streets and luxury storefronts and the noise and chaos of a major city, a kind of city that feels like it’s built on a foundation that has always been there, just occasionally refreshed with a coat of paint. But your little bedroom with its little balcony is a better vibe. You’re sweating through your clothes and you need a shower so bad, but the breeze coming in from the open balcony, the swaying of the white cotton curtains, cold water already in the fridge for you, all of it makes you feel a peace you did not think was possible.&nbsp;</p><p>You step out onto the balcony and stare at the turquoise blue sea of the bay of Naples—soon, on a rainy day, you’ll visit one of the little islands in the distance, but you don’t know that yet. You turn your head and see what you think is probably Mount Vesuvius, and when you visit Pompeii in a few days your suspicions are confirmed. You think, “I could live forever in this moment,” this small morsel of time already feeling like hours, days, a lifetime. Your husband comes up behind you, kisses you, pulls you onto the bed, and you want to be so loud that everyone in Naples knows how sexy you feel. That’s <em>brat</em>.</p><p><em>Brat</em> is also the breakthrough album for Charli XCX, an artist I’ve listened to since her debut single “Nuclear Seasons,” which I first saw on Tumblr in 2013. It is the purest encapsulation of everything Charli: it is big loud beats and fart-y synthesizers and blunt non-rhyming lyrics and drugs and insecurities and passing moments of sincerity and reveling in people kind of hating you. It’s fantastic, and I’ve listened to it every single day since it came out. It’s bracingly honest, and often very funny (“Why I wanna buy a gun, why I want to shoot myself” Charli sings on “Sympathy is a Knife” and it cracks me up every time.). When I listen to it, I feel like it gives a voice to parts of myself that I’ve tried to hide from other people—the parts of me that are messy and unsure, but also some of the parts of me that are so confident that it’s embarrassing.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Charli xcx - 360 (official video)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJW-VvmRKsE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Brat</em> is also a meme: <em>brat</em> was an album released in June, and now we are all having our <em>brat</em> summer. It’s hard to describe what it means to be “brat” in this sense other than saying “listen to the album.” Patrick Zweig from <a href="https://aftermath.site/challengers-soundtrack-reznor-ross-playstation-wipeout-2097-ape-escape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Challengers</em></a> is brat; the G train, which barely runs but is fantastic when you can get it, is brat; Chloe Sevigney, Gabriette, Julia Fox and Salem Mitchell are all brat, and fittingly <a href="https://youtu.be/WJW-VvmRKsE?si=IvabFG6NMf74nFqP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all appeared in the music video for “360.”</a> Charli herself <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/fashion/the-business-of-brat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">describes brat as</a>, “You’re that girl who is a bit messy and loves to party and maybe says dumb things sometimes. She’s honest, blunt, and a little bit volatile.”</p><p>Sometimes I put the album on with the intention of just listening to a few songs, but I always end up listening to the whole thing. It has the ability to transport me so totally to a place and a mood, to make 7am on a Monday feel like a coked out 3am weekend night. Like that moment in Naples—Charli wrote at least one song on the album in the neighboring city of Sorrento—it is the feeling of the eternal present, the transcendence of being completely embodied in the here and now. It is a representation, one might <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-to-really-know-about-kamala-harris-viral-coconut-tree-meme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say,</a> of existing in the context of all that's come before you, though unburdened by what has been and imagining what can be.</p><hr><p>Kamala Harris is not my first choice for president; she is also not my last choice for president, which is the guy who is also currently in the running. I think she largely sucks and has sucked for a long time. Please don’t confuse these opinions for being against her run for the presidency; she is the best of a lot of bad options.</p><p>Her position as Attorney General of California meant that she was in charge of keeping people in prison, an institution I would like to see abolished. She’s great at political “moments,” like when she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/factsfirst/politics/factcheck_543af44b-2bfc-4050-964e-79ebdbd57142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admonished</a> Joe Biden for not supporting desegregation through federally mandated busses, but of course, she would also later become his vice president (not to mention that her own position on federally mandated bussing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/586b1e81cb684654b0cf689b9074c1cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a lot more wishy washy</a> than her mic drop implied).&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>As vice president, she has done a lot of nothing. She shows up to places and says stuff like “I love venn diagrams” and then disappears for months. On the fourth day of her presidential run, she put out a statement <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-condemns-flag-burning-pro-palestinian-protest-washington-2024-07-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemning</a> the people who protested Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress. My basic measure of her is that she is a coward with a spine made of jell-o who’s trying to get as close to the center of power as she possibly can.</p><p>Harris has also become the object of an internet meme that I find truly funny, and has what appears to be totally organic growth. Bolstered by fancams set to Charli XCX’s music, Kamala Harris supporters are now “coconut pilled,” in reference to Harris frequently using the phrase “you think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” to refer to the way that we all live in a society and are affected by the actions of others. This phrase, and Harris’s now iconic giggly laugh, have been remixed hundreds of times on TikTok, including one person who used these tones to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@melxsweetheart/video/7394728485434019104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreate Charli XCX’s song “360.”</a></p><p>The meme is easy to create—there is <a href="https://www.bratgenerator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literally a generator</a> that gives you the exactly correct hex code for the acid green background—but as a result, it has already crossed the precipice from fun to over-saturated. Writers like Arielle Gordon at Pitchfork have deemed Kamala Harris’ campaign’s embrace of the <em>brat</em> meme <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/brat-summer-is-dead-long-live-brat-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the end of “brat summer.”</a></p><p>“By the end of June, the month of the album’s release, some were beginning to grow wary of how long Brat Summer could last,” Gordon writes. “Would it, like so many other online phenomena that broke free of the cloisters of the internet, shrivel and die in the real world, like a string of hosta flowers wilting in a heatwave?”</p><p>“Harris, certainly more than Biden, seemed primed for a Brat Summer—she did spend June in Las Vegas, after all, albeit apologizing for Biden’s verbal miscues at the first Presidential debate,” Gordon continues. “Charli XCX, perhaps sensing the twin swells of support for two powerful women, wrote the post that would, in three words, signal the end of Brat Summer: ‘kamala IS brat.’”</p><figure></figure><p>If <em>brat</em> is a broad enough trend that it can signify annoying your boyfriend and making chilled zucchini soup and making amends with your powerful peers—as Gordon describes—then I suppose it being co-opted by the girlboss class was inevitable. Even if Harris being subsumed into the meme is the beginning of the end, I don’t think it’s an incongruous move. As much as I like <em>brat</em> (and I like it <em>so</em> much), there’s an emptiness at the center of the album that sometimes creeps up to the surface. For every moment like “I might say something stupid,” where Charli describes looking at herself in the mirror during a party and feeling a sense of alienation, the album will re-center around Charli’s perennial fascination with dead-eyed, amoral mean girls.</p><p>The world that exists for the 365 party girl, the protagonist of a Charli XCX album, is one that centers around annihilating the self. Sometimes it’s in moments of rare altruism, like the now well known communal experience of the girl’s bathroom at the club. Other times it’s about becoming one with the crowd, dancing and screaming to music. Sometimes it’s also about real self-annihilation, a state I’ve experienced too much, about trying to feel something other and better than being oneself (with the aid of a lot of drugs).</p><p>Here’s the thing about partying a lot, from someone who used to party a lot: when you’re rolling super hard and making friends in the bathroom line, you’ll feel like you know a lot about those other people as you share that moment in time. But you don’t. And in the light of day you might discover that many of those people are fucking freaks.</p><hr><p>It’s impossible for me to think about <em>brat</em> without thinking about Dasha Nekrasova, unfortunately. She’s somehow harder to explain to normal people than <em>brat</em>, despite having appeared as a recurring cast member on an <a href="https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Comfrey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO show</a>. Here’s the short version: she’s one of the two hosts of Red Scare, a podcast that once had a leftist patina but now is a reflection of the opinions of a racist Republican uncle who’s on the verge of being uninvited from Thanksgiving. This is hardly an exaggeration: most recently, Red Scare featured disgraced Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson as a guest. She’s also the inspiration for the Charli XCX song “Mean Girls,” which isn’t a bad song but is my least favorite from the album.</p><p>“Yeah, it's 2 a.m., and she's out there/in the sheer white dress, wearing last night's makeup,” Charli sings of the eponymous mean girl, before diving into a description that more specifically fits Nekrasova on the second verse.</p><p>“Calls him Daddy while she's fingering a gold cross,” she sings, “and she's kinda fucked up, but she's still in Vogue.”</p><p>The slightly longer version is that you probably have actually seen Dasha before—<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/sailor-socialism-dasha-nekrasova-viral-infowars-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she’s sailor socialism</a>, as featured on the HBO television show <em>Last Week Tonight</em>. In the clip that went viral, she’s responding to an interviewer from the Alex Jones-owned network InfoWars, wryly telling her that she just wants her friends to get healthcare. Ironically, Dasha would <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWlvBy1lIbj/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take a picture with Alex Jones</a> in 2021, after having him on Red Scare. She told the New York Times that she thought Jones was “an incredible entertainer.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Venezuela: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYfgvS0FA7U?start=91&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This viral moment would make Dasha an it girl for a very small social circle mostly centered around a small neighborhood in lower Manhattan that has dubbed itself “Dimes Square.” I don’t know that anyone outside of New York or online circles of horny leftist men think about her much. On TikTok, at this point the de facto gathering place for people younger than me, another woman named Dasha rules the “#Dasha” hashtag; most of the other popular videos <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reallynormalgirl/video/7378605893727931691?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7400133384528332318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that specifically mention Nekrasova</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tradfemmee/video/6948192118271675653?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7400133384528332318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are making fun of her</a>.</p><p>Describing everything I dislike about Nekrasova would only give her the upper hand. Even if she has fallen ever so slightly out of vogue–in the right bar, no one will say her name without rolling their eyes or scoffing–everyone still knows who she is. Explaining why she sucks will only reveal how much you know about her, which is a victory for someone who traffics in attention. “Mean Girls” puts this succinctly: “You said she's problematic and the way you say it, so fanatic, think she already knows that you're obsessed.”</p><p>I wouldn’t call “Mean Girls” a flattering portrait of people like Nekrasova, but it feels true to life.The entire vibe of <em>brat</em> is “I’m here for a good time, not a long time,” a kind of narcissism that absolutely could lead to an adult convert to Catholicism declaring Pope Francis a “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-court-the-red-scare-left-with-roger-stone-martini-hour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heretic</a>” and “<a href="https://x.com/nobody_stop_me/status/1537547973407784962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-pope</a>.” Watching young fans of Charli XCX call this album or the artist behind it “feminist” has been confusing because the album has no ideology except The Party, and the beautiful Party People that you see there. Despite <a href="https://redscarepodcast.libsyn.com/yarvins-room-w-curtis-yarvin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Scare having on Curtis Yarvin</a>, someone who Trump’s running mate <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/183971/jd-vance-weird-terrifying-techno-authoritarian-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JD Vance considers a political inspiration</a>, Dasha is mostly a Party Person. In the dark of the club, her political alignment is immaterial.</p><hr><p>Here’s the thing that I think Harris, Charli and Dasha all have in common: above and beyond all political ideology, what they desire is proximity to power. For Harris it’s not altogether surprising: she is a politician and she is running for president for a second time. If you want to be the most powerful person in the country, you are absolutely a fucked up person. But Charli and Dasha are their own kind of politicians as it girls, ones whose policy positions are mostly about people paying attention to them.&nbsp;</p><p>If <em>brat</em> works as a kind of it girl hagiography, a study in what it means to be an it girl, then Harris absolutely fits within that category. She went from being an unremarkable VP to not only becoming the party nominee, but polling higher than the looming specter of a second Trump presidency. It is entirely possible that Americans are on the precipice of the first it girl president.</p><p>Going to parties and having people actually remember you is kind of like campaigning for president of being cool. You do not want to be behind, or a trend follower—you want to make an appearance and then have everyone show up dressed like you the next night. You can achieve this by courting controversy, as both Charli and Dasha do in various ways, or by openly seeking out avenues to power, like Harris is doing. Harris is hypnotic to watch as a speaker, not so much because I am wowed by her rhetoric as I am surprised by her ability to orchestrate the crowd. Every time she prompts a crowd to chant her de-facto campaign slogan, “we’re not going back,” she whispers into the mic in rhythm with the crowd. She looks starstruck by her own machinations.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe this is what makes the dead-eyed, gravelly-voiced mean girls of <em>brat</em> so fascinating to Charli; they already have something that everyone wants by being beautiful, but they seem so bored by it. The only time Nekrasova has any light in her eyes are when she’s doing something on the internet that people will yell at her for, like going to a gun range to <a href="https://twitter.com/dash_eats/status/1813619330556522784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shoot at a target that’s clearly dressed as a Palestinian</a>. It’s the same glee that you see in Charli’s eyes when she intones the first few lines of her latest single, “Guess.” Flashing a coquettish look from camera one to camera two, she says, “you want to guess the color of my underwear,” smirking as the song becomes a paean to oral sex; she and Billie Eillish literally climb a mountain of underwear in the music video.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Charli xcx - Guess featuring Billie Eilish (official video)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/huGd4efgdPA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After Charli’s birthday party—<a href="https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/inside-charli-xcx-brat-birthday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she’s the ripe age of 32 now</a>—I saw a few people online call this the return of “indie sleaze,” referring to the New York music scene from the 2000s. I remember indie sleaze as it was happening; my husband is featured in a picture from a New Yorker article about an iconic DIY venue’s last show; I remember when Vice bought 285 Kent and I cursed them forever, and then a decade later took a job in that very warehouse space that Vice has since vacated.&nbsp;</p><p>While the photographer <a href="https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847867592/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cobrasnake</a> did give Charli’s party pictures that particular hyperreal aesthetic that was so popular at the time, the thing I liked about being in that scene when it was happening was that everyone was broke. The bands were all broke, the audience was broke, everyone owed everyone else twenty dollars, the entirety of Williamsburg subsisting on the same twenty dollar bill being passed back and forth. Sure there were people who were pretending to be broke, “Common People” style, but they had the temerity to know that their financial status made them uncool. By contrast, everyone at Charli’s party in Los Angeles is an international pop star or celebrity.&nbsp;</p><p>The nihilism of 2008 was ever present post-financial collapse, but it had a different tenor than Charli’s kind of self annihilation. The people I partied with were trying to build something in 2008—at the very least, they were building communities where they could make art and party together. Being <em>brat</em> is about Charli XCX and her fandom. It’s a fun party, but you’re not making something new; there is no chance of you “making the Cobrasnake” because you were at the right place at the right time wearing the right outfit. It’s absolutely a cool vibe, but it’s also just vibes.</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/we-cant-fix-the-internet-1828463761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politics is also a kind of fandom</a>—especially in the ways that it is enacted online. Kamala Harris’s campaign for president has been a stellar example of this, embracing the memes that surround Harris. Memes made Harris the heir apparent to the candidacy; memes uplifted Tim Walz from just the Governor of Minnesota to Harris’s running mate. You’re supposed to pretend that people like Harris and Walz are running for the good of the country, but given that <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there aren’t any policy positions on Harris’ website</a>, it is hard to say what exactly she stands for. We know one thing she believes, based on her response to protestors in Michigan who want her to condemn the genocide of Palestinians.</p><p>“You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-rally-michigan-interrupted-palestinian-protesters-rcna165675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harris said</a>. While she has added that she is open to meeting with the anti-Zionist “Uncommitted” movement, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/uncommitted-kamala-harris-gaza-1235076978/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she has yet to do so</a>. The very next day, Harris responded to another group of protesters with more grace, by saying that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/kamala-harris-calls-for-gaza-cease-fire-after-protesters-disrupt-speech/DAB2D9F3-C8F4-49C3-AC0F-1855EE5684AA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she is committed to a ceasefire deal</a>. While this was a much better response, it also highlights some of the issues with Harris as a politician: there’s no there there, she believes in whatever position will get people to stop yelling at her.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I believe that winning campaigns are driven by more than just aesthetics. Harris’ nomination gives people something to hope for, at least temporarily, because she’s not a walking corpse. The songs on <em>brat</em> are so refreshing because they do not strive to be girlboss anthems, because they talk about insecurities and also extreme narcissism, because they are both full of substance and totally empty at the same time. But the kind of person who embodies all those things, the character that Charli plays on the album and the one that Nekrasova plays online, are complete voids. While I hope that Harris has more substance, it makes sense that her campaign embraced the <em>brat</em> of it all. We’re not going back, but also it is unclear if we’re going <em>forward</em> or just living in the eternal present, the end of history where there is no injustice that we have to fight against, no genocide that’s ongoing—just vibes.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
